					<description><![CDATA[I really appreciate the advice you listed here to make sure that the attendees and business you want to market to are going to be at a trade show before booking your slot to appear there. It would certainly be a disappointing experience to end up in a place that was not at all designed for you and your business. I would think that there are probably people yo u can hire to help you plan and set up a booth like that, so for a first-timer that could be a good idea. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Rieva for the great tips!
I would only disagree with the last bit of it: 2 weeks is way too long for a follow-up.
At myfairtool we encourage exhibitors to follow-up instantly, or at most within 48h. Visitors have met many other exhibitors, they won&#039;t remember you two weeks from now.]]></description>
