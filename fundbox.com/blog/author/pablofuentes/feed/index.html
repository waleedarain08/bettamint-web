By definition, they tend to be people who prefer independence over a corporate environment. They don&#8217;t want to be tied to a desk—they&#8217;d rather have the solo freedom of being on-the-go!</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s some pushback to the idea of doing too much on your phone, don&#8217;t forget there was once pushback to using fax machines. Some argue that it isn&#8217;t practical to handle tasks on a mobile device, and yes, that may be true of a few specific, complex projects. However, in many cases, mobile adoption and new mobile applications are helping small business owners get more done—no desk time required.</p>
<p>A few years back, AT&amp;T published a study showing that <a href="http://about.att.com/mediakit/2013techpoll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">66% of small businesses could not survive—or it would be a major challenge to survive—without wireless technologies</a>. We believe this percentage will only continue to increase as more small business-centric mobile applications are developed.</p>
<p>Every day, small business owners are already using phones and tablets to move their businesses forward. Here are a few examples:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Email</strong></h2>
<p>This one goes without saying. Checking your emails while away from your desk improves your productivity—and at the very least, you can triage emails into delete/forward/quick reply/save for later. Try using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Outlook</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/mail/help/mobile.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail</a>, or <a href="http://www.getboxer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taskbox Boxer</a> are three email apps to check out.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Scheduling</strong></h2>
<p>A lot of apps making scheduling easy, such as <a href="https://joinhomebase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homebase</a>, <a href="http://7shifts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7Shifts</a>, and <a href="https://hotschedules.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HotSchedules</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>3. SMS/Messaging</strong></h2>
<p>For better or worse, we respond to text messages much more promptly than we do email. When there is a fire to put out, you can expect a call first, quickly followed by a text. Apps like <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skype</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> are also popular for timely responses and flash collaboration</p>
<h2><strong>4. Travel/Entertainment</strong></h2>
<p>You can easily book travel in just a few taps. Buying flights? <a href="https://www.kayak.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kayak</a> is your friend. Accommodations? <a href="https://www.expedia.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedia</a>, <a href="https://www.hoteltonight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotel Tonight</a>, and<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> AirBnB</a> have your back. Need a ride? <a href="https://www.lyft.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyft </a>and Uber are there for you. Booking a table? You can use <a href="http://www.opentable.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenTable</a>. Organizing it all? <a href="https://www.tripit.com/uhp/mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripIt!</a></p>
<h2><strong>5. Expenses/Financials</strong></h2>
<p>Even more complex tasks that used to be desktop-only are now going mobile. <a href="http://help.expensify.com/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expensify</a> can help you with your expense reports and <a href="http://www.indinero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InDinero</a> can help you keeps your books and payroll straight.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Hiring</strong></h2>
<p>Mobile hiring is on the rise. <a href="http://www.indeed.com/hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indeed</a> just released a new mobile app where you can post your job and manage the hiring process. <a href="http://www.proven.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proven</a> also has a <a href="http://www.proven.com/pages/mobileAppPressRelease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile hiring platform</a> that allows for posting and distribution to 20 job boards with a mobile applicant tracking system to boot.</p>
<p>Ten years ago nobody thought this would happen, but now small business owners are completing these tasks and more on mobile every day! As younger generations continue to mature and foray into business ownership, the percentage of people who rely on mobile devices like smartphone, tablets, and even smartwatches to operate their businesses is sure to increase.</p>
<p>What business functions do you think are the next to go mobile for small business owners?</p>
