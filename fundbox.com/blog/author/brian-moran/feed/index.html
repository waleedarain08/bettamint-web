I periodically read the book and laugh at all the mistakes I have made in spite of the words of wisdom from others. But what about the best advice I didn’t receive? If I had the opportunity to sit down with my 20-year-old self, what is the one thing I would say to him about being an entrepreneur or my 30-year journey of discovery?</p>
<p>I decided to ask some of my friends and family the same question. Below are their responses as well as mine. As you read their comments, keep in mind something my friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/normbrodsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norm Brodsky</a> once told me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“A smart man learns from his own mistakes; a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The best piece I never received and I had to learn the hard way was &#8220;delegation.&#8221; When I finally developed &#8220;faith&#8221; in my right-hand man that he could provide the same quality, service, and care that I knew I could, that&#8217;s when my business blew up (from 1 sports medicine center to 40 centers). Live while you&#8217;re alive &#8211; now! ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/pat_croce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat Croce</a></p>
<p>Here is what I wish people had told me (but no one did). Take vacations, get more sleep, manage your time, don’t forgo a salary as a startup, and lastly, you don’t have to feel guilty every time your say “no” to someone or something. ~<a href="https://twitter.com/rieva" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rieva Lesonsky</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy new if used will do. Watch the variable expenses because they will usually vary higher if you don&#8217;t watch them. You are almost never off on weekends. Make potentially bad situations a priority; they almost always get worse if not addressed immediately. ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/moranresremodel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Moran</a></p>
<p>Being smart is your admission ticket to the play; nothing more and nothing less. We can never rest on the laurels of our education or even our experience or expertise.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Clients expect excellence, creativity, innovation, empathy and opportunities to deliver value-added services each and every day.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Be complacent and you will be left behind. ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjsherman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Sherman</a></p>
<p>Starting and running a business is all about discipline and organization. It is a business; not a hobby. Do more with less. Don’t get the fanciest office space, and gadgets. Don’t start off with every single employee you “may” need. Don’t pay top dollar with top benefits. Shoestring is the name of the game until the concept gets off the ground and brings in revenue. Make sure bills go out promptly and payments come in promptly. And for those times when there is a hiccup – have a backup plan. Most businesses fail in the first year because they are undercapitalized. If your expectations exceed your reality – you will be one of those businesses in the dustbin of failure. ~ <a href="http://www.mka-law.com/">Siobhan Moran</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Even if you&#8217;re on the right track, you&#8217;ll get run over if you just sit there (Will Rogers).</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Even when you have the greatest idea or best new product ever made &#8211; the tough part will be convincing customers to stop what they are doing and either try or pay for something new. You must listen to them, be patient and persistent. Lastly, add six months to one year on every one of your projections. Pay attention to the plan you created for your business because it will surely change before your very eyes. ~ <a href="https://twitter.com/fleejack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fields Jackson Jr.</a></p>
<p>Failure is a positive asset in building your business. As long as you learn and evolve from it. Don&#8217;t repeat the same mistakes. Embrace failure, learn and evolve from it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ego is the greatest killer of the best ideas and businesses. Keep yourself grounded and objective.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Patterns are all around us and everywhere. A great entrepreneur can see them, understand them and act on them. ~ Peter Bordes</p>
<p>The advice I would give my 20-year-old self would be simple: workout every single day and eat healthy foods. Entrepreneurship can be a very rewarding, long-term adventure; you want to make sure you’re in a position to enjoy every single day.</p>
<p>Carpe diem!</p>

However, if you asked the same 100 business owners, how much do you worry about cash flow in your company, almost all would say it’s one of their top concerns.</p>
<p>Cash flow is the lifeblood of every small business! If your company was a car, cash flow would be the fuel that keeps it running. The challenge for business owners is to not only keep the tank full but to have fuel in reserve in case they get caught running low in between gas stations. In other words, business owners need money in a reserve fund in the event “net 30” suddenly becomes “net 60” or worse.</p>
<p>What is the best way for a company to maintain proper cash flow? Here are three suggestions that I have found work very well for most small businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay on Top of Your Receivables</strong> – It sounds easy enough…and why wouldn’t a business owner make sure they are getting paid on time? One of the biggest factors in driving small businesses into the ground is allowing clients to extend their payment terms, and then continuing to service their account. For example, you have a large client that represents 20-30% of your business. Typically, they pay net 30 days. However, there is a change in their billing system, and now they are switching everything to net 60 or even net 90 days. They tell you that, in order to keep their account, you must agree to the new terms. Before you say yes, what does that mean for your cash flow? Will you be able to get the same terms from your vendors? If not, you will quickly find a zero balance in your business checking account, and creditors knocking on your door.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create an Emergency Fund </strong>– Whether it’s a line of credit from your bank, money that you’ve been able to save, or access to funds from a relative or an investor, you need to have 3-6 months of business expenses at your disposal to maintain proper cash flow. This assumes that your cash flow interruption is a hiccup and not something worse. If your business is in serious trouble, you should consult with an advisor or mentor to discuss other options.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep an Eye on Economic Indicators and Disasters </strong>– What moves your market or industry? More importantly, what could disrupt it? If you own a landscaping company, it’s imperative for you to follow the ups and downs of the local housing or commercial real estate market. If you have a construction business, seasonal storms can wreak havoc on your existing projects. Sometimes, it’s not your business that gets affected, but rather your customers’ businesses. That’s when you realize how important it is to stay on top of your receivables. The worst time to call a customer about an invoice is AFTER disaster strikes. Whether it’s a natural calamity or a man-made situation (e.g. bankruptcy), the likelihood of getting paid drops measurably after a misfortune occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you stay on top of your receivables, set up or maintain an emergency fund, and keep an eye on economic indicators and potential disasters, you will experience far fewer sleepless nights than the business owners who ignored the gauge on their fuel tank.</p>
