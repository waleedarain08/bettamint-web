										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="511" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000027514695_Medium-768x511.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="personal credit report" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000027514695_Medium-768x511.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000027514695_Medium.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><i>Credit Score</i>. Those two words alone can strike terror into the hearts of even the most courageous small business owners—and with good reason. Your credit score is a huge factor in opening—or closing—financial doors throughout your lifetime. And for many, how it’s calculated is shrouded in mystery and misconceptions.</p>
<p>When it comes to credit, what you don’t know can hurt you. And because as an entrepreneur your <a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/2014/12/11/whats-difference-business-credit-personal-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business credit options are determined mostly by your personal credit</a>, what you don’t know can hurt your business, too. (The good news is that there some newer business lenders, like <a href="https://fundbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a>, look at more than just your credit score when making credit decisions.)</p>
<p>Avoid these six pitfalls that could damage your personal credit, cost your company <a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding options</a><strong>, </strong>or limit you from obtaining lower rates in the future.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake 1: You depend too much on one factor of determining credit.</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FICO® uses five separate factors to calculate your score</a>: the punctuality of payments over time (generally constituting 35% of score), the amounts you currently owe (30%), the length of your credit history (15%), how frequently you apply for new credit (10%), and the types of credit you are using (10%). Under certain circumstances, these factors may be weighted differently; for example, for a newer borrower without much credit history, the other four considerations increase in significance.</p>
<p>Making payments on time often gets touted as the most important factor in determining your score. For most people, this is technically true, with payment history clocking in at 35% of your score calculation. But at 30%, your “utilized credit”—how much you owe in comparison to your available credit—isn’t far behind. It’s important to remember that all five factors affect your score and to be savvy about how to improve in each category.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake #2: You carry high balances.</strong></h2>
<p>It’s important to keep your utilized credit low at any given time—even if you make payments on time <i>and</i> even if you regularly pay off balances in full. <a href="https://www.myfico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FICO® explains</a>, “When a high percentage of a person&#8217;s available credit is being used, this can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to make late or missed payments.” Revolving credit, such as credit cards, comes under particular scrutiny by FICO®. If, for example, you have a large number of cards carrying a balance, or you are close to maxing out cards, this may hurt your score.</p>
<p>Other factors to keep in mind: the mix of types of credit lines (e.g., revolving credit, installment loans, mortgage) you have open—and carry balances on—matters, as does whether you still owe a large amount of a loan’s initial installment.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake #3: You close long-term credit lines or frequently open new ones. </strong></h2>
<p>Closing a <a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/line-of-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit line</a>, especially if you’ve been conscientious about payments and low balance on that line, can harm your score. Once a credit line is closed, it no longer adds to your history. Closing a credit line you’ve had for ten years essentially erases a decade of your credit history. Even if you have paid off your debt on that line, or if don’t often use it, keep it open to maintain that history.</p>
<p>Frequently opening (or applying for) credit is another red flag for FICO®, which views this behavior as an indicator of a <a href="https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-reports/credit-checks-and-inquiries">risky</a> borrower: “Statistically, people with six inquiries or more on their credit reports can be up to eight times more likely to declare bankruptcy than people with no inquiries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don’t open credit accounts without first carefully considering the pros and cons of adding another line of credit to your load. When looking for the lowest rate for a mortgage, auto loan, or student loan, however, you can shop around as much as you like within 30 days, as FICO® allows this grace period for rate comparison.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake #4: You co-sign loans for loved ones.</strong></h2>
<p>Co-signing loans can jeopardize <i>your</i> credit. Co-signing means that both parties—you and partner—are equally responsible for payments for the life of the loan and for paying off the debt. If your loved one is late making payments, doesn’t make them at all, or defaults on the loan, your credit score will be damaged. Once your credit is linked with someone else’s, it is extremely difficult to detangle.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake #5: You don’t monitor your credit.</strong></h2>
<p>Check your score with all three credit bureaus (<a href="http://www.equifax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equifax</a>®, <a href="http://www.transunion.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TransUnion</a>®, and <a href="http://www.experian.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian</a>®) on a regular, frequent basis. This will help you catch errors or identity theft immediately before they can cause significant damage to your score. Credit bureaus are obligated to investigate any error or questionable transaction you find, typically within 30 days. Report inaccuracies to the bureau—with documentation of the problem— and let your lender know you are disputing the issue. It’s important that you consistently check your score from all three bureaus, as their reports may contain slightly different information (and different inaccuracies).</p>
<p>It’s also smart to check that lenders are reporting your most recent credit limits. Meghan Rabbitt of LearnVest.com writes, “While companies always report your debt, they may not be consistently updating your maximum available credit limits.” If your limits increase and your balances don’t, your percentage of utilized credit will go down and your score will improve. Make sure that lenders keep your limits up-to-date with the bureaus.</p>
<p>One last thing to regularly check: if you <i>have</i> co-signed credit with someone, their missed or late payments will appear on your credit report.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FICO® itself</a>, your bank or credit card provider, and free credit monitoring companies (such as <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Credit Karma</a>) are just a few of many options to help you keep a close eye on your credit score.</p>
<h2><strong>Mistake #6: You use your personal credit to fund your business.</strong></h2>
<p>Using your personal credit for business expenses is tempting, especially if your personal score is high and you have a long individual credit history. However, this greatly increases your risk of overloading your personal credit and damaging both your own credit and your business’s finances. It also doesn’t help you establish borrowing history for your business. Finally, using personal credit for business costs limits available credit to the range for individuals—a small percentage of what a lender might offer a business. The good news is that there some small business lenders, like <a href="http://www.fundbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a>, don’t require a credit check, so you don’t have to worry about making this mistake!</p>
<p>Understanding factors lowering your personal credit score and taking steps to rectify them will open more doors for your small business’s borrowing needs.</p>

The competition for top talent is high, and employers need to step up their game if they want to woo great candidates to work at their companies. Some companies take trendy routes, focusing on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/positive-company-culture">company culture</a></span> by offering free snacks and dog-friendly offices. Others try to entice prospects through work-from-home opportunities and other remote working incentives.</p>
<p>But these perks don’t solve the biggest issue with hiring today: <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/">finding great employees</a> and job candidates in the first place. The real race for talent has to begin with sourcing the best prospects you can find.</p>
<p>This means getting a leg up on your competition when it comes to recruiting. Building creative ways to find great employees can be a challenge, but here are five surefire tactics that can help you attract the right kind of employees to strengthen your business.</p>
<h2>Scope Out the Competition</h2>
<p>A competitive job market means that employees have a little leverage over their employers. In the current job market, around <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2018/07/01/half-of-u-s-employees-are-actively-searching-for-a-new-job/#59657bf179c6">half of all employees</a></span> are seeking out their next career challenge. Economic conditions make it appealing for many to look for a new job, especially if they’ve waited out the global recession at a low-paying job, or one for which they are overqualified.</p>
<p>A buyer’s market means that companies have to get creative to retain their talent. Those that choose not to retain their talent through raises, bonuses, or other perks may find their employees poached by other companies.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to cold contact prospects who have the skills you’re looking for. The odds of having a conversation are in your favor if half of the country’s workforce is actively seeking employment elsewhere. With a good sales pitch and an attractive offer, you might be able to convince your competition’s top talent to join your team.</p>
<h2>Look For Industry Influencers</h2>
<p>Social media platforms like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a></span> aren’t only great for messaging potential employees. They also offer you an opportunity to see who is leading conversations about your industry, and who the most active voices are within these conversations. The more someone participates in online discussions, the more prominent they become on social media. Algorithms tend to reward active users, which means that you might be able to snag an influential employee that helps set your business apart.</p>
<p>Even if industry thought leaders aren’t ready to make the plunge into a new career opportunity, they’re likely to be great amplifiers for your job postings. Better yet, they may also be willing to refer candidates over to you from their broader social network. It can’t hurt to enlist others to help you do the recruiting legwork for you, especially as it provides these influencers with an additional amount of clout within their industry.</p>
<h2>Lean on Employee Referrals</h2>
<p>Your employees are your best resource—not just because of the value they bring to your business, but also because they can offer you great leads on job candidates.</p>
<p>Employee referrals tend to provide more qualified candidates because they’re personally vetted by current staff members who put their reputation on the line by referring them. According to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/employee-referrals-remains-top-source-hires.aspx">Society for Human Resource Management</a></span>, 30 percent of all hires come from employee referrals, which means that you should reach out to your staff for recommendations if you haven’t done so already.</p>
<p>To kickstart your employee referral efforts, offer incentives to your staff for any employee they bring on board. This could take the form of a bonus or financial reward, although non-monetary perks such as additional days off or other fringe benefits may do the trick if money isn’t an option.</p>
<h2>Reach Out to Your Alumni Network</h2>
<p>Don’t overlook the value of your college alumni network for finding great talent. If your school’s network is particularly strong, you might be able to use it as a steady pipeline for job candidates. This tactic is particularly useful if you’re hiring for entry-level or early-career positions. Most new college graduates are looking for any open door they can find, and tapping into an alumni network helps you get seen in ways that other platforms can’t provide.</p>
<p>College alumni networks are only the start. Tap into your former employee networks (often called alumni networks as well) to solicit referrals. Even though your ex-employees no longer work for your business, they’re likely to recommend the company to friends and colleagues if they left on amicable terms.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an existing employee alumni network, consider building one for the future. This can pay off in the long-term as you look to hire more staff in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Tailor Your Job Posts to Each Network</h2>
<p>Every hiring platform attracts a different clientele. LinkedIn users differ in demographics and career interests than those on AngelList. Tailoring your job posts to resonate with each career site’s core audience can help you attract a wider pool of candidates.</p>
<p>Consider tapping into networks you hadn’t thought before. Looking for millennial talent? Instagram Stories or Snapchat can be a great way to appeal to a younger generation. Post your open jobs on your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/successful-social-media-strategy">social media platforms</a></span> and encourage your customers to share any good candidates they may have.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
The most beneficial thing you can do when trying to find great employees is to be adventurous. Don’t shy away from trying new tactics, leaning on unconventional resources, and experimenting with your methods. You’ll find that there might be new approaches that yield better results than the tried-and-true techniques you’ve used in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="531" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_311333582-768x531.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Busy smiling female business owner at work" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_311333582-768x531.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_311333582.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Your credit utilization ratio is an extremely important part of your credit score.  This tells lenders—or anyone else looking at your credit score—what percentage of your total available credit line you’ve used at any given moment.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a $100,000 line of credit, and you’ve spent $70,000 against it, your utilization ratio is 70%. That’s a high percentage, so that’s not a number that’s high-credit-score friendly.</p>
<p>Although different credit bureaus factor your credit utilization ratio into their score algorithm differently, the bottom line is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://time.com/money/collection-post/2791957/what-is-my-credit-score/">that the ratio affects your credit score number</a></span>. Ideally, you’d like to keep your ratio below 30%. If you need to lower your credit utilization in order to get a higher score to apply for business financing, for instance, there are some strategies you can take advantage of to get that number down.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve written before on strategies for improving your credit, but in this article, we&#8217;ll focus on credit utilization in particular. Here are five ways to lower your credit utilization ratio.</p>
<h2>1. Schedule credit payments more often.</h2>
<p>Considering your credit utilization ratio is just that—a ratio—it’s up to you to bring that number down. If you are able, consider paying off your outstanding debts, such as business credit card bills, more than once a month.</p>
<p>If at all possible, you should already have your bills on autopay so you never miss a payment. For the months when your spending is higher than usual, nip that total in the bud so you’re not carrying such a high balance the entire month.</p>
<h2>2. Transfer balances to 0% APR credit cards.</h2>
<p>If you’re carrying a balance on your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-ways-business-credit-card-can-help-improve-credit/">business credit cards</a>, your interest means more money. That interest adds up, driving up your credit utilization ratio.</p>
<p>This actually harms you two ways. Not only does your balance end up costing you cash, but it also might end up costing you a higher credit score. In that case, consider applying for a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-cards/0-apr"> 0% intro APR business credit card</a></span>, many of which will allow you to transfer your balance. These cards have an interest-free introductory period, which means you can carry a balance on your card without paying anything extra for a predetermined period.</p>
<p>By transferring some or all of your balances to a new card, you can lower your overall average credit utilization across cards.</p>
<h2>3. Keep your cards open.</h2>
<p>Not using a credit card? Consider keeping it open anyway. It could actually help your credit utilization ratio.</p>
<p>The available credit line on all of the credit cards in your name comprises the total amount of credit you have to available to use. If you close a card, that total amount goes down. That means even if you don’t change your spending, your ratio goes up (which is the thing you will want to avoid).</p>
<p>Before you think about trying to reverse engineer this concept by applying for another card to increase your available credit, remember that any time you apply for any line of credit, your credit score gets a temporary ding because of the hard credit inquiry. This is also called a “hard pull” of your credit. Too many hard pulls can lower your credit score, and if you get rejected, this could also bring your score down.</p>
<h2>4. Know when your lenders report to the credit bureaus.</h2>
<p>Of course, you’ll have to make big purchases here and there. And it’s great that you have a credit card to do this! If you are spending a lot, having a sense of when your lenders report to the credit bureaus (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">generally once a month</span>) will enable you to be strategic.</p>
<p>With this date, you can schedule payments before they report, or not make those big purchases right before your score is reported. Both of these can lower the ratio that your credit bureaus receive. You can simply ask your creditors to find out the date.</p>
<h2>5. Get a better handle on your spending.</h2>
<p>In general, the smartest thing you can do to lower your credit utilization ratio is to really have a sense of the details of your financial life. Knowing when your lenders report is one piece, but the other is simply understanding what your credit limit is and knowing how close you are to it with each purchase you make. The best thing about this piece of your credit score is that you have control over it. Part of getting down this number is staying in the loop with your spending and your payments.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a business owner (and an individual, too) there’s a lot you can do with a higher credit score: Get a more favorable business loan, get approved for business credit cards that better benefit your business, get a mortgage, and have the leverage to negotiate on things like overdue payments. It’s important to do the work to improve your credit utilization ratio if you know it’s a place that you can do better. In most cases, it’s possible.</p>

The downturn began over a decade ago, but it’s only within the last few years that the economy has come fully back to life—albeit less so for certain communities, particularly those in rural areas.</p>
<p>But to see how the Great Recession continues to affect us today, just look at the way millennials—America’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force/">largest generation</a></span> in the U.S. labor force, with some well into their 30s—approach the concept of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is one of the foundations of the American economy, if not a central part of the collective American psyche. And yet, according to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/2019-millennial-entrepreneurs-money-report">2019 Millennial Entrepreneurs and Money Report</a></span> from the team at Fundera, rates of entrepreneurship for those born in the 1980s and early 1990s is well below other generations, including now retirement-age Baby Boomers.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Only </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://www.kauffman.org/currents/2016/07/age-and-entrepreneurship">.22% of millennials start new businesses</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> in any given month, compared to .37% of baby boomers. And when baby boomers were younger, they were more likely to become entrepreneurs than millennials are today.</span></p>
<p>Millennials are lagging behind older generations in terms of their willingness to start a business, and even trail post-millennials in terms of business revenue and much of it has to do with coming of age during the economy’s greatest contraction in the post-World War II era.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Millennials have lower personal credit scores than previous generations</span></h2>
<p>The average personal credit score for millennials is 699—more than 20 points lower than that of Baby Boomers. This may be due to the fact that millennials carry, on average, just as much debt as older generations do, despite having had less time to rack up that debt. The greatest source of millennial debt? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://news.northwesternmutual.com/planning-and-progress-2018">Education loans</a></span>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10208" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10208" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-credit-scores.png" alt="Millennial entrepreneurs’ business credit scores average 38 points higher than Generation X and 23 points higher than baby boomers. Chart via Fundera." width="500" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-credit-scores.png 859w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-credit-scores-768x614.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10208" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Millennial entrepreneurs’ business credit scores average 38 points higher than Generation X and 23 points higher than baby boomers. Source: Fundera</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Personal credit scores play a major role in a person’s ability to acquire affordable financing to start or grow a business. Without that access to capital, millennials are likely reticent to take on the risk of starting their own business.</p>
<p>And although some millennials are undoubtedly unwise with their money—as are we all—evidence points to them actually being more astute financial planners than previous generations: Their business credit scores are markedly higher than those of people from Generation X (whom they beat by almost 40 points) and Baby Boomers (23 points).</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Millennials’ “do-it-myself” mentality may not lend itself to entrepreneurship </span></h2>
<p>According to a recent <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/Merrill_Edge_Report_Fall_2017.pdf">Merrill Edge report</a></span>, millennials tend to want to take their financial matters into their own hands, not relying on others as they pursue financial independence.</p>
<p>You might think that wanting to “DIY” everything would make millennials more interested in starting their own businesses, not less. But their concern with long-term financial stability makes them less likely to take on the risk and debt that a startup loan—be it from a bank, online lender, or even friends and family—would require.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Millennials are taking conservative approaches with their finances</span></h2>
<p>Undoubtedly scarred by seeing how risk can backfire after the bubbles burst in 2007 and 2008, millennials are taking slow, deliberate approaches to building up both their personal finances and their businesses.</p>
<p>According to the Millennial Report, millennials’ businesses are being outperformed from a revenue standpoint by businesses from every other generation, including post-millennials. That’s because many millennials have been on an uphill climb since they graduated from school, and as a result they are more conservative and tend to “play it safe.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_10209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10209" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10209" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-recession-memories.png" alt="When it comes to business revenues, millennials are not at the top of the pack. Chart from Fundera" width="500" height="378" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-recession-memories.png 1009w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-recession-memories-768x581.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10209" class="wp-caption-text"><em>When it comes to business revenues, millennials are not at the top of the pack. Source: Fundera</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">research shows</span> that the majority of entrepreneurs who get started during an economic depression are “qualitatively disadvantaged,” leading to an overall decrease in qualitative entrepreneurship.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Millennials prefer traditional financing, but they receive less of it</span></h2>
<p>In keeping with their more conservative approach to business, millennials generally prefer to use traditional financing, such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans">business term loans</a></span> or <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/">lines of credit</a>, to tools like <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/">business credit cards</a>.</p>
<p>Millennials, however, tend to receive less financing than other generations—$8,515 less than Baby Boomers, on average. Whether that’s because millennials had lower personal credit scores, less upfront capital, and fewer assets to use as collateral, or simply needed less financing for their ventures isn’t clear.</p>
<p>While millennials aren’t paying outsized premiums for that financing, the fact of the matter is they have less to work with than any generation before them.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10210" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10210" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fundera-report-types-of-financing.png" alt="Among millennial business owners who received funding from Fundera in the last year, here’s the breakdown of the products they received.

Source: Fundera.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Recession was a financially traumatic event for wide swaths of the American public, across all generations. Some people lost their businesses, others lost their personal savings, and some lost everything. At that point, millennials, many of whom were still coming of age or in school, had less to lose.</p>
<p>Now that the stock market and economy at-large has mostly recovered, however, it appears that millennials lost things that they may never gain back. The recession hit at a crucial time for building personal credit, capital, and opportunity—and millennials may spend the rest of their lives playing catch up. The fact that so many are choosing the security of salaried positions over the risk of starting a business should come as little surprise.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs that do emerge from this generation are more resilient and assured than they have any right to be, and our report shows exactly why. We look forward to checking back with them in a few years to see which of these trends are temporary dips, and which trends are—for better or for worse—for life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="513" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_785493346-768x513.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_785493346-768x513.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_785493346.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>As the end of the calendar year approaches, small business owners know that their financial year is almost up as well. For most small businesses, the financial year is up on 12/31—which means a fresh, new start is ahead.</p>
<p>Although good businesses will have a handle on the state of their finances throughout the year, the end of the year is typically when companies double down on their efforts to clean up their books, to present an organized state of affairs to the IRS, banks, lenders, and investors—as well as for their own peace of mind.</p>
<p>If you run a new or very small business, you might be the one in charge of making sure you follow generally accepted accounting practices and keeping your company on the right financial track. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountant-can-business-cant/">Hiring an accountant</a></span> can take a lot of the difficult bookkeeping and financial planning responsibilities off your plate, but it may not be feasible for you at this point.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, here’s a rundown of seven ways to clean up your financials before the new year:</p>
<h2>Create a checklist of important documents to have on hand</h2>
<p>The first step in getting cleaned up is ensuring that you have every important financial document regarding your business dealings from the past year (and all past years) close at hand.</p>
<p>A good baseline checklist to use is what the IRS asks for when auditing a business. The IRS can audit you at any time by random selection, so it’s helpful to prepare for this scenario anyway.</p>
<p>Among other documents, here are some things the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/audits-records-request">IRS typically requests</a></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receipts, bills, and cancelled checks</li>
<li>Any legal papers relating to your business</li>
<li>Loan agreements, including a copy of the original loan</li>
<li>Logs or diaries that may recount your travel plans or job-hunting activities</li>
<li>Tickets, such as travel tickets or even lottery tickets</li>
<li>Theft or loss documents</li>
<li>Schedule K-1, if you’ve got an S Corporation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ensure your inventory and asset records align with reality</h2>
<p>Over the course of a year, your stated inventory and fixed asset levels on the books may deviate from what you really have on hand. This is especially likely if you use a manual process to track your assets, rather than an automated system.</p>
<p>Fixed assets, which are large investments that you plan to keep on your balance sheet for years, can be particularly troublesome. Fixed assets that you have on your books but don’t appear in real life (due to loss, theft, or breakdowns) are called “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.waspbarcode.com/buzz/ghost-assets-why-should-you-care/">ghost assets</a></span>.” These ghosts mess with workflow and can trigger an audit from the IRS since your reported worth is higher than it should be.</p>
<p>Take the time to audit and account for all of your assets at the end of the year, so your filings are truthful. This will help you both logistically and legally.</p>
<h2>Reconcile your bank and credit card statements</h2>
<p>Do the balances on your statements match up to what you have listed on your own balance sheet? The only way to find out is to compare them. Review the ending balance on your bank statement, subtracting any outstanding checks but adding deposits on their way to you. This amount should match the cash account balance on your balance sheet.</p>
<p>Also, check to see that everything on your credit card statements is present and accounted for on your books as well as in your office. Any incorrect or fraudulent charges should be addressed immediately.</p>
<h2>Collect on accounts receivable, deliver on accounts payable</h2>
<p>Generally accepted accounting principles (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gaap.asp">GAAP</a></span>) dictate that if you charge someone for your product or service, you should collect payment for that work the same year. Some businesses fudge the numbers and fail to collect until January, so they won’t have to pay taxes on the payment until the following year. This is generally frowned upon, especially by institutions that want a clear picture of your business, such as lenders for most <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans">business loans</a></span>.</p>
<p>Instead, be diligent and collect on your invoices before the year is up. Void and reissue checks that you’ve sent out to those that have invoiced you to ensure they’re cashed. Make sure to get your cash flow in line and up-to-date in order to present a truthful snapshot of how business is going.</p>
<h2>Button up all your accounts, transactions, and expenses</h2>
<p>The end of the year is a great time to close out old or inactive accounts for customers, vendors, and employees from whom you’ve moved on. Ensure your transactions line up on both your tax returns and on your internal books. And check that all your gross sales, sales taxes, and merchant fees are either accounted for or paid up.</p>
<h2>Review your profit-and-loss statement</h2>
<p>Your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/profit-and-loss-statement">P&amp;L statement</a></span> provides you with the net income of your business by summarizing your revenues, costs, and expenses. It should also categorize your expenses to help keep them organized.</p>
<p>Generate a profit-and-loss statement and review both month-by-month levels to spot major fluctuations, and individual transactions—names, dates, and amounts—to see if you can identify why some months may be markedly lower than others. A transaction may have been miscategorized, duplicated, or not posted altogether, and now is the time to fix that.</p>
<h2>Prepare for your payroll responsibilities</h2>
<p>If you had salaried employees this year, you’re required by law to send them their W-2 no later than January 31 of the following year. Doing so will keep you federally compliant, and will keep your employees happy.</p>
<p>If you used vendors or freelancers this year and paid them more than $600 apiece, you’re going to need to send out a 1099 form. It’s crucial that you ask for and receive W-9s so you can prepare to generate and complete 1099s by the first month of next year as well.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Even if you prepare and execute all of these steps yourself, it may still pay to get in touch with a CPA and let them review your work to ensure compliance. There’s a thin line between window dressing and legally or ethically dubious practices, and your clean up efforts may end up making your books dirtier if you’re not careful.</p>

There are many reasons a lender may turn down your loan application, but there’s one reason you may not expect: fraud.</p>
<p>The good news? It’s not impossible to find business financing, especially with a little bit of extra work and research. The bad news? It will be a little harder than it would be without the blemish on your record.</p>
<p>According to a study done in 2014, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.acfe.com/rttn/docs/2014-report-to-nations.pdf">whopping 66 percent</a></span> of small businesses are victims each year and the typical affected organization loses about 5 percent of their annual revenue to fraud. And some business owners don’t even discover it until they run their credit report. Business identity theft could happen to any size business, and since small businesses don’t tend to have sophisticated security systems, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/business-identity-theft">they’re often even more vulnerable</a></span>.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about fraud affecting your business financing application, here are a few tips.</p>
<h2>First, do your best to avoid fraud in the first place</h2>
<p>Of course, the easiest way to ensure fraud doesn’t tank your loan application is to take steps to prevent it in the first place. While falling victim to business fraud can’t be entirely avoided, there are a few things you can do to monitor your credit and protect yourself.</p>
<h3>Monitor your credit</h3>
<p>Even if you’re not currently in the market for business financing, it’s a good idea to set up credit monitoring services. Programs such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.nav.com/">Nav</a></span> will actively monitor both your personal and business credit for new accounts or suspicious activity and send you an instant notification if anything looks amiss.</p>
<h3>Be careful about the details you share</h3>
<p>Phishing, both through email and text, is one of the most common tricks used to score personal data from businesses. If you receive a text with an unfamiliar phone number or link—especially one that asks you to update your information—<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2017/03/30/5-easy-steps-to-help-avoid-fraud-and-identity-theft/#42bbe7a5112a">don&#8217;t share any personal information. </a></span>The sender may be creating malware to gain access into your phone.</p>
<h3>Skip the free public WiFi</h3>
<p>It may be tempting to sign into that public WiFi, but most public networks don’t offer much security on mobile apps, so it’s much easier to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0014-tips-using-public-wi-fi-networks#Mobile">steal your private info this way</a></span>. If you do decide to use a public WiFi system, never do your online banking when connected—wait until you’re on a secure and private network.</p>
<h2>How will fraud affect your business loan application?</h2>
<p>Credit card issuers and credit reporting agencies are constantly monitoring your credit for suspicious activity. When something admiss shows up, credit agencies will issue a fraud alert to your credit report. This is Transunion, Experian, or Equifax telling lenders to be careful because the person applying for a new account might not be you.</p>
<p>If you’ve been a victim of fraud, you can also set up your own fraud alert. This is a way of telling the credit agencies and lenders to double check that the person applying for financing is actually you.</p>
<h3>A slower process</h3>
<p>When there is a fraud alert on your account, lenders are required to take extra steps to verify your loan application which can drastically slow <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/fraud-alert-may-slow-loan-approval-but-shouldnt-prevent-it/">down the approval process</a></span>. In some cases, a fraud alert could prevent you from prequalifying for certain loan products. Though a fraud alert usually won’t bar you from getting loan approval overall, it’ll definitely make the process longer and more drawn out.</p>
<p>If you were the one to add a fraud alert to your account, you’re probably already prepared for the slowdown. Though it’s an extra step, it’s worth it to avoid additional red marks on your credit report. But what happens when you intentionally apply for a loan—only to have a lender deny it due to fraud concerns?</p>
<h3>Remove a fraud alert</h3>
<p>Whether you were the one to add the fraud alert or your (valid) application triggered an incorrect alert, you’ll want to reach out to the credit agencies and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/removing-a-fraud-alert-from-your-credit-report/">ask them, in writing</a></span>, to remove it from your account. Of course, you want to be completely sure that nothing fishy is going on with your accounts, especially if you’ve been a victim of fraud in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Fraud is a real concern when it comes to business financing. Not only can undetected fraud sink your credit score and make it incredibly difficult to land a loan, but a fraud alert will also slow down the entire process. If you have a fraud alert on your account, it’ll take a few extra steps and a bit more caution to land that loan—but it’s not impossible.</p>

Unfortunately for many small business owners, the business loan process can end up being a roadblock to success.</p>
<p>According to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2015/Report-SBCS-2015.pdf">2015 small business credit survey</a></span> by the Federal Reserve, only 50% of financing applicants were approved for the full amount for which they applied. This means that half of small business owners <em>didn’t</em> receive the funding they needed to grow or maintain their business.</p>
<p>These numbers may sound dismal, but if you are a small business owner in need of a business loan, don’t lose hope. An insufficient application and lack of preparedness are two of the major reasons why loan applications are denied. But there are simple steps that you can take to prepare for the business loan process and help it run more smoothly.</p>
<p>Follow these expert tips to put your best foot forward when it comes to applying for a small business loan.</p>
<h2>Things to know about business loans</h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What kind of loan you need</span>: there are many loan options available to small business owners today. More choice is always a good thing when it comes to finding business funding, but it can be difficult to figure out which loan is right for you. Fortunately, there are resources such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/business-loan-application">this simple quiz</a></span> to point you in the right direction.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What you will use the loan for</span>: lenders will want to know your specific plan for the implementation of your new funds. Whether you are hiring more employees, expanding to another location, getting new equipment, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/inventory-financing">purchasing inventory</a></span>, you should know exactly what the money is going to accomplish.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">How much capital you need</span>: just as it’s important not to ask for too little, it’s important not to ask for too much. Lenders expect a return on their investment (you), and if your requested loan amount is falling too far on either end of the spectrum, your application will come across as ill-prepared or naïve. Either on your own or with an accountant, forecast your revenue and profit quarterly to predict how much funding you’ll need and when.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">You have capacity to pay back the loan</span>: both you and your lender should be confident that you can realistically pay back your loan. If you can prove this in your application, you have a much better chance of being approved for your desired loan. Because you know how much you are asking for and what you are using the money for, you should be able to forecast your return on investment and predict when you’ll be able to pay back your loan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Things to prepare ahead of time</h2>
<p>The biggest key to having a smooth and successful business loan process is to have detailed information about your business prepared. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2017/03/22/10-key-steps-to-getting-a-small-business-loan/#12ecd0a340f6">list of documents required</a></span> for a business loan application is a long one, and not every document will be required for every type of loan, but we’ll do our best to summarize it here:</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Proof of legitimate business</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Business License</span>: your basic business registration or other industry-specific licensing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proof of Ownership</span>: if your business has multiple owners, you’ll need written permission from your partner to apply for a loan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Plan</span>: not always required, but will help prove your seriousness about your business and obtaining a loan.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Proof of customer base</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customer List</span>: proof of customers including names, contact information, and amounts invoiced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accounts Receivables Aging Statement</span>: proves your business’s cash flow and shows how quickly your customers pay you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credit Card Processing Statements</span>: for retail, this is solid evidence of your sales volume.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Proof of financial health</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Tax Returns</span>: 2-3 years’ business tax returns will show your long-term revenue history.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Profit and Loss Statements</span>: 2 years’ statements to show your business’s revenue and expenses.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Business Banking Statements</span>: at least 4 months and 12 months if your business is seasonal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Forecast</span>: if your business is too new for tax returns and statements, provide a researched sales forecast.</p>
<h2>Things to double-check before you proceed</h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your business credit score</span>: business owners who understand their business credit scores are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.nav.com/insights/">41% more likely to be approved for loans</a></span>. Be sure to know and understand yours.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Your online presence</span>: many <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/borrowers-hit-socialmedia-hurdles-1389224469?tesla=y">small business loan lenders are now looking at applicants’ social media accounts</a></span> and online presence. Be sure to double-check yours for professionalism.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The fine print</span>: before you take on any kind of business loan, be sure to double-check the fine print so that you are aware of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredhecht/2017/10/30/9-little-known-business-loan-fees-hidden-in-the-fine-print/#79668206457d">any hidden costs</a></span>, such as application fees.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Get approved for the best loan you can get</h2>
<p>If being approved for a small business loan is a hurdle, the real challenge is preparing for the jump. Fortunately, if you follow these expert tips you&#8217;ll be bringing your A-game to the business loan application process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_723294832-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Smart ways to invest in your business" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_723294832-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_723294832.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>When bills are piling up and expenses seem endless, the idea of spending money on something potentially non-essential might seem, well, insane. But as a small business owner, you have to be thinking about the investments that’ll make your business grow, too—otherwise you might not have a future at all.</p>
<p>When you’re sizing up investments to set up your business for success, remember that smart investments will almost always get you further than simply popular or <span style="font-style: italic;">big </span>ones. These key investments that make real sense for small businesses. By using your cash on hand, or some help from <a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans">small business financing</a>, you can spend on these ideas to help you grow.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hiring a Consultant</span></h2>
<p>By your very nature as a  business owner, you’re passionate about area of expertise. If you&#8217;re a CPA, you’re used to everyone knocking on your door come tax time. If you create bespoke furniture, you know which vendors offer the best rates on lumber. But what if the idea of content marketing makes you sweat? Or your business website looks too outdated to attract the right customers? Sometimes, you might not know what you don’t know—and the best solution is to reach out to subject-matter experts.</p>
<p>Meeting with an independent consultant about your specific business needs can help you grow and save you money in the long run. There are HR consultants who handle internal employee disputes, digital marketers who can take your business’s growth to the next level, and many more. Consultants often work on both project-based and hourly-rate payment plans, depending on their business models and your needs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning on working with a number of consultants for a large project, it might make sense to look into a <a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans">loan for your business</a> or a <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/">line of credit</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spending on Digital Tools</span></h2>
<p>So, you&#8217;ve recently launched (or relaunched) your website—and it&#8217;s perfect. The visuals are exactly what you envisioned, and your product images are stunning. Many site-building platforms offer basic analytics tools (such as the number of visitors and most popular pages). But more detailed insights—for example, the time your customers spent considering a specific product, or the path they travel throughout your site—aren’t always included. With a more sophisticated digital tool suite for business, companies can create custom dashboards with the most relevant information about their sites.</p>
<p>Beyond your internal site, you can also invest in more sophisticated platforms are also available to help understand your social media reach. Platforms such as <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> or <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a> not only allow you to schedule posts across your company&#8217;s accounts, but they also provide real-time analytics about your followers.</p>
<p>Although free versions of these services are available, monthly paid subscriptions often offer improved features and excellent customer service. Learning about your customers and their behaviors is worth the money.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Networking, Both Online and Off</span></h2>
<p>In business, what you know <span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>who you know both help immensely. Connections often lead to referrals, new clients, potential hires, and even lucrative work orders. Curating your network with smart connections is important whether you&#8217;re just starting your business or you&#8217;ve been at it for years.</p>
<p>Industry conferences and networking events are a great way to meet other business owners in a laid back, friendly setting. And there’s a lot more to these events than schmoozing alone. Inspiring panels with leaders in your industry and conferences that allow you to dig even deeper into event sponsorship programs can both deepen your knowledge of your field. Maybe even inspire you to take a leap of faith on your next business idea.</p>
<p>Conference tickets can range in price from free to thousands of dollars, so do some research and poll your network about their favorite events before you put a dent in your wallet—you want to make sure you’re investing in the right places. And don’t forget: Networking isn’t just about meeting connections face-to-face. Virtual conferences, held online throughout the year, can be a great networking tool as well.</p>
<p>And while you can build your online network for free on LinkedIn, the platform offers a number of paid subscriptions that can create sales leads, give you access to tutorials and business insights, and help you recruit new talent.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expanding to a Second Location </span></h2>
<p>After months—maybe even years—of planning and dreaming, you&#8217;ve finally opened a storefront. And great news: Business is booming. It might be time to consider opening an additional location.</p>
<p>Expanding your business could help you reach new customers. But just as you did before you opened your first location, you&#8217;ll need to do your research. We’ll be the first to say that investing in a second brick-and-mortar isn’t for everyone—and in fact, it could be a very costly mistake if you’re not careful. So, you’ll need to determine whether this investment is a smart one for you—because if it is, it could pay off in a big way.</p>
<p>Ask yourself a few key questions, such whether the the market is fit for another location, how steady your current cash flow is, and whether you’re good at delegating and managing from afar. Then, if also you run the numbers and decide that a new storefront is the right move for your business’s growth, you might need to consider either looking for an investor or seeing out business funding. Whether you decide to approach business lenders, start a crowdfunding campaign, or approach private investors, prep your business case and round up your financial documents to prove that your new venture is a sound investment.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smart Business Investments Now Can Lead to Big Dividends Later</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Any investment decision can be nerve wracking, but the stakes are especially high when your small business is at the center of things. You’ll see, though, that the right investments are well worth the money, even if the return takes months—or even years. As you continue to grow, you’ll find yourself with a host of investment opportunities that’ll eventually lead to more sales and more revenue.</p>

But now, your company is, well, <span style="font-style: italic;">a company</span>. Is it time for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-cards">business credit card</a></span>? Chances are that whether you’re in startup stage, or a full-blown functional business, you need a business credit card in your wallet.</p>
<p>Here’s why that personal credit card might not cut it any longer—and exactly how to tell.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Choose a Business Credit Card Over a Personal Card?</span></h2>
<p>It’s a totally reasonable question. After all, business credit cards function just like a personal credit card. The issuer gives you a credit limit; you can make purchases, balance transfers, and even cash withdrawals. And, if you pay back the amount you’ve borrowed, your limit replenishes. Plus, you can get benefits and rewards from both, like cash back, miles, and points.</p>
<p>The key differences, though, between <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/business-vs-personal-credit-cards">personal vs. business credit cards</a></span> are significant enough that they could change the way your business spends. These are four of the major benefits that might lead you to choose a business credit card:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">They’re </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">designed for businesses</span>. That means rewards and other perks are geared toward benefiting companies. For instance, a business credit card might offer extra cash back on office-supply expenses.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Their </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">limits are </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">often</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> higher</span>. That could be great news for you—especially because companies generally spend more than individuals. It’s very possible that the limit on your personal card will be too low to meet an emergency business expense or stay at a good credit utilization ratio (usually considered 30% or below).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can use them to</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">build</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> business credit</span>. You have a business credit score—and that’s different than your personal credit score. You can build your business credit at the big three <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.score.org/resource/understanding-three-major-business-credit-bureaus">business credit bureaus</a></span>—Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax—with a business credit card. And, probably unsurprisingly, a better business credit score will lead to better business loan options, too.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">They help you protect your personal liability. </span>It’s important to draw a distinct line between your personal and business finances (aka spending for business on a business credit card). This is especially true from a liability standpoint. If you can’t pay your credit card bills, or, worse, your business is sued or you need to declare bankruptcy, your expenses must be separated so that your personal assets and credit are protected.</li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Know If You’re Ready for a Business Credit Card</span></h2>
<p>Now that you know <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> you should get a business credit card, here’s how to tell that you’re ready to get one. Any one of these reasons on its own is reason enough—and if you see yourself in more than one, then it’s definitely time to find the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-cards">best business credit card</a></span> for you:</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. You have good personal credit.</span></h2>
<p>If you’ve already proven that you’re responsible with your personal finances and borrowing, chances are you’ll also be able to responsibly use a business credit card. When you’re applying for your first business credit card, card issuers will check your personal credit score in order to figure out which business cards you’ll qualify for. If you’re still building or rebuilding credit, you do still have some business credit card options; or, you can also consider working on your personal credit with a secured personal credit card before applying for a business card.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. You need to build toward a loan&#8230;</span></h2>
<p>If you’re a startup or new company that doesn’t have enough time in business to qualify for a business loan, but do need some capital to get things rolling, a business credit card can really help. If used strategically, 0% introductory APR business credit cards can work like interest-free loans for their intro periods, giving you time to pay back large purchases. Plus, you’ll be building good business credit while you pay back your bills in full on time thereafter.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. &#8230;or graduate into a better one.</span></h2>
<p>If you didn’t get favorable business loan terms because of your credit score and you’d like to refinance your existing loan, or graduate into a better product, a business credit card can help. By paying off your bills in full and on time—on top of being diligent with your loan payments, of course—you can prove financial responsibility to your lender.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. You want to track or control employee or contractor spending.</span></h2>
<p>Most business credit cards give you the option to issue employee cards connected to the main cardholder account. But many also allow you to set spending limits on these employee cards—some even will let you restrict spending to only certain categories of products, dates and times, or remotely turn cards on and off. You don’t have to be paranoid about anyone running up thousands of dollars of debt of unapproved expenses on your card.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. You haven’t separated your business and personal finances yet.</span></h2>
<p>Not only does keeping your transactions separated make accounting and tax time easier, but it’s a <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>if you want all of the liability protection of that LLC or corporation you filed for. It’s as simple as setting up a business bank account and making sure you’re spending on a designated business credit card—otherwise, how does anyone know where your life stops and the business begins?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. You spend a lot but don’t earn anything for it.</span></h2>
<p>Running a business costs money. Whatever you <span style="font-style: italic;">have </span>to be spending on—supplies, inventory, utilities, gas, professional services—you might as well be earning rewards for, right? And since you can pick the rewards that benefit your business most, like hotel stays or statement credits, there’s no reason why you should be spending and not earning at the same time.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">7. You don’t have a good handle on your business spending.</span></h2>
<p>Tracking expenses is difficult enough—and if you’re not great with money, adding a credit card into the mix could be dangerous, sure. But a business credit card can help you figure out what kind of categories your business is spending on, how often, and during what seasons. If you pay with cash, you don’t have that kind of papertrail. By spotting patterns, you might be able to score bulk discounts longer-term contracts with vendors, or get a card that’ll reward you for certain spending categories, like entertaining or utilities.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">If It’s Time, Make Sure to Find the Best Credit Card for Your Business</span></h2>
<p>There are lots of reasons your business might be ready for a business credit card—and, luckily, many types of business credit cards to suit these needs. When you start looking into your options, explore all that there is to offer to make sure that you’re getting the card that works best for your business. It’s out there.</p>
