Smart investments that add value to a company are paramount to a company’s success, including revenue-building equipment financing purchases. According to the</span><a href="https://www.store.leasefoundation.org/cvweb/Portals/ELFA-LEASE/Documents/Products/ELFF.EconomicOutlook.2021Q2.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment Leasing and Financing Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2021’s resurgence in economic activity should make for “a banner year for equipment and software investment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re obtaining equipment for your startup or upgrading your growing office, it’s essential to define your equipment needs and research your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/equipments-loan-financing/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment financing options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, do you need equipment for the short-term, such as a specific project you’re currently working on? Or do you think the technology you rely on is changing so quickly that equipment leasing is your best option to keep up affordably?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps your needs are longer-term, and you view the equipment you need as something that adds value and has revenue-generating potential? If that’s the case, you may want to consider purchasing the machine (or machines) using equipment financing. In many cases, the investment is well worth the time and cost.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Is Business Equipment Financing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business lenders understand the financial challenges business owners face while trying to grow their businesses. Unfortunately, not all entrepreneurs have the working capital on hand or accessible to purchase the necessary equipment to get their businesses off the ground or to grow. Buying business equipment is a large part of the costs associated with running a business, whether you are financing a machine for your cutting-edge tech company, restaurant, or small manufacturing business. And, since most business owners don’t have access to enough capital to afford these costly purchases, the need to explore financing options is paramount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-to-use-equipment-loans-to-improve-your-small-business/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows small business owners to obtain the equipment and other machines needed without putting too much strain on the company’s cash flow. Like all small business loans, the business secures financing and then makes payments towards the loan over a predetermined period of time. How long you can finance equipment depends on the terms of the loan. Typically, equipment financing terms run from three to 10 years, although you may be able to secure longer-term loans for larger purchases. Then, once the loan is repaid, you own the equipment.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Hard Is It to Get an Equipment Loan?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although all equipment financing lenders have their own qualification criteria and application process, typically, you can expect to provide:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business’s credit score. (Not sure if you have a business credit score? It is crucial that you check with the top three credit bureaus—Experian, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and Equifax—to learn your score before applying for financing.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your personal credit score (especially if the company is new)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number of years in business</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A down payment (A down payment is not always needed, but a lender may ask for it.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial statements (Income statement and balance sheet)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most equipment financing lenders do not approve loans for startups; however, you may be able to find some lenders willing to lend money to new businesses. These offers often come with stricter terms, a bigger down payment requirement, and higher interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owners may also have to provide collateral as security for repayment of the loan, although, in many cases, the equipment being purchased can be enough collateral. Therefore, if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender assumes ownership of the equipment. In addition, the lender may require a personal guarantee from the borrower, which means the lender can also procure the borrower’s personal assets, such as their house, cars, and bank accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the lender asks you to provide a down payment, you can expect to put down between 10 to 30% of the purchase price. In some cases, the lender will finance the total cost of the equipment, again charging higher interest rates and offering tougher terms. As with most things, the devil is in the details, so it is crucial to read the fine print in the loan agreement. Get a fresh set of eyes on the documents from your attorney and accountant to make sure you are not misinterpreting anything that may put your business and personal assets at more risk than you are willing to undertake.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Do You Finance Equipment?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a business equipment financing lender is not as hard as you think. Most banks, alternative lenders, and equipment manufacturers offer equipment financing. The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7(a) loan program provides guarantees for equipment financing as well. However, finding a lender with the terms you desire is another story. Qualifications vary by lender, as do the interest rates and terms. For example, Bank of America requires a company to be in business for two years under the same ownership and have at least $250,000 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start researching lenders, make sure you have the backup documentation ready to go so there is no delay in the application process. You may not be asked for all this information, but it is smart to have it handy, just in case.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business information: Names of owners, company address, website, social security numbers, and Federal Tax ID number. If your company is incorporated or a Limited Liability Company (LLC), you may also be asked to supply your Certificate of Good Standing (available from the Secretary of State’s office in your state).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment information: Make sure to have a detailed description of the equipment you need financed and a quote for how much it will cost.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank statements: Most lenders want to see your company’s cash flow for at least three months.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business tax returns (1-3 years)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income statement (most recent)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balance sheet (most recent)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business license and/or certifications</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason for purchase. The lender may ask you what the purpose of the equipment is and how you expect the equipment to help increase sales.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra costs associated: Try and tie down the additional maintenance costs, service contracts, storage, parts, repairs, and insurance. The service provider should be able to give you this information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to hire a specialist to run the equipment, you should project their expected wages. The lender wants proof your company has done its due diligence before it will loan you any funds.</span></p>
<h3><b>Benefits of Equipment Financing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a small business, cash flow is everything. So, if you can obtain crucial business equipment without having to drain your bank account, it is definitely worth exploring. In addition, freeing up working capital allows your company to spend money in other parts of the business, such as hiring employees or expanding your marketing efforts. Here are some other advantages to equipment financing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit score and financial history. Usually, because the equipment can be used as collateral, the credit scores of the owners and business don’t have to be perfect. If traditional lenders like banks turn you down, look at fintech lenders like Fundbox. Fintech companies typically take on borrowers that banks will not fund.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less paperwork and faster processing times. While bank loan applications can take weeks or even months to be processed and approved or denied, alternative lenders offering equipment financing can get you an answer relatively quickly, and the fund disbursement is faster as well.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New business equipment is an asset on your company’s balance sheet. However, if you leased the equipment, the machine is not considered an asset because you do not own the machine.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax write-offs! Business equipment owned by the business can be claimed on the business’s tax return as a depreciation write-off. Depreciation measures the value of an asset over time as its ages from wear and tear. Business equipment qualifies for the write-off if used to generate income, and the equipment’s lifespan is expected to be more than one year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, most lenders offer equipment financing whether you’re buying new or used equipment, so you are not limited in your search for equipment solutions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Can You Afford New Equipment?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking on the burden of equipment financing is a big decision and one not to be made alone. Whether you own a sole proprietorship and seek the advice of your accountant or have a board of directors you need to get approval from, it is always a good idea to evaluate any big investment loan. This evaluation process is referred to as “</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/capital-budgeting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">capital budgeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and should be undertaken when assessing if a high-cost purchase actually brings value to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as you would not purchase new real estate without weighing all the pros and cons, the same can be said about making a costly equipment purchase. Is there a better use of the money you’re spending on the purchase? How soon after the purchase will the company see a return? What kind of impact will the equipment have on the current team running the business? Will making this investment postpone another purchase with more value?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the process of capital budgeting involves the following five methods:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Net present value (NPV).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you determine a purchase’s NPV, you are calculating the purchase’s value over a specific time period—specifically the difference between cash inflow and outflow. If the equipment has a positive NPV, it means by obtaining the machine, the company will generate more revenue than the final cost, even after financing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><b>. Internal rate of return (IRR).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The IRR can be used to compare two or more costly investments over one year. Like the NPV, this method helps compare the expected annual returns of different investments over 12 months.</span></li>
<li><b>Profitability index.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To determine the profitability index, you divide the present value of expected future cash flows by the capital expenditure—the financed equipment. When a purchase has a profitability index over 1, it is most likely a good investment.</span></li>
<li><b>Accounting rate of return (ARR).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The ARR compares the purchase’s expected average revenue to how much money will be invested—cash flow and specific time periods are not in the equation.</span></li>
<li><b>Payback period</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Finally, the payback period method determines how long it takes to break even on a capital investment such as equipment. For example, if a piece of equipment costs $600,000, and it will earn $200,000 a year, then the payback period is three years.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Using a Business Line of Credit </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to loans specially designated for equipment purchases, your business may want to investigate getting a business line of credit. A business line of credit is money you can access when you need it—like for purchasing business equipment. Unlike a traditional loan that has set terms of monthly payments, a business line of credit allows you to borrow only the specific amount needed and then repay only that amount. Plus, once the amount borrowed is paid back, it is available to borrow again. That is called a revolving line of credit, much like a credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit is not only a viable solution for equipment purchases, but it also comes in handy if you have other bills to pay and you are waiting for payment from clients. Also, when payroll is due, and your bank account is lacking, a business line of credit is a good backup plan to help keep your business operating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can apply online for Fundbox Line of Credit in two simple steps. Unlike a traditional business loan application, you will not have to complete any paperwork to get started, and you can get a decision right away.</span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>

Last summer, during a global pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-07b1c7b4-99d3-43b9-9759-a0c54919bdc2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a record number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans applied for new Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) or tax ID numbers, according to Axios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of startups has slowed some since then, there is still a lot of activity around startup businesses making 2021 an excellent time to start a business. And if you need some help regarding how to start your own business and which businesses you should start in 2021, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<h2>Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, you have a list of small business ideas that appeal to you. The idea is to identify those ideas that can become profitable small businesses. Often, startup entrepreneurs are advised to follow their passion. While that might work in some cases, the truth is just because you are passionate about something doesn’t mean consumers will care. The most successful businesses are the ones that offer products or services that consumers (whether B2B or B2C) want at a price they’re willing to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do consumers want today? Here are a few small business ideas that may be worth pursuing.</span></p>
<h2>B2C Small Business Ideas</h2>
<h3><b>E-commerce</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRF (National Retail Federation) forecasts overall 2021 retail sales to grow between 10.5% to 13.5 %, to between $4.44 trillion-$4.56 trillion. But the more important news is non-store, and</span><a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/retail-sales-now-exceed-444-trillion-2021-nrf-revises-annual-forecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online sales will likely range from $1.09 trillion to $1.13 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an increase of 18% to 23%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Baby products</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The NPD Group, </span><a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/u_s_juvenile_products_industry_grows_6_5_in_2020_reports_the_npd_group/prweb17721091.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents are buying a lot of products</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for their children. NPD says juvenile-products had revenues of $7.35 billion in 2020, up 6.5% in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular categories were:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety products, including health &amp; grooming products and baby gates. 2020 sales hit $587.5 million, up 35% from 2019.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture sales came in at $952.1 million, up 17% from 2019. Top sellers in this category included cribs, toddler beds, and children’s and baby furniture.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entertainment category, including activity seats/jumpers, and swings, rang up $963.6 million in sales.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Toys</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.npd.com/news/press-releases/2021/the-npd-group-u-s-toy-industry-retail-sales-grew-16-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales of toys</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to boom, generating sales of $25.1 billion in 2020, up 16%, according to a report from The NPD Group. Many of these sales took place online, boasting an amazing revenue growth of 75% growth from 2019 to 2020. NPD recommends brick-and-mortar retailers continue to offer BOPIS (buy online, pickup in-store) or curbside pickup options since they provide convenience to busy parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion dolls and accessories (+56%), sports toys, including skates, skateboards, and scooters (+31%), games (+29%), building sets (+26%), and summer seasonal toys (+24%) were top sellers.</span></p>
<h3><b>New online customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/ecommerce-website-builders">open an online store</a>, your target market of customers has significantly grown. Running a business online is an excellent side business idea or home business idea. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports baby boom </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2021/01/21/baby-boombers-online-shopping-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumers over 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are now the fastest-growing category of e-commerce shoppers, joining millions of millennials and Gen Zers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fastest-growing categories in the beauty industry is products targeting male customers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And per a report from CBS News, global research firm Mintel reports </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/male-makeup-is-catching-more-mens-eyes-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds of Gen Z males</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. are interested in gender-free beauty products, and not just products in traditional masculine packaging (dominated by deep red, green and black colors). According to Mintel, “9% of Gen Z males say they use some form of lighter, ‘no-makeup’ makeup, whether it’s tinted moisturizer, BB cream or CC (color correcting) cream.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, in the beauty industry, all the buzz is about clean beauty. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clean beauty market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to grow from revenues of $5.4 billion in 2020 to $11.6 billion in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean beauty means the products are safe and non-toxic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Home improvement</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likely due to the increased number of people working from home, many decided to </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to consumer research giant </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NPD Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020, consumers invested their home improvement dollars in their kitchens and baths (revenues were up 28%), while overall home improvement revenues rose 22%, and paint sales increased 16%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means there are opportunities for businesses that sell these home products. The outlook is also strong for contractors and remodelers. According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, which issues the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) report, forecasts remodeling industry revenues will reach </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$352 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, since many of us will be working from home for the foreseeable future, entrepreneurs selling organizational products or services are in high demand.</span></p>
<h3><b>Food trucks/ghost kitchens</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve always wanted to be in the food business, but the startup costs are too high, consider starting a food truck business or launching a ghost kitchen. Ghost (or virtual) kitchens thrived during the pandemic. They offer take-out and/or food delivery only and often can operate in less costly parts of a city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=3slWLw94I3jq-2B-2FedjFNgZA6lfN8-2Fc97iz7gquTp96XxiM8zX5vuEoiqGxTGsZDA97Aqp-2Bcj6sJYbLXRmu8Nzm8LaOl1TJn1eLtcDYWIioTw-3Dnf5S_dS0-2BUOGLGfm-2FZwhlLNY0jNAYK679fWlON-2B9lmycs5T3BmSbOZokpdb6MQmJSTy3kn2N1cnBHp06IaXmeVL-2B80ti4seJnL9YytXN7-2FgHMfSZJmJLGt-2FrTlRs-2BJBbnGoeZDWAYJd0fn2FXatGGHVLMTZU8fOGicWR3sPO50KgQ0u1ktTkARwGlEiDiFjZ75yEvUwEfvVX-2BBcvLtGpR3Fsbo7jQ21pu8mkK9f4BWauv3zQjFmnItmamZKX1fd7wmwRLTvbfufQvZ8V1sSXnoQ8BvkmFnjJOS-2FqTXVp7OtRxeYhMrf21vyAGnC2J4iG0DDWwC4KOlpt-2FiYpqQQRohCb8oQ-3D-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from industry insider, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">QSR Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said this about quick-service restaurant operators (QSRs): “You can see the appeal. Virtual kitchens are stripped-down commercial cooking spaces with no dine-in option. Functioning as hubs for online delivery and catering orders, they circumvent the need for costly buildouts in premium locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less prime real estate also means more space to accommodate delivery and catering vehicles that would otherwise jockey with customers for parking space.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tutoring</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutors are in great demand today, and starting a tutoring service is a great side business idea. </span><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Private-Tutor-Salary-per-Hour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZipRecruiter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports private tutors are averaging sales of nearly $45,000 a year.</span></p>
<h2>B2B Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All those new startups are going to need help launching and growing their businesses. This means there’s a lot of opportunities for businesses that serve other businesses (B2B). Business services in demand include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountants and bookkeepers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan writers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation services</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual assistant</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Business formation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you decide on what type of business you want to start, you need to take care of the details. Of prime importance is </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choosing the business formation structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s right for you. If you don’t want to incorporate, the simplest and least costly option is to operate as a sole proprietor. If you don’t </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/register-business-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register a separate name for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your state, your first and last name will become, by default, your company’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run a sole proprietorship, there is no legal shield between you and the business. That means you can be personally sued by unhappy clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many business owners are starting an LLC (limited liability companies), which are considered a separate legal entity from its owner/s, which means they’re protected from personal liability for any debts and claims on the business. If you own an LLC, you are required to keep your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-expenses-taxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business’s finances and expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> separate from yours or other members of the LLC.</span></p>
<h2>Which is right for you?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each business structure has its pros, cons, and tax consequences, so before choosing the one that’s best for your company, consult with your accountant and attorney.</span></p>

If you start to falter, your business will, too. How can you keep your energy and productivity levels up when the demands on your time are never-ending? Here are tips to help keep you invigorated all day long.</p>
<h2><strong>7 Productivity Tips to Stay Energized All Day</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get enough sleep</strong></h3>
<p>Getting enough Z&#8217;s is easier said than done for a small business owner, but you simply must make time to rejuvenate—studies have linked getting fewer than 6 hours of sleep a night to a host of health problems, including greater risk of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-metabolic-syndrome-idUSKCN0SG2OG20151022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diabetes and heart disease</a>. Figure out how you can delegate or eliminate tasks that keep you up at night. Check out these <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/05/10/sleep-tips-and-strategies-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep-from-arianna-huffington/#7f23e18a3b41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 tips for getting better sleep</a> from entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, whose new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Revolution-Transforming-Your-Night/dp/1101904003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sleep Revolution</em></a> promotes the importance of adequate sleep for improved productivity.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Eat right</strong></h3>
<p>Do you regularly skip breakfast? Are you too busy to grab lunch? Bad idea. Eating smaller meals and healthy snacks on a regular schedule ensures your blood sugar (and energy levels) stay stable and helps you maximize productivity. It also keeps you from getting so hungry that you head to the nearest vending machine or fast-food drive-thru. Eat mostly lean proteins, fruits, vegetables and whole grains; cut back on sugar and processed foods, which make you sluggish. Small snacks that combine protein and fiber will fill you up without weighing you down.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Stay hydrated</strong></h3>
<p>Often, what seems like fatigue or hunger is just dehydration. Aim to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, and next time you feel tired, try downing a glass to see if that helps. Avoid (or at least limit your intake of) alcohol—it&#8217;s dehydrating. If plain water is too boring, add lemon, lime, or cucumber slices to give it some flavor. Need caffeine? If you must drink coffee or tea, balance out their dehydrating effects by drinking an equal amount of water.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Take breaks</strong></h3>
<p>Ever notice when you grind on and on at work for hours, you get less productive and more distracted? It&#8217;s not your imagination. Keep your energy high by taking regular short breaks throughout the day. The <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomodoro Technique</a>, which alternates 25-minute stretches of work with 5-minute breaks, is a well-known system for doing this, but you can also create your own system by setting a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stand-up!-the-work-break-timer/id828244687?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work break timer</a> on your phone or computer to remind you when to get up, move around, and/or do some stretches.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get active</strong></h3>
<p>Find a way to fit in a regular fitness routine, whether it&#8217;s walking, running, Pilates, or hitting the gym. You don&#8217;t have to be an Ironman to benefit, either—even moderate exercise has health benefits that positively impact your energy level. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=D9HQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Robert+Thayer,+PhD+study+10+minute+walk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tWOcfBmqOr&amp;sig=yJM8W1h1NBKaWzqcM3hBmSPrC8M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilmsn6y9LMAhVGm5QKHSKoD4QQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Thayer%2C%20PhD%20study%2010%20minute%20walk&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experiments by Robert Thayer</a>, Ph.D., of California State University showed taking a brisk 10-minute walk boosted subjects&#8217; energy for up to two hours afterwards. That makes taking a quick walk a great option for your breaks. You can combine walking with work by walking around and talking to employees or holding &#8220;walking meetings.&#8221;</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Lessen stress</strong></h3>
<p>Sure, some stress is good and keeps us energized, but too much stress on an ongoing basis saps your energy levels. Figure out what your biggest stressors are, and develop a plan to tame them. That can mean delegating responsibilities, changing how you run your business, or even saying so long to that client who gives you heartburn. Meditation, prayer, and finding a sounding board—whether that&#8217;s a board of advisors, a friend or family member—can also help ease your stress.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Mix it up</strong></h3>
<p>Variety is the spice of life—and business. Doing the same thing all day can steal your energy, so change your routine whenever possible. For instance, if you&#8217;ve been in meetings all morning, take some quiet time in the afternoon to focus on a project that needs your full attention. Or, if you&#8217;ve been staring at Excel spreadsheets all day, going to lunch or dinner with a colleague should hopefully energize you.</li>

That’s the question many small business owners struggle with as they’re growing their businesses. While invoicing and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting paid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are vital to a small company’s survival, your business also needs to get a handle on invoice processing for your accounts payable system. Late payments could mean losing key vendors and receiving a lower business credit score for a small business, making it harder to secure funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to take your accounts payable invoice processing by the reins? Here are several ways to start:</span></p>
<h2>1. Dictate the Invoice Processing Procedure</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with accounts receivables, your business is pretty much at the mercy of the clients or customers who pay you. You can request to be paid in a specific number of days and offer several payment methods, but when and how you get paid is ultimately out of your control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For accounts payable, in most cases, you can inform vendors about your accounts payable system and then negotiate from there. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Purchase Order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Will your business need a purchase order before the project or sale is completed? For some industries, a purchase order is standard. But, even if your business doesn’t usually receive purchase orders, in some cases, it can be a beneficial first step in the sales relationship. A purchase order contains helpful information, such as a detailed description of the order, including quantity and unit price, as well as payment terms and delivery specifics. Purchase orders help make sales more transparent for the buyer and seller, so there is a smaller chance of misunderstandings later.</span></li>
<li><b>Method of Invoicing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How and when do you want to be invoiced? For example, do you prefer receiving invoices by mail or email or through an automated invoice processing program? Of course, the seller might have their own preferred way of invoicing, but, as the buyer, you can request invoices to suit your invoice processing.</span></li>
<li><b>The Details.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What information do you want included on the invoice? Depending on your purchases, you may want more detail on the product or services, such as color, weight, materials for products, and date of services completed. Do you want the name of the person receiving the bill printed right on the invoice? If there is a purchase order number, that should also be included for cross-reference.</span></li>
<li><b>Payment Terms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s essential to have the payment terms included on the invoice, including the due date, discount for early payments, and any potential late fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Streamline the Accounts Payable Process</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not your company is big enough to have an accounting department, the key to streamlining your accounts payable process is to have an official procedure and a system of checks and balances. Without either, you open up your business to costly mistakes, fraud, and possible embezzlement. Many businesses use the following accounts payable steps to streamline invoice processing.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Never have one person in charge of accounts payable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To avoid errors and fraud, it’s a good idea to have two or three people in charge of your AP reconciliations and payments.</span></li>
<li><b>Set up an approval system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One person receives the invoices and checks them to make sure the information is complete and correct. If there’s a purchase order, it should be checked against the invoice. Then a different person should approve the invoice and schedule the payment. In most small businesses, the owner approves the invoice, and then it goes back to the original person for scheduling. If you have enough staff, consider putting one person in charge of final approvals before the payment goes out.</span></li>
<li><b>Get automated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The easiest way to streamline your invoice processing is to use accounting software to automate most of the processes, eliminating errors due to messy handwriting or the transposition of numbers. Look for a program that’s not only user-friendly but also one with lots of customizable reporting features that can scale as your business grows. Once you get started, you’ll find going paperless makes it easier to stay organized.</span></li>
<li><b>Use the program features to their full extent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Accounting software systems offer a range of features, so it may take an extensive learning curve to become familiar with the system. However, it’s important to enter as much information as possible because it will save you time in the long run. For example, record as much information about the vendor as you can, including credit terms, due dates, W-9s for 1099s, etc.</span></li>
<li><b>Train your staff</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being automated doesn’t eliminate human error, so your team should be thoroughly trained about using your invoicing program. Make sure you keep accounting information password protected and only give access to a few people.</span></li>
<li><b>Automate some monthly payments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you feel confident about your business’s monthly cash flow, consider automatically scheduling some regular vendor payments. Utility companies make it easy to autopay, but the information needs to be correctly entered into the system. You can cut out a lot of wasted tasks by automating some of your invoice processing.</span></li>
<li><b>Supervise accounts aging reports</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your accounting system keeps track of what is due when so you can see, at a glance, when you’ll need to have cash on hand to pay bills. If you know you have a big payable coming up, accounts aging reports help you maintain your budget and avoid bounced checks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Pay Your Invoices on Time</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late or missing payments negatively affect your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than any other factor. Plus, once your credit score takes a hit, it’s not that easy to build it up again. Vendors may look at business credit scores before deciding to do business with you and neither the vendor nor the credit company has to tell you they requested your score. According to Experian </span><a href="https://www.businesscreditfacts.com/pdp.aspx?pg=faq-03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval is not needed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the business for someone to order their business credit report. This differs from personal credit reports which are regulated under permissible purposes only. Therefore, you may never know why your business didn’t get the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking advantage of early payment discounts, keeping your invoice processing system current, and ensuring you have adequate cash flow, you can avoid missed or late payments. On the other hand, every business owner gets caught short at some point in the life of a business, so it’s essential to have a backup plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many business owners turn to factoring (also known as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to temporarily increase cash flow. With </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you sell your unpaid invoices to the factoring company, and they collect payment directly from your customers and you will likely receive 60-95% of the invoice value, not the entire amount. But using Fundbox’s invoice financing system, if approved, you work directly with your customers and get the full value of the invoice (up to your credit limit) quickly deposited into your bank account. The repayment process is easy, and there’s no prepayment penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to stay on top of paying your bills is to have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ready to access whenever you’re short on cash. A line of credit is a preset amount of funds your business can access when you need it and pay it back later. Unlike a term loan (which has a fixed repayment), with some lenders you can pay back the line of credit in full or in payments without any early repayment fees. The best part of a line of credit is once you’ve paid back the borrowed amount, you have full access to the funds again without having to reapply for a loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers access to invoice financing, term loans, and lines of credit, all of which can help improve your business’s cash flow and make vendor payments on time. Cash flow is an integral part of streamlined invoice processing, so contact us today to get started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ron J. Williams has built a career out of getting inside customers’ heads. For the past 11 years, this energetic entrepreneur has </span><span style="font-style: italic;">founded, built, invested in, and advised on peer-to-peer, sharing economy, marketplace, social data, and social commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Named by Fast Company as one of its </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3018247/most-creative-people-2012/62-ron-j-williams">100 Most Creative People in Business</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">, Williams is passionate about applying technology to “regular-people problems.” His current venture, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">proofLabs</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, is a strategy, product, and innovation consultancy that helps teams build the perfect products for their customers faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">In his spare time, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Williams</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> advises organizations such as </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://build.org/">BUILD NYC</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://www.stoked.org/">Stoked Mentoring</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://codeinteractive.org/">Code Interactive</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> that transform how </span><span style="font-style: italic;">young people</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of color see themselves and their opportunities in tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Understanding others’ perspectives is vital to the process at proofLabs, and Williams believes it’s essential to the success of any startup.

Williams, Managing Partner at proofLabs.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Fundbox: Tell us how you got started in business.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ron J. Williams:</span> My first job [out of college] as an investment banker has served me well even 20 years later. I learned to ask questions: How do you come up with a model for what drives the business? How do you find out where the value is created?</p>
<p>[After working on Wall Street], I started a company that was an early entrant into the sharing economy. Eventually the business failed because I wasn&#8217;t focused on customer needs as acutely as I should have been. That realization was where proofLabs started.</p>
<h3>Jeff Bezos once said, “At Amazon, we’ve always focused on our customers, [not on] our competition.”</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> Bezos is a great [example] of the singular focus on not just the customer, but a specific way in which you add value for a customer. He has laid out very plainly, ‘We’re serving a customer, they are the only group that we care about, and the specific way that we add value to them is we give them the best selection of the least expensive products.’</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, that means everybody on the team, from Jeff Bezos down to the warehouse, knows the metric by which they will ultimately be judged is, ‘Did we create value for the customer?’</p>
<p>A lot of startup [entrepreneurs] think they’re visionaries. If they&#8217;re really good, they get investors excited to buy into their vision. But investors are not [your] customer and getting them excited isn’t the same thing as understanding the real pain point of the customer day-to-day.</p>
<p>We interview customers [to get their perspectives for our clients]. When we get a sense of recurring [pain points], we find somebody who has expressed the pains most acutely. Then we’ll pull their photo and write up their bio. That goes up on everybody&#8217;s desk throughout the office, so the whole team can say, ‘This is who we&#8217;re building for’—not some made-up persona or amalgamation of people.</p>
<p>[You] can have really smart people and really good ideas and still miss the point if you don&#8217;t start with one very real person and solve the problem they&#8217;re having. Whether I&#8217;m helping to redesign a product or create a go-to-market plan, it starts with going back to the customer, crawling into that person&#8217;s head, [standing] in their shoes, living with them and understanding how they think about the world.</p>
<p>I call that skill ‘perspective-taking.’</p>
<h3>Can perspective-taking create a more effective workplace?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> In conflict with teams, I&#8217;ve seen folks going at each other&#8217;s throats. If you just dig in a little bit you realize that what they&#8217;re really arguing about is not, &#8220;My idea is good and your idea is bad.&#8221; It&#8217;s, &#8220;You&#8217;re thinking on a six-month timeline, I’m thinking on an 18-month timeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being able to take in the other’s perspective can help you reframe your argument or request in ways that reflect [their] understanding and perspective.</p>
<h3>It sounds like perspective taking can also help create more inclusivity in business.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> If products come from problems that we solve, and if problems that are worth solving come from understanding people&#8217;s experiences and their pain, then if we look back at the past 25 years of the internet, we&#8217;ve largely only solved problems for Silicon Valley white males. That&#8217;s a small fraction of the population.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an economic reason why we should be investing in solving the trillions of dollars’ worth of problems that we don&#8217;t even understand because they&#8217;re somebody else&#8217;s unique, very niche problem [that doesn’t fit into that mold]. We have to learn how to network and resource black and brown founders, female founders, LGBTQ founders and then get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>People pay a ton of lip service [to diversity in business]. But it&#8217;s not enough to hope that we bump into more women or more LGBT folks at a party and then invite them to [work with us]. We have to go actively seek folks out. That is not about quotas. It&#8217;s active participation in progressively changing values.</p>
<h3>What’s your best advice for entrepreneurs putting together their growth plans?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> First, figure out what you really want. In designing your business, what you&#8217;re really doing is designing your life.</p>
<p>A business has a natural upper limit that’s a function of lots of things: How long do you want to run it? How much stress do you want to take on? Is it about [part-time income], or this is supposed to be the “big kahuna?”</p>
<p>There’s a product I&#8217;m tinkering with—a simple product for prepping people for meetings. If that kicked off $50,000 a year, that would be an awesome little pet project.</p>
<p>If I decide I want to put all my eggs in that basket, I would need that thing to be a real business. I’d have to ask, &#8220;Can we grow this into a $20 million business?&#8221;</p>
<p>If I want to raise venture capital, I’d have to ask, “Can we make this a $100 million business?”</p>
<p>The goalposts shift depending on your aspirations, your ambitions, your limitations, your constraints.</p>
<h3>You’re passionate about the power of networking. Why do you think this is so important for entrepreneurs?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> It&#8217;s not enough to give people advice and tools. It&#8217;s really important that we network. Let’s help communities of entrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, find people to work with, because that&#8217;s where real consumer innovation comes from and where forward momentum is.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is connect good people to build awesome stuff. There&#8217;s nothing better than having an army of people walking around with your best interests in mind because you&#8217;re here to help create value for them too. People doing work even when you&#8217;re not, to help you out—it&#8217;s such a powerful thing.</p>

As you know, cash flow is crucial to a small business’s survival. Unfortunately, late payments have become far all too common, which puts many small businesses at risk. A</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fundbox-study-reveals-crippling-effects-of-late-or-unpaid-invoices-300424576.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox survey</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed 64% of SMBs have dealt with  a past-due invoice which caused the following repercussions in their companies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% of small business owners couldn’t pay themselves</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23% couldn’t hire new employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23% were unable to invest in new equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% stopped their marketing efforts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18% delayed pay increases or bonuses for employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17% weren’t able to build their inventory</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the customer’s end, an outstanding payment is no picnic either. Late payments can lead to lower credit scores and the embarrassment of being hunted down for money or being turned over to collections.</span></p>
<h2>The Life of an Invoice</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoices are born in several different ways: They can get created before the project starts, or the transfer of goods occurs, or come at the end of the sale once the agreement is completed. In any case, the invoice notice informs the recipient of the amount of payment that’s due, when payment is due, and what forms of payment are accepted. It may also contain a purchase order number, a notice of early payment discount, and penalty fees for a past-due invoice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the invoice reaches the customer, it is usually either paid right away or entered into the customer’s system and then scheduled for payment. However, sometimes the unexpected occurs. There may be unforeseen circumstances that can delay payment, or your customer could have simply forgotten to pay. In these cases, the recommended  practice is to act immediately. You want to give customers the impression they need to make their payments on time. .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do  you request payment from past-due invoices? Take a look at  these tips.</span></p>
<h2>Writing the Past-Due Invoice Letter</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll likely want to act soon after the payment is late. The definition of late depends on your industry’s accepted practices. You also should consider whether the customer repeatedly pays late or if this is a rare occurrence. Then you need to decide when to chase the unpaid invoice down and politely remind your customer about the unpaid invoice. That payment reminder usually starts with a past-due invoice letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fastest method to send a past-due invoice letter is by email, and that’s become an accepted practice by most customers today. Sending by email also allows you to attach a request receipt, so you’ll know when your customer has opened your email. Be aware the person you sent the message  to may have to approve the read receipt  before you’re notified. You can also send your past-due invoice letter via postal mail, but you’ll be left wondering whether the letter was ever received. Whichever way you send the reminder, make sure you record the date it was sent and schedule how soon you want to follow up. Invoicing programs allow you to automate sending reminders, so you don’t forget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the letter must contain all the pertinent information about the past-due invoice and payment details, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of the original invoice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice number, date of invoice, and the date you are sending the reminder</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details of the service provided or products purchased</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount owed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment terms, including late fees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment options</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contact person’s name, phone number, email, and hours the person can be reached</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the tone of the past-due invoice letter as you’re writing it. You may want to address a past-due invoice that’s a few days to a week late in a polite and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding tone. If the invoice is overdue, your language in the past-due invoice letter could  be more robust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between overdue and past-due pertains to time. A past-due invoice denotes the deadline for payment has recently passed, while overdue means an invoice payment is considerably late. An overdue invoice letter needs to convey urgency and relate the consequences if the payment remains in default. Hopefully, it won’t come to this. Still, if it does, think about turning the invoice over to a collection agency and let the customer know that’s one of your considerations if payment isn’t forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t feel comfortable creating this type of letter, search the internet for a past-due invoice email template to guide you through the process.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/invoicing/writing-overdue-invoice-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests using polite phrases when corresponding with your customers. Their research shows b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eing polite in your past-due invoice letters can actually</span> <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/invoice-payment-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help you get paid.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Invoices that included terms like “please pay your invoice within” and “thank you for your business” were 5% more likely to be paid. And, they add, you should make sure to include the words “please” and “thank you” in your letter even when the invoice is months overdue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also include links to payment options with the tagline: “for your convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month or more, it may be time to toughen your tone. Think about using phrases such as “Action Required” and “Urgent Matter.”</span></p>
<h2>The Phone Call</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company has sent three or more past-due invoice letters, then it may be time  to make a friendly phone call. Once you get someone on the phone, it becomes more difficult for them to avoid you </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would want to approach the phone call with a positive attitude and the assumption that the customer has either forgotten about payment or is too embarrassed to respond because they cannot pay you at this time. Your company will have a better chance of getting paid if you can come to an understanding, such as creating a payment schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be ready to accept payment over the telephone and have all the information you need on hand, so you don’t have to scramble. If the person is not ready to make payment at this time, try to find out what the hold-up is. Consider setting up a follow up call in a few days and let them know of any late fees you may charge . Late fees are typically determined by using an interest calculator, which calculates the cost based on the number of days the payment is late.</span></p>
<h2>The Final Push</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe payment is not forthcoming, you need to decide whether you want to send the past-due invoice to a collection agency and report the customer to the credit bureaus. If it’s gone this far, you’re likely to lose the customer for good, but you may not want to continue to do business with them anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, because late payments are common when running a small business, it’s crucial to have a backup plan, so your cash flow isn’t seriously disrupted. Securing a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ensures you’ll have cash on hand in case of serious shortfalls. A line of credit gives you access to the capital you need and the confidence to handle late payment challenges without breaking a sweat.</span></p>

While you’re probably on top of metrics such as cash flow and sales projections, you may not be as diligent in monitoring your cash conversion cycle. Here’s a closer look at what the cash conversion cycle is, how to calculate it, and why it matters to you and to any potential financing sources you may approach.</p>
<h2>What is a company’s cash conversion cycle?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes called the net operating cycle or cash cycle or cash-to-cash cycle time, the cash conversion cycle (CCC) measures how long it takes your business to convert cash into inventory, then into sales, and finally back into cash again. You calculate the cash conversion cycle by figuring out how long it takes you to sell inventory, how long it takes you to collect your accounts receivable, and how soon you can pay your accounts payable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three components of the cash conversion cycle are: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the average time to convert inventory into finished goods and then sell them. You can calculate DIO by taking your average inventory, dividing by the cost of goods sold, and then multiplying by 365. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the average number of days your accounts receivable takes to be collected. You can calculate DSO by taking your accounts receivable, dividing by net credit sales, and then multiplying by 365.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the average length of time it takes your business to purchase from vendors and then pay (accounts payable) them. You arrive at DPO by taking the ending accounts payable and dividing by (cost of goods sold ÷ 365).</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cash conversion cycle can be expressed as a formula:</span></p>
<h3>CCC = Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) + Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) – Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)</h3>
<h2>What’s a good cash conversion cycle?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good cash conversion cycle is a short one. If your CCC is a low or (better yet) a negative number, that means your working capital is not tied up for long, and your business has greater liquidity. Many online retailers have low or even negative CCCs because they drop-ship instead of maintaining inventory, get paid right away when customers buy products and do not have to pay for the inventory until customers have already paid them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your CCC is a positive number, you do not want it to be too high. A positive CCC reflects how many days your business’s working capital is tied up while you are waiting for your accounts receivable to be paid. You may have a high CCC if you sell products on credit and have customers who typically take 30, 60, or even 90 days to pay you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several ways you can shorten your business’s cash conversion cycle. For one, make sure your accounts receivable process is as efficient as possible. Declutter your invoices of unnecessary jargon and be clear on what you’re invoicing for and the terms you’re asking. The quicker the customer understands the invoice, the faster you’ll get paid. You can also shorten the CCC by asking for upfront payments or offering a discount for early payment. Finally, it’s a good idea to stay on top of late payments by following up immediately when a payment comes due.</span></p>
<h2>How cash flow fits in</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cash conversion cycle is a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calculation that measures the period it takes your business to convert inventory and other resources into cash. In other words, the cash-to-cash cycle time is the amount of time between when you pay for inventory and the time it takes for customers to pay to replenish your business’s cash flow. For companies with heavy inventory and material demands, such as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/solution-construction-companies-cash-flow-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, keeping cash flow positive might make the difference between taking on new clients or turning them away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversion cycle calculation helps a business determine how long their cash is tied up before it’s collected from clients and customers. Keeping a close watch on the business’s CCC helps monitor its overall finances as cash flows in and out. If you’re wondering about cash flow vs. profit, the two are not the same thing. While profit is the amount of money left after the business’s expenses have been paid at a specific point of time, cash flow is, well, fluid. It indicates the net flow of cash in and out of a business.</span></p>
<h2>What’s the difference between operating cycle and cash conversion cycle?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operating cycle is the number of days between when you </span><b><i>buy</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inventory and when customers pay for the inventory. The cash conversion cycle is the number of days between when you </span><b><i>pay</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for inventory and when you get paid by your customers for the inventory.</span></p>
<h2>Why the cash conversion cycle matters</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several reasons it is essential to monitor your cash conversion cycle:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors, lenders, and other financing sources often assess a company’s cash conversion cycle to determine its financial health and, in particular, its liquidity. The more liquid a company is, the more easily it can pay back a business loan, meet its other financial obligations and invest in growth. The cash conversion cycle is most beneficial to assess inventory-based businesses, such as retailers. It is not the only financial yardstick that financing sources use; they generally combine it with other measures before deciding whether to make the loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppliers sometimes factor in your CCC when deciding whether to extend your company credit. If your business lacks adequate liquidity, they may worry you won’t be able to pay them on time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cash conversion cycle matters to you, as well. A low CCC indicates you are doing well at converting inventory to cash and shows your business is operating efficiently. On the other hand, if your CCC is too high, it may be a sign of operational issues, a lack of demand for your product, or a declining market niche. If your CCC isn’t to your liking, figure out what the problem is and take steps to correct it, such as being more aggressive in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/1-in-3-u-s-businesses-have-invoices-that-are-at-least-90-days-overdue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting your invoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, your cash conversion cycle is an important measure to take when you figure out how much money you need to borrow. Understanding your CCC and, as a result, your business’s liquidity can help you calculate how much cash you can ask a lender for.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your cash conversion cycle fail to measure up to what lenders are looking for? There are still ways to get the money you need. Consider alternative financing sources, such as invoice-based financing from Fundbox.</span></p>

<p><b>But wait! Don’t breathe a sigh of relief yet! The May 17 tax extension does not apply to everyone. The extension only applies to individuals filing Forms 1040 and 1040-SR</b><b>. It does not affect deadlines for corporate, partnership, or nonprofit tax returns, or payment of estimated taxes. For all other entities, the tax deadlines remain as they were  in a normal tax year.</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do these dates still seem confusing? Let’s get back to the business of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing your company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here are four COVID-19 considerations for your business taxes.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Business Taxes by Entity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal structure is everything when it comes to filing business taxes. Your legal entity dictates the forms you use, how your business is taxed, and the withholdings you must submit. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sole proprietors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have any legal separation from their businesses and therefore file their personal income on a Schedule C (IRS Form 1040) “Profit or Loss From Business.” Typically due </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by April 15, for 2021, this deadline has been delayed until May 17, with an extended deadline of October 15, 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the business owner expects to pay $1,000 or more in business taxes in one calendar year, the IRS expects the sole proprietor to pay quarterly estimated taxes. And those deadlines did not change. Quarterly tax deadlines remain as:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment period: January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021, tax deadline = April 15, 2021</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment period: April 1, 2021 to May 31, 2021, tax deadline = June 15, 2021</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment period: June 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021, tax deadline = September 15, 2021</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment period: September 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, tax deadline = January 18, 2022</span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Partnerships</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also have no legal separation from the business, and business tax obligations are passed equally through to the partners (unless the partnership agreement specifies otherwise). Partnerships use IRS Form 1065 (known as the U.S. Return of Partnership) to file the partnership’s profits and losses. Also, a partnership must file a Schedule K of Form 1065 (to categorize the partnership’s income), and each partner receives a Schedule K-1 to turn in with their personal taxes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership filing deadline was March 15, 2021, with an extended deadline of September 15, 2021.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">are taxed like partnerships with the same tax forms and deadlines (Form 1065 and Schedule K and K-1). LLCs can choose to be taxed as a C Corp or an S Corp; however, all member-owners must agree.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>C Corporations </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are legally separate from the business owners and consequently file separate tax returns. C Corp owners are employees of the corporation and must receive a W-2 from the corporation. The C Corps tax deadline is April 15, 2021, and they file IRS Form 1120 (U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return). The business can file for an extension which makes the deadline October 15, 2021. Corporations make estimated tax payments if they expect their estimated tax to be $500 or more. C Corps use Form 1120-W to make estimated tax payments.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The S Corp </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an optional legal election extended to LLCs and C Corps so the businesses can be taxed as a partnership, preventing the corporation’s double taxation. In the S Corp, business income is passed through to the owners and then claimed on their personal tax returns. S Corps use IRS Form 1120-S, and the tax deadline was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2021, with an extended deadline of September 15, 2021</span><b>.</b></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. More Deadlines</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To quickly recap, this year the regular business tax deadline for 1040 and 1040-SR filers is May 17, 2021. For corporations and LLCs, the filing deadline remains April 15, 2021 (or if you file for an extension, October 15, 2021). For partnerships and S Corps, the tax deadline was March 15, 2021, or if you file for an extension, September 15, 2021. Importantly, if you owe taxes and don’t file for an extension, you may be subject to penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRS allows businesses three years from the tax deadline to submit a return and claim a refund. If you completely fail to submit a return, the IRS can file a substitute form for you, but you won’t receive the tax credits and deductions you are allowed. Also, failure to file can affect your business’s ability to apply for business loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tax years 2019 and earlier, it is too late to e-file. You must download the paper forms required and submit them by mail.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Employer Taxes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have one employee, a staff of 50, or more, your small business tax responsibilities include withholding and paying employment taxes to federal and state tax agencies. While federal payroll tax rates are the same no matter where your business is located, state employment taxes depend on the state income tax rates where the employee lives or does most of their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers are required to obtain an </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer Identification Number or EIN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An EIN (or Federal Tax ID number) identifies your business to the IRS and helps the agency track business transactions and tax records. You are also required to verify all employees are legally eligible to work in the United States by completing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. Employees then fill out IRS Form W-4 for tax withholding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an employer, you are required to withhold, deposit, report, and pay FICA employment taxes—FICA taxes include income tax, Social Security tax, Medicare tax. Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) is paid separately. 2020 employer tax rates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security: 6.2% for both employers and employees</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare tax: 1.45% for both employers and employees (Employers withhold an extra 0.9% of Medicare tax when an employee’s wage exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly).</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Unemployment Tax or FUTA: 6% is only paid by employers. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers pay and report FICA payroll taxes when employees get paid; FUTA taxes are paid quarterly. State payroll taxes vary by state, but most include income taxes and unemployment taxes.</span></p>
<h2>4. COVID-19 Tax Changes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CARES Act and subsequent relief packages provided business owners with the following changes which may or may not affect their business tax returns:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIDL Advance grants received in 2020 are not considered taxable income.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your PPP loan is partially or fully forgiven, the forgiven amount won’t count as part of your business’s gross income, which means you won’t have to pay taxes on it. Even if your PPP loan is not forgiven, you will not have to pay federal taxes on the funds you received.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some states have chosen to treat PPP funds differently for state taxes, whether or not the loan is forgivable, so check with your accountant on your state’s position.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To be </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forgivable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 60% of the funds must be used for payroll and 40% for other forgivable expenses such as rent, mortgage interest, utilities, some technologies, property damage expenses due to civil unrest, and personal protection equipment (PPE).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employee Retention Credit (ERC, or Employee Retention Tax Credit/ERTC). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that had to fully or partially close business operations during any quarter of 2020 or experienced a significant decline in gross receipts due to the pandemic are allowed to claim an </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/new-law-extends-covid-tax-credit-for-employers-who-keep-workers-on-payroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee Retention Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, the ERC has been extended to include the operational period between December 31, 2020, through June 30, 2021. Employers can claim a refundable tax credit against the employer share of Social Security tax equal to 70% of the qualified wages during the extended six months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Payroll Tax Deferment. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers who took the tax deferment on Social Security tax from March 27, 2020, through December 31, 2020, need to pay half of the deferred amount by December 31, 2021. The remaining taxes must be paid by December 31, 2022.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that offered family leave to workers affected by the coronavirus are eligible for tax credits for 100% of sick-leave pay, family-leave pay, and qualified healthcare plan expenses.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expansion of Charitable Gift Deductions. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">C Corps are allowed a higher limit for cash donations in 2020—25% in 2020. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of this is quite complex, and there are more tax considerations than usual to deal with this year. Also, the regulations are all still subject to change, so it’s a good idea to consult with your accountant to make sure nothing slips between the cracks. </span></p>
