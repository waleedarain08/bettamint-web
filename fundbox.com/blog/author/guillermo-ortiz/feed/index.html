<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fundbox customer and digital marketing expert Guillermo Ortiz is sharing some of his hard-earned knowledge to help business owners improve their online presence and get more sales. Guillermo is an experienced SEO and PPC expert and the owner of </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.geekpoweredstudios.com/">Geek Powered Studios</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">. In </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Part 3 of our digital marketing crash course guest post series, Guillermo will focus on how you can use Facebook ads, pay per click (PPC) ads, and popups to generate more traffic and conversions.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9271" style="width: 233px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-9271" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guillermo-Ortiz-Headshot.jpeg" alt="Guillermo Ortiz, Founder of Geek Powered Studios" width="233" height="233" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guillermo-Ortiz-Headshot.jpeg 233w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guillermo-Ortiz-Headshot-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9271" class="wp-caption-text">Guillermo Ortiz, Founder of Geek Powered Studios</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Using Facebook Ads</h2>
<p>Facebook ads are one of the best ways to start growing your business<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/11/facebook-newsfeed-big-change/1023331001/"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/11/facebook-newsfeed-big-change/1023331001/">despite the recent announcement made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</a></span> In our experience, a well constructed Facebook campaign can generate leads at the lowest CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) compared to other digital marketing channels.</p>
<p>Facebook has the unique ability to target users based on their demographics, interests and behaviors to help ensure you get your ads in front of the right users. What makes Facebook ads even more powerful is how they compliment your other marketing efforts.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/28/tech/mobile/survey-phones-facebook/index.html"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/28/tech/mobile/survey-phones-facebook/index.html">People check Facebook an average of 14 times a day!</a></span></p>
<p>Retargeting PPC, website, and other traffic on the platform can work extremely well. There are also a multitude of different ways to target past customers by uploading their emails, phone numbers, and letting Facebook match that data to existing users. I could write a whole separate article about the robust targeting options with audiences, but the easy wins are retargeting campaigns and utilizing your current customer data through the platform.</p>
<p>An example campaign that we ran for an Austin orthodontist generated leads for $4. She was generating leads through Google Adwords for $50+.</p>
<p>In this campaign, we targeted the demographic that converted best on their website with a lead generation campaign. In this case, that demographic was Spanish-speaking women, ages 35+ with children.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/8b63caa2-d418-4bd4-b36d-ae14baf31a1a_pasted20image200.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>For a mobile home manufacturer, we also ran a lead generation campaign that was able to generate $1 Million dollars with just over $2000. That’s a return of over 18,000%.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of examples. It’s extremely common to find that FB is your best marketing channel once you figure out the right messaging to the right audience.</p>
<h3>Facebook Ad Action Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Set up your Facebook pixel (to allow for retargeting)</li>
<li>Upload past customer data to create a past customer audience</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pay Per Click</h2>
<p>Pay per click, or “PPC”, is an auction-based system for strategically showing ads to users who are conducting internet searches. Every click will cost you a set amount depending on the competitiveness of the keyword being targeting.</p>
<p>For example, someone in San Antonio may do a search for &#8216;solar company san antonio&#8217;, click on an ad costing the advertiser $5, then land on the solar company&#8217;s page. The key to pay per click is getting one of these clicks to &#8216;convert&#8217; or take action through a phone call or contact form submission.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://unbounce.com/ppc/seo-vs-ppc-infographic/"> PPC visitors are 50% more likely to purchase something than organic visitors.</a></span></p>
<p>The key with PPC is to get the lowest CPA (cost per acquisition) possible. This is accomplished by optimizing your campaign frequently to ensure you have great ads driving quality traffic to a high performing landing page. You can learn more about PPC by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj-k9wzExMA"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj-k9wzExMA">watching this video.</a></span></p>
<p>Below is an example ad and landing page we use for an actual client. The ad and the landing page have a conversion rate of 20%+ which is very high for this type of advertising. You’ll notice that the ad mentions that they’ve been in business since 1982 which is a huge trust builder. The landing page also mentions that the business gives first time customers $20 OFF.</p>
<p>Offers like this work great with PPC. Test different messaging/landing page combinations until you find the one that converts the best. Here’s the text we used in the ad:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bryantelectricservice.com/?keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D">Texas Electrician</a></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bryantelectricservice.com/?keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D">Serving Austin Since 1982.</a></span></p>

<h3>PPC Action Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Setup conversion tracking</li>
<li>Determine a target cost per lead</li>
<li>Think of an offer</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popups/Whitepapers</h2>
<p>Everyone says they hate pop ups, but nobody can deny how effective they are.<a href="https://unbounce.com/lead-generation/ecommerce-popup-helped-generate-1-million/"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://unbounce.com/lead-generation/ecommerce-popup-helped-generate-1-million/">Canvas Factory utilized them to the tune of over $1.1 million dollars in purchases</a></span>. Try thinking of a compelling offer you can give visitors so you can capture their email. That email can be utilized to retarget them on any of the platforms mentioned here in additional to being emailed directly. This greatly increases the chance of converting them into an actual customer.</p>
<p>We also mentioned automating emails and sending one off campaigns in our first tip. Pop ups are an effective way to build up an email list of potential customers. In the example pop up below, one of our clients utilizes it to collect client information from people that are about to ‘abandon’ their website. These types of pop ups are referred to as ‘exit-intent pop-ups’, which only appear when someone is about to leave the website. They are a great way to capture people that are about to leave your website without giving you their information. They came to your site because they were interested in your product or service! It’s important to make every attempt to capture their email and follow up to close the sale.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/b2978f31-199c-4cf0-b48f-e98c2e327e66_pasted20image200.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Action Items</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a popup with a compelling offer</li>
<li>Test Ideas</li>
<li>Privy is a FREE pop-up creation tool</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>So now that you heard our top marketing tips, how do they all work together? How can you look at things holistically to get the best results? These channels can all be creatively tweaked to strengthen one another.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that specific messaging is working through your PPC ads, try using that same messaging throughout your emails, Facebook ads, and website to see if your conversion rate increases. Emails collected through popups can be used as retargeting audiences in AdWords or Facebook. There is plenty of room to get creative!</p>

<p>How important is it that your website be mobile-friendly and provide a great user experience right now?</p>
<p>In a word: VERY. Just check the staggering statistics: mobile devices <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.zenithmedia.com/mobile-forecasts-75-internet-use-will-mobile-2017/">account for 80% of global internet usage</a></span> today. This means that the majority of the traffic to your website will almost definitely be mobile users. This also means that it’s more important than ever to provide your visitors with a great mobile web experience.</p>
<p>Having a mobile-optimized website for your business will also pay SEO dividends. Google will also rank your site based on the mobile version as part of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751">mobile first indexation</a></span>.</p>
<p>If your site provides a lackluster mobile experience, then Google will probably rank your site lower in search results. All of the tips I give in this crash course revolve around sending traffic to your website, so make sure that you are providing the best user experience possible. Once you send people to your site, you want them to stay and find what they need there.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/657ea251-b58f-482b-87b0-4a94de0ec1ed_bigstock-222069088.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Using Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is through the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">responsive</span> web design.</p>
<p>What is responsive web design? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/">Smashing Magazine</a></span> defines it as, “the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.”</p>
<p>In other words, when you’re designing responsively, you’re designing a website to fit any device it’s rendered on, as opposed to the more old-fashioned practice of creating separate websites for desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>For SEO purposes, it’s important to note that<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/">Google has openly endorsed the responsive design approach</a></span>. So, if you want to rank higher in online searches, this is a good thing to keep in mind.</p>
<p>In my experience, I’ve seen an incredible increase (in one case, even 100%+ increase) in mobile leads when we re-designed homepages to better cater to mobile users.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here’s an example, before optimizing for mobile:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/b5eb71ed-ecfb-4a0f-9eca-9ccdf6948583_warriors-heart-before.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">After re-designing with responsive design:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/5c2ea74c-06b6-4246-a96a-c60376b520b1_warriors-heart-after.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can see they look quite different, and the “After” shot is much more friendly to users navigating from their smartphones.</p>
<p>The message is clear: a great mobile experience for users is incredibly important to your overall digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to necessarily be a complete redesign, just be sure to have the important information readily available to a mobile user: Phone number, contact button, store hours etc. Take a look at your mobile homepage and ask yourself if it’s easy to use or find the information a potential user would be looking for.</p>
<h2>Responsive Design Action Items</h2>
<p>If you haven’t yet migrated your business website, now is the time. Here are some actions you can take right away to get the ball rolling and start moving your web presence toward a more user-friendly experience. If you do, you should be rewarded with happier customers, better search rankings, and more sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Run a speed test</a></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">Run a mobile friendly test</a></span></li>
<li>Make sure there is a clear &#8216;call to action&#8217; on mobile. (Examples of calls to action could be, “Call Now” or, “Get a FREE Quote!”)</li>
<li>Go through your mobile site and experience it as a user. Notice what’s difficult to find or do and consider how to make it more pleasant, then work with your web developer or designer to implement those insights.</li>
</ul>

<p>In running a digital agency, Geek Powered Studios, we’ve tried countless strategies to achieve our clients goals. In our experience, there are a few things that have emerged as the foundation for all our campaigns, no matter what type of business our client is in.</p>
<p>One of the most important tools you can use as a small business owner is not particularly new, yet many marketers are still not using it to their advantage. That tool is email marketing automation. Used correctly, email marketing automation can help you create an unbeatable machine and take your business to the next level, whether you&#8217;re a local service-based company, or a international e-commerce company.</p>
<h2>Email Automation is Easier Than You Think</h2>
<p>Email automation is an incredibly easy way to maximize the opportunity of converting a prospect into a customer. I’m sure there have been many instances where you’ve experienced someone fill out a contact form, then never answer their email.</p>
<p>Automated emails are a great way to win them back and start a conversation. Here’s how they work: Once you get a customer&#8217;s email, you can set up an automated campaign that will trigger a series of emails. Your automation provider sends those emails to the customer over a period of time that you determine.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to create an email cadence that roughly reflects your customer’s buying cycle. (For example, larger purchases require more time, so it’s ok to schedule 5 emails over a 6 month period.)</p>
<p>Emails are probably the highest ROI channel you can use. For every $1 you spend on email marketing, you can expect<a href="http://emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf">an average return of $38</a></span>. The best thing about this channel is its accessibility: there are many providers to choose from, at reasonable prices. Both<a href="https://mailchimp.com/pricing/free/"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://mailchimp.com/pricing/free/">the tool and the automation are free with Mailchimp</a></span>.</p>
<h2>How to Build a Great Email Sequence</h2>
<p>Sometimes, just getting started with a new tool or communication channel can be daunting. I like to map out my communications with a simple outline, then fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple email sequence that could apply to many different types of businesses. You can use this example to get started, then customize it to fit your business and customers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email 1</span> (Sends as soon as they complete the form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your company</li>
<li>Speak to how long you’ve been in business</li>
<li>What makes you unique to your competitors?</li>
<li>What accolades/awards/certifications does your business have?</li>
<li>Include a call to action (CTA) at the end of the email to book an appointment, consultation, or something else. Always remember to include some next action that you want that customer to take.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email 2</span> (automatically sends after 1 &#8211; 3 days and previous email was sent)</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your services</li>
<li>What are the different services you offer</li>
<li>What problems do your services solve?</li>
<li>Include a CTA with an offer or promo that is exclusive to the email</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Email 3 </span>(automatically sends after 1-3 days of previous email being sent.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Special discount or promo</li>
<li>Make it time sensitive with an expiration</li>
<li>Make the coupon exclusive and only available through this email</li>
</ul>
<h2>Even More Ways to Use Email</h2>
<p>Once you start thinking about email marketing, you’ll find the possibilities are nearly endless.</p>
<p>You can send one-off campaigns for many different occasions or reasons. For example, you can ask for customer reviews, announce new services, or celebrate a holiday with something special like an event in your store, a virtual event online, or a “secret” VIP discount.</p>
<p>All of these initiatives rely on email to communicate them, and can help you stay top-of-mind with your past customers.</p>
<p>Keeping a well curated list of your customers within Mailchimp or another email provider will also serve you well as you layer on Facebook ads. Facebook will allow you to upload those emails and target people similar to you best customers. This is a great way to expand your reach and generate new ones.</p>

<h2>Example: Getting Customer Feedback</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a dead-simple automated email that goes to customers. In this example, we’ll show an email we sent to a roofing company customer of ours.</p>
<p>We created this using a review tool that automatically sends a customer an email when they are added to the email list. The email asks them to rate their experience and anything rated 7 or above triggers an email sent to the client asking them to leave a review online. Any poor ratings go straight to the business owner, so that they can address the issue right away, <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> that upset customer leaves a negative review online.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/6359ce16-6f3a-49ea-bbad-5f9999fc9b99_pasted20image200.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This email can have a significant impact: after receiving it, we&#8217;ve seen approximately 10% of customers leave a review. This has helped business owners tremendously, considering that Google looks at number of reviews as a local SEO ranking signal. Those positive reviews also look great to prospective customers researching businesses on the web.</p>
