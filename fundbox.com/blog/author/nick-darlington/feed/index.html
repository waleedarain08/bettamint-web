In this article, let’s put the confusion to rest.</p>
<p>Before you send anything to your client, understand the details of what they want, like cost expectations, desired services or past client testimonials and recommendations.</p>
<p>If you fail to get crisp on what your client expects, you run the risk of giving them the wrong information and stalling the process.</p>
<p>While open to interpretation, an estimate, bid, quote, and proposal are meaningfully different. There are widely accepted definitions that hold true across industries. It’s these definitions we explore in this post to put some of the confusion to bed.</p>
<p>Let’s jump in.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s an Estimate?</span></h2>
<p>As the name suggests, an estimate is an approximation of what things will cost.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/estimating-software">Estimates</a></span> help you determine costs and assist clients with budgeting. They’re usually drafted without an in-depth understanding of the client’s requirements and are subject to change as new information surfaces (that contractor estimate can get blown when they discover asbestos or old wiring, for example).</p>
<p>But estimates don’t only detail costs. They provide a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/project-estimates">high-level overview</a></span> of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The services you’ll provide so clients understand the work you will complete</li>
<li>Project scope, so clients understand broadly what each service entails</li>
<li>Timelines and completion dates to manage client expectations</li>
<li>Exclusions to avoid disputes later on</li>
<li>Other specific terms that the client should know if they want to do business with you</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s a Quote?</span></h2>
<p>Unlike an estimate, a quote provides a fixed price for a project subject to a specific time frame. Ever seen a quote that reads “Valid for 30 days?” Sure you have.</p>
<p>In many industries, companies will have these terms to protect themselves. For example, if you have your own cake business you know that the price of the ingredients can fluctuate from one day to the next.</p>
<p>Regardless, once the customer accepts the quote you have to complete the work as detailed in the quote and at that price. For this reason, you&#8217;ll want to compile a quote with a thorough understanding of what the client wants. In this way, you&#8217;ll be able to go into detail about the services, exclusions, timelines and the project scope.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s a Bid?</span></h2>
<p>Bids are common where the scope of work is clear. For example, think of a government agency looking for suitable contractors to complete a project. They will detail what they need and make these requirements available.</p>
<p>Companies will then bid for these projects by specifying how much it will cost to complete the project. The agency will then choose a winner among the many bids.</p>
<p>A bid will have more detail than estimates and quotes. While Bids and proposals are similar, proposals usually have more detail.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s a Proposal?</span></h2>
<p>You’re probably familiar with the following scenarios: A client asks you to send a pitch after a client meeting and you get shortlisted. Now, they want you to compete for their business and ask for an estimate, but instead, you go the extra mile and show off your real value.</p>
<p>In each of these scenarios, you&#8217;ll, invariably, create a proposal. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/freshbooks-proposals">Proposals</a></span> include all the information contained in estimates, quotes and bids. But they take things further by showcasing the value that you can offer a prospective client and including testimonials and examples of past work to establish trust.</p>
<p>Specifically, they detail project scope, timelines, deliverables, and costs (or investment). They’re specific and not an approximation.</p>
<p>They’re usually put together to win a client&#8217;s business at the start of a new relationship. When you submit a proposal, you&#8217;ll often do so in competition with several other companies. As a result, it&#8217;s essential that you take time to construct an excellent proposal and showcase value.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Estimates, quotes, bids, and proposals are different, despite the overlap between these documents.</p>
<p>It’s important that when you submit any of these to a client, you take the time to understand what they&#8217;re expecting to receive. Why? So that when you’re asked to deliver a quote, you’re not delivering it based on what you think, but on what the clients want. This should prevent confusion and make life easier for you and your clients.</p>

After all, you’re a professional and your time is money, and you should always, always, always charge for your work!</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you <span style="font-style: italic;">won’t</span> ever be asked to work for free. Sometimes you might even be tempted. It could look like a dream client and a good way to get your foot in the door. Or it could be a valuable existing client who keeps pushing for more, and you’re worried about losing a lucrative account.</p>
<p>In these cases, a simple “no” might feel a bit abrupt. You don’t want to burn bridges, after all. So how do you stop clients from expecting free work, without jeopardizing your relationship with them? Let’s have a look.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">With New Clients: State Your Policy, But Also Your Value </span></h2>
<p>You get an email from a prospective client. Your heart starts racing when you realize it’s dream work for a client you’re dying to work for. But the catch: They can’t pay you. Maybe they promise “exposure” or even hint this might be the start of more…</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>It helps to have a template response to requests to work for free (and to spend some time thinking about your own policy). You might, for example, decide you will do a certain amount of free work for not-for-profits as a give-back to your community.</p>
<p>But when a large commercial client asks you to work for free, it’s worth having a standard response that asserts your rates. This <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www2.freshbooks.com/Awkward-Conversations-Guide-for-Small-Business-Owners-ebook">e-book from FreshBook</a></span>s has some starting points (for this conversation and others).</p>
<p>But don’t leave it there. Explain the value of your work not just in terms of what it costs, but in terms of what it delivers for them. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank you for reaching out! I would love to work with you on this project.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My policy is to do free work for not-for-profit organizations, but for businesses like yours, I always charge for my work. I’ve attached my rate card/estimate for your information. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">What will you get in return? You can expect stellar [assets] that drive outstanding [results] for your business. Similar work I did for [clients X, Y, Z] yielded [quantified results].</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">With Existing Clients: Set Expectations from the Start</span></h2>
<p>Early and often is the rule of thumb for managing your clients’ expectations. Think of it as training: On the first few projects you take on with a new client,  be a tyrant about scope creepy requests.</p>
<p>This is where strong documentation can help. Set yourself up to make this easy by providing a clear estimate or proposal from the start of every new request or project. That way, when they ask for something more, it’s clear whether the item is covered in that scope of work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/project-estimates">Project estimates</a></span> help you take the guesswork out of client relationships. They provide a breakdown of services, costs and project length. More importantly, they kickstart good practices and ensure everyone grasps the work involved.</p>
<p>Be diplomatic to preserve the relationship. Take a moment to explain the time and resources it would take to complete their request so they understand it in clear dollars and cents.  This way they feel like they have a choice in the matter and can either agree to fork out or forgo the request.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making Exceptions: Don’t Nickel and Dime a Good Relationship</span></h2>
<p>While charging for work is important, it’s equally important to identify when offering a freebie might be advantageous.</p>
<p>You want to build lasting, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/build-great-client-relationships/">positive client relationships</a></span>. You don’t want your clients to think you’re someone who quibbles over every penny. So, be reasonable, maintain a long-term view, and be willing to let things slide. Consider that sometimes you stand to gain more in the long term from that interaction—that single freebie or favor—than you would from the initial monetary benefit.</p>
<p>One practical way to execute this and show your generous spirit in the name of building that relationship (but make it clear a charge would normally apply) is to add a discount to your invoice.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving a loyal client a freebie. But it becomes problematic when the client starts expecting it. And, if you’re not careful you may find yourself doing massive amounts of “free” work with no money to show for your efforts.</p>
<p>Failure to correct this situation may lead to resentment. And that’s not fun. Thankfully, fixing the situation is easy, and you don’t have to burn bridges with the client. Just take charge and train them to stop expecting it.</p>
<p>Do you have clients who expect free work? How do you deal with it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>We hope you don&#8217;t need these, but if things get out of hand, here are some tips to help you <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/break-client-grace/">break up with a client</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_589370666-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Small business owner considering a new project" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_589370666-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_589370666.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>As an experienced business owner will know, saying <span style="font-style: italic;">yes</span> to every single opportunity that crosses your path can result in disaster.</p>
<p>But judging when to say <span style="font-style: italic;">no</span> can be fraught with what-if second-guessing. To make it easier to separate wheat from chaff, here are four questions to ask yourself before deciding whether to take on a new project.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Does the project enhance my portfolio?</span></h2>
<p>There are two ways you can enhance your portfolio: Through association or the type of work.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enhancement through association: </span>Have you ever visited a website that says “As seen in [insert publication]?” Sure you have. Clients and projects that can give you this social proof may be worth working for.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enhancement by type of work: </span>You likely specialize in a service or a range of services. By tackling client work that’s related to your core service you enhance your portfolio and demonstrate you can deliver on that service.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Will I be able to charge what I’m worth?</span></h2>
<p>Many business owners make the mistake of jumping all over new projects without truly understanding how much time it will take them to complete it.</p>
<p>So, get clear on how much time you’ll spend on the project by defining the scope of work. Then, once you understand what the work entails, ask yourself: Is the money I’m <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/billing-blind-spots">getting worth</a></span> the time?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Is there long-term potential?</span></h2>
<p>Many small business owners undersell themselves just to get a foot in the door. They agree to work at a reduced rate (and in some cases even for free) especially if it’s their dream client.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how reputable you believe the client to be; you should always evaluate the long-term potential of a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there potential for more work?</li>
<li>Is this a once off or will there be recurring projects?</li>
<li>If this is a once off, will it benefit me?</li>
</ul>
<p>One-off projects can benefit you when you’re starting your business and need social proof. But constantly relying on them means you’ll always have to hustle for new business which can cause cash flow problems.</p>
<p>So, it’s wise to get a few <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/3-ways-to-find-and-land-anchor-clients">anchor clients</a></span> who can guarantee you a certain amount of income each month.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. What is my gut telling me?</span></h2>
<p>Have you ever felt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncomfortable promoting a specific brand (maybe you don’t believe in the brand, or their values clash with yours)?</li>
<li>Apprehensive about the type of work the client wants you to do?</li>
<li>Uneasy when talking to a specific client (you can’t quite put your finger on it, but something doesn’t feel right?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is your gut talking. Everyone will have different gut feelings, but it’s important that you tune into your gut when tackling any new project. Your gut is a powerful thing and in my experience rarely wrong.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>It’s often tempting to say yes to every project that comes your way, especially if the money is good. The truth is that not every project is worth pursuing.</p>
<p>But, by asking these four questions and being more selective with the projects you undertake you can avoid these situations.</p>

In America, for instance, according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.bankrate.com/">Bankrate</a></span>, there are 44 million people who have a second job, also known as a &#8220;side hustle.&#8221; These numbers are only set to increase as many realize the power of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gig-economy">gig economy</a></span>.</p>
<p>For many people a side hustle is a mere stepping stone to a more permanent escape from “the cubicle”. They have their sights set on full-time self-employment. If you’re in this boat, it’s even more important to run your side hustle with focus. After all, this is the time when you still have a safety net in place… so make the most of this time to set yourself up for ultimate success.</p>
<p>Here are our top 3 mistakes to avoid when scaling your side hustle:</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Underselling Your Side Hustle Skills<br />
</span></h2>
<p>Many adopt an “It’s all gravy” attitude while running their side gig, and hold back from negotiating the highest possible rates with your clients. It’s easy to fall into this trap. But you’re not doing yourself or your industry any favors. By setting or accepting lower rates, you create the perception that these are the going rates in the industry, making it harder for other professionals.</p>
<p>Besides, if you ever decide to turn that side hustle into a full-time gig, you’re going to have to deal with a “reality bites” rate adjustment to make ends meet!</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Solution:</span></p>
<p>Realize that even though you’re running a side hustle, you can and should set higher rates. Research what the going rates are in the industry and price accordingly (reach out to other professionals in your field to see what they charge).</p>
<p>If you’re scared of setting higher rates, it may be because you lack confidence, but it may also be because you don’t truly understand the value you’re providing. So, get clear on that value (read the book <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/breakingthetimebarrier">Breaking the Time Barrier</a></span>; it’s changed how I view my business).</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Not Separating Business and Personal Finances</span></h2>
<p>If you’re running a side hustle, it’s understandable to use your personal bank accounts. After all, you may be “testing the waters” and not want the hassle of setting up business accounts. But, if you’re increasingly thinking about turning it into a full-time job, you really want to keep finances separate.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you’ll continuously be sifting through bank statement to determine your earnings and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/personal-business-finances">separating business expenses from personal ones</a></span>. Let’s not forget about the actual impact this has on your business by not knowing where all your money is going.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Solution:</span></p>
<p>Spend some time researching the best small business account you can get. Think about the fees associated with transfers to your personal accounts (because for now, that will be your main transaction). But think about how this account can scale with your business too.</p>
<p>As more and more businesses take their transactions online, account fees will also be worth considering.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Tracking Income and Sending Invoices the Wrong Way</span></h2>
<p>Tracking your income correctly is just as crucial for determining your profitability as expense tracking is. Your inclination may be to use what’s familiar (for example, Word or Excel). But there are drawbacks: You spend an awfully long time manually reconciling all the data and don’t have a firm grasp on your income situation. Plus, maintaining accuracy can be a huge challenge.</p>
<p>Dare I mention the old proverb coined by Benjamin Franklin in 1748 that says “Time is Money”? I think so. Time really is money! Because it’s such a valuable resource, we should make an effort to use it wisely. And so, while Excel may seem like the cheaper option, it’s really just a time-suck. There is a better way to track income and send invoices.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The Solution:</span></p>
<p>Invoicing and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/perfect-accounting-software-ebook">accounting has come a long way</a></span>… like so many things there are handy solutions that live on the cloud. A cloud solution prevents any of those little errors from rearing their ugly heads, ever again. It lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effortlessly create beautiful invoices (calculations are made automatically and dates update without you even lifting a finger)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/10-tips-to-get-paid-faster/">Get paid faster</a></span> by accepting online payments – convenient for your client and you! No more waiting for cheques</li>
<li>Set automatic <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/late-payment-fees">late payment reminders and fees</a></span> so you don’t have to deal with the dreaded follow-up</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Optimizing Your Side Hustle<br />
</span></h2>
<p>Optimize your side hustle today for success tomorrow. Then, when you decide to turn it into a full-time job, you’re ready. To do that, prepare for a full-time commitment by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting your price for profitability</li>
<li>Setting some boundaries between personal and professional, starting with finances</li>
<li>Investing in business tools such as cloud accounting software to improve your invoicing and expense tracking</li>
</ul>
