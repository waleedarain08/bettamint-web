Here are some simple ways a small business in any industry can create customer loyalty.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong> Design offers that facilitate repeat purchases<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Your customers may have been completely satisfied with their first or second purchase, but it&#8217;s up to you to give them a reason to keep buying. At least once a month, review sales history at the customer level, taking variables like seasonality, price, promotions, and competitor activity into account. Experiment with targeted marketing offers based on the customer&#8217;s purchase behavior to closely replicate the factors that first brought them to your business. Review service policies—including business hours, inventory levels, and &#8220;concierge-style&#8221; services like free shipping and delivery or private shopping events—regularly to confirm that they&#8217;re competitive with other options the customer has, and are conducive to his or her wants.</p>
<p>Steve Silberberg, owner of Fitpacking Weight Loss Backpacking Adventures, has found success rewarding past customers with an offer ranging in value from $100 to $700 off a future trip—even when it means being less aggressive with his acquisition strategy. &#8220;We believe in rewarding our good customers, not giving huge incentives to strangers. Over 40% of our participants are returning participants, so we think that speaks highly of our loyalty program.&#8221;</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Think beyond the sale<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Shift your marketing focus from one based on driving sales to one focused on providing enhanced value. Todd Damon, president of <a href="http://thisiswoodworking.com/" target="_blank">Wood Werks Supply</a>, Inc., says his family-owned business has flourished for the past 25 years in a retail and e-commerce environments thanks to its focus on customer education. He explains that though because his woodworking business has a history of inviting customers to its showroom to learn and experiment with hundreds of power tools, that model proved invaluable when the business expanded to an online venue. &#8220;The project section on our website where woodworkers can share their stories has been instrumental since we opened an e-commerce store. We&#8217;ve learned that by teaching your customers, they become more loyal to your brand,&#8221; says Damon.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Build customer loyalty by being available<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In a time where virtual assistants, online calendar scheduling, and email communications rule, giving your customers direct access to a live a person is a point of differentiation—even if you&#8217;re a one-man shop. Services like Google Voice can transform your personal cell phone number into a distinct business phone line. Callers will be &#8220;forwarded&#8221; to your cell phone (unbeknownst to them). You can then choose which calls to accept or send to voicemail. Brian Bleifeld, partner at Bleifeld CPA, says his firm stumbled into a unique way to cultivate loyalty through a similar personal touch. &#8220;We&#8217;re near the airport, and 50% of our clients are international. We offer the service of picking them up after a flight, making stops at the bank and law offices, and bringing them back to the airport. It happened by accident the first two times but then became a service. It has helped build loyalty and referrals,&#8221; says Bleifeld.</span></li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Design customer loyalty programs that reward the right behaviors<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>There are now more than three million loyalty programs in the United States, according to <a href="https://www.colloquy.com/latest-news/2015-colloquy-loyalty-census/" target="_blank">data compiled by customer loyalty provider COLLOQUY</a>). But the mere presence of a program doesn&#8217;t mean you have a loyal fan base. (In fact, the same data indicates that though the average person belongs to about 30 loyalty programs, he actively participates in less than a quarter of them). An effective loyalty program is designed with the customer in mind. Consider the tools customers use to communicate and pay, the things they buy regularly (and would appreciate receiving for free or at a discount), along with your average order size, and purchase frequency.</p>
<p>If customers don&#8217;t tend to bring their entire wallet to your business, for example, don&#8217;t require them to present a physical card to earn rewards. If your average order value tends to be small, don&#8217;t set the threshold to earn a reward so high that most customers won&#8217;t reach it. When they do earn rewards, give the customer to option to apply a discount, receive cash back, or a credit to their account, all at the point of sale.</li>

However, the Blue Ocean Strategy takes a different view: Don&#8217;t compete. Instead, create a new marketplace for your business that allows you to write the rules.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the basic premise of Blue Ocean Strategy, and how you can apply it to your small business strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h1><strong>Find your space in the blue ocean—and build your blue ocean strategy.<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/book/" target="_blank"><em>Blue Ocean Strategy</em></a>, written by W.Chan Kim and Renee Maugborgne, was published in 2005 based on studies of 150 strategic business moves that took place over the course of a century. It became an international best-selling business book and was recently updated in 2015. While the strategy is quite complex, the concept is simple: When you identify your business&#8217; &#8220;blue ocean,&#8221; you control your destiny. You don&#8217;t react to moves the competition makes, nor do you position yourself directly against them. You write the rules and exist in an open market space.</p>
<p>Cirque du Soleil is a classic example of Blue Ocean Strategy in practice. It doesn&#8217;t compete with traditional circus acts; it redefined the meaning of a circus experience. Therein lies the value of what Blue Ocean Strategy offers small business owners: You don&#8217;t have to have an idea that&#8217;s never been presented to the market. You present it differently.</p>
<p>With that in mind, apply these questions to inspire your own competitive strategy based on the premise of the Blue Ocean Strategy. (If you do want to execute the Blue Ocean Strategy from start to finish, you can find the best-selling book and <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/bos-question-and-answer/" target="_blank">several interactive tools at the Blue Ocean Strategy official website</a>.)</li>
<li>
<h1><strong>When/where does the customer&#8217;s need for my product or service <em>start</em>?<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>This question can change your customer acquisition strategy to market where your competition isn&#8217;t. Suppose you own a lawn care company, for example. You could market to customers based on events like the purchase of a new home, or the onset of spring. With that strategy, you&#8217;re in a crowded space (known as a &#8220;red ocean&#8221;). Your messaging is reactive, based on where the competition markets. Look deeper into the path your customer takes to purchase, however, and you may find your blue ocean.</p>
<p>Consider this example: the purchase of a new home as a trigger for lawn care service needs. In a red ocean strategy, you market to the customer shortly after they buy the home (right alongside your competitors). A blue ocean strategy identifies the events that happen <em>before </em>they customer knows they have a need. In turn, it reveals different points of entry. For example, a realtor works with both buyers and sellers, guiding them on the maintenance required to make the home appealing to buyers (like lawn care). A person searching online real estate sites for a home to buy may also have property they need to prepare for sale. Market your services at these points, and you&#8217;re in acquisition channels your competitors aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>When Southwest Airlines strategically positioned itself as an alternative to car travel by promoting affordable pricing and lack of typical airline industry &#8220;frills&#8221;, it stopped competing directly with other airlines and invented a blue ocean of its own.</li>
<li>
<h1><strong>How does my customer experience what I sell from start to finish?<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>Understanding the intimate details of the customer experience can reveal mutually beneficial changes for your business and its customer. Consider how your customer currently moves through your purchase funnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they find information about product, services, and suppliers?</li>
<li>How do they receive a price quote or estimate, then compare prices and payment options?</li>
<li>How do they move from initial interest to purchase? Do they have to call, meet with a rep, order online, or wait for an item to ship?</li>
<li>What interruptions or inconveniences do they encounter?</li>
<li>Is the interaction over once they receive their item? Do they want it to be?Once you investigate the details of the customer&#8217;s reality, you can use it for further exploration.</li>
<li>How is your detailed process similar to and different from competitors? Which factors, based on your exploration, appear to be the most &#8220;ripe&#8221; for elimination, creation, or change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take those ideas in front of your customers and noncustomers for feedback. Based on their insights, create two process maps: Your current customer experience, and the proposed one. Compare them to identify where gaps and opportunities for identifying your own blue ocean might exist. For example, changing pricing may not be viable, but a process improvement that reduces your costs and improves customer satisfaction might work.</li>
<li>
<h1><strong>What hurdle can I remove?<br />
</strong></h1>
<p>In <em>Blue Ocean Strategy, </em>the authors point out a truth often underestimated in small business strategy: &#8220;Industry structure can always be reshaped by the players in it.&#8221; Consider how companies like Zappos, Warby Parker, and Saleforce addressed industry-specific hurdles to create their own blue oceans.</p>
<p>As a small business, you have the advantage of agility, and the freedom to research and rally the resources you need to minimize customer pain points. Kim and Mauborgne recommend businesses identify six &#8220;utility levers&#8221; to discover hurdles that, if removed, could lead to a blue ocean: customer productivity, simplicity, convenience, risk, fun/image, and environmental friendliness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to social media, the Internet, and online review sites, customers now have a louder voice than ever before. Make their life just a bit better, and they&#8217;ll help you spread the word.</p>

Though a presence at events like farmer&#8217;s markets, festivals, and similar functions are a fun way to reach audiences you otherwise wouldn&#8217;t, they may require a new approach to your selling strategy.<br />
Here are a few ways to ensure that your business achieves the best possible return on investment at summer events.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Know the audience you want to reach</strong></h2>
<p>Involving your business in summer events is only valuable to your bottom line if it connects you with target customers. Before you commit to a summer event, ask event organizers for specific information, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expected attendance based on previous years</li>
<li>The event marketing strategy to attract visitors and exhibitors</li>
<li>Demographics of the community in which the event is held</li>
<li>A list of past exhibitors as well as those who are committed to exhibit again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, reach out to past event participants who may be willing to share, based on their goals, their experience about whether an event provided an adequate return on investment.<br />
Establish metrics and well-defined objectives for what you hope to get out of marketing at summer events before you plan an exhibitor schedule, and conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the events you consider. For example, popular events with a long history can deliver more certainty about attendance compared to those in their infancy, but may have higher participation costs, more competition, and regulations about booth sizes, signage, products you can display, and even whether you have to hire union labor to set up and dismantle your booth. While less-established events tend to be inexpensive, consider costs associated with travel and lodging.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Plan to market in advance of the summer events</strong></h2>
<p>The location-based, real-time nature of social media makes it a perfect medium to market your summer event schedule. Allow yourself time and a marketing budget to build a buzz before each event you&#8217;ll attend with these tactics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer incentives.</strong>Sweepstakes, drawings for free gift cards, and product giveaways can encourage new users to follow you on social media—and existing fans to engage with your posts. Use #hashtags specific to each summer event to organize your posts. Tag the event&#8217;s social media handle in your posts to encourage cross-promotion with event organizers and other exhibitors.</li>
<li><strong>Target your most likely prospects. </strong>Sponsored social media ads allow you to reach a well-defined audience at an affordable cost. For example, with paid Facebook ads you can specify your daily budget, audience, the goal of your sponsored message, and duration of the campaign in accordance with your summer event schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Use videos and images. </strong>Aspirational videos that associate your brand with the theme and tone of the summer events you&#8217;ll attend can be an entertaining way to creatively tell the story of your business and its presence at a particular event. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videorama-video-editor-movie/id1049690233?mt=8" target="_blank">Videorama</a> is one affordable app that allows you to add, text, logos, soundtracks, and other aesthetics to videos you shoot on a mobile device—and they make it easy to upload the finished product to social media platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Leverage the tools that make selling easy</strong></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;re at the event, you need to be armed to sell remotely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accept mobile payments</strong>. Turn your smartphone or tablet into a credit card processing tool with mobile payments. Mobile payment providers like Square and Stripe charge a nominal fee (usually based on the amount of the transaction) to securely process credit or debit cards on your mobile device using the payment provider&#8217;s app or a small card reader that plugs into the headphone jack. Customer receipts are emailed or sent via text message. Funds are usually transferred to your business bank account within 72 hours of transaction approval to help your business cash flow remain intact (especially when summer events take you out of town).</li>
<li><strong>Actively drive booth traffic.</strong> Invest in branded, functional freebies you can pass out at your booth to turn attendees into promoters. (Think reusable shopping bags, branded water bottles, handheld fans, or balloons for kids).Creative demonstrations can also create interest around your booth during the event to attract visitors and engage customers in conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>1. Give them tangible educational value</strong></h2>
<p>Today&#8217;s college students are expected to be able to demonstrate their worth to potential employers with tangible proof of their skills and the results of their efforts, backed by real-world experience. In tandem, the Gallup poll &#8220;How Millennials Want to Work and Live&#8221; reveals that millennials (those born between 1980 and 1996) are interested in work that extends beyond a title or bullet point on their resume: The opportunity to learn and develop is one of the most important aspects they consider when accepting (or leaving) a job. This attraction to continuing education and breadth of knowledge is a competitive advantage small business owners can leverage to attract college interns and recent grads, especially when you can&#8217;t compensate like a larger employer.</p>
<p>Find out what skills your potential employees want to develop, and how you can support their education in those areas. Pay for your interns and recent grads to complete reputable webinars and online learning courses. You could also and potentially pay for them to attend professional workshops designed to further develop their skills and practical knowledge. For a few hundred dollars (which may also be a tax-deductible business expense), you can provide younger hires tangible knowledge and development opportunities and build a reputation as a small business owner with a commitment to developing young talent. Jordan Wan, founder/CEO of sales recruiting platform <a href="https://closeriq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloserIQ</a> says he recently tripled the size of his team by marketing the training and development his company could offer recruits. &#8220;In today&#8217;s competitive war on talent, not many startups can afford to pay for these,&#8221; says Wan.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Act as a mentor to your summer interns</strong></h2>
<p>As more colleges offer entrepreneurship as a topic of study, small business ownership is the primary goal for many college students, not a dream they hope to aspire to after they&#8217;ve spent time in corporate America. Appeal to future entrepreneurs by sharing what you know. Include the fact that you will actively mentor employees and interns in your job descriptions, pay for attendance at networking opportunities, and provide hands-on exposure and interaction with the many functions and tasks running a business entails. The hands-on experience and social connections you can provide a budding entrepreneur early in their career is a valuable benefit worth promoting.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand your company in the channels your top recruits frequent</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;We have found that traditional recruiting methods, such as career fairs and job boards, aren&#8217;t as effective in recruiting students and recent graduates,&#8221; says Allison Hernandez, managing partner at marketing agency <a href="http://www.lotus823.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lotus 823</a>. &#8220;Instead, we use social media to offer unique content on skills we look for in candidates, along with content about office culture and employee growth.&#8221; Hernandez says her firm also uses local university event calendars to engage college students and staff on social media. For example, they use trending hashtags about college sports and events to post relevant social media content and to identify and interact with online influencers, including college students, professors, and college organizations. &#8220;It has been extremely cost-efficient, and we&#8217;ve cut down on dollars we would normally spend in advertising on LinkedIn or securing spots at multiple career fairs,&#8221; says Hernandez. Perhaps most importantly, she says that the quality of submitted resumes has improved immensely.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Promote your culture to current and potential summer interns</strong></h2>
<p>Though Gallup&#8217;s millennial research reveals that the perceived importance younger workers place on informal dress codes and office perks like video games and pool tables may have been overstated in the media, it does confirm millennials care about an engaging workplace culture. Marissa Letendre of Right Recruit says small business owners can promote their environment with authentic feedback from staff. &#8220;Ask employees to create video testimonials about what it is like to work at your business. Create an additional page on your website to feature your culture and office perks along with testimonials and opportunities; it&#8217;s low-cost and can really have a high return,&#8221; says Letendre. She also recommends inviting employees to share their feedback about your company on popular employer review sites: &#8220;Many candidates (especially younger candidates like interns/recent grads) are researching companies on Glassdoor before even applying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuart McClure, founder and CMO of online deal finding startup <a href="https://www.lovethesales.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Love the Sales</a> says he&#8217;s attracted summer interns and recent college grads to his company with flexible workplace hours and perks that make a younger employee&#8217;s life a little easier. &#8220;Interns have very little money. We always cover their travel and food costs so they can focus purely on their work with a positive mindset without the stress of worrying if they can afford to get to the office,&#8221; says McClure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_421088650-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="marketing strategy" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_421088650-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_421088650.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>The spring season is commonly associated with ideas many entrepreneurs are inherently drawn to, including new beginnings and growth. Regardless of your product or service, leveraging some common spring themes in your marketing strategy can help remind existing customers of all your business has to offer and generate new interest among prospects.</p>
<p>Here are four ways to harness the power of spring in your marketing strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Breathe new life into a proven product</strong></h2>
<p>You don’t have to launch a new product or service to market your business with a spring-themed message. Instead, consider spring as an opportunity to breathe new life into how you present staple products. Start by making a list of your top 3–5 most popular items or services. Note the product/service features that have most contributed to each item’s success. Then, brainstorm how you might tout those particular selling features to position the product in a new light as part of a spring campaign. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to your most influential customers (which may be local influencers, other small business owners, or customers with a larger social media following). Ask them to describe one or two specific benefits they experienced from the product that changed their life in some small way, which can include saving them time, money, or reducing stress. Feature one new customer testimonial on your website for each day or week of spring, selecting testimonials that specifically communicate how your product or service provided a “fresh start.”</li>
<li>Incorporate spring hues into online images of your products, in fonts, or on product packaging. (Check out the <a href="http://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2016">color palette associated with 2016’s Pantone colors Rose Quartz and Serenity</a> for inspiration).</li>
<li>Test different approaches to sales copy on your website; incorporate the search terms people use most often to find the product into marketing headlines and product descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>2. Create a community</strong></h2>
<p>The warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours of spring tend to inspire people to get out of their homes and into their communities. Leverage this aspect of the spring season to cultivate engagement on social media and form a sense of community for your business. Bryan Clayton, CEO of lawn care company <a href="http://www.yourgreenpal.com/">GreenPal</a>, says his company has found success with an annual “Best Looking Lawn Contest” held in the spring. “We have homeowners share pictures of their freshly mowed lawn. We judge which is the best looking and award a free lawn cut every week. It generates all kinds of shares on social media and word-of-mouth buzz in the five cities that we operate,” says Clayton.</p>
<p>You can also promote a sense of community by partnering with other small business owners to host a spring sidewalk event or community “meet and greet.” When you team up with other business owners to hold a special event in the spring, you can help to cross-promote one another’s products, move old or unwanted inventory as part of “spring cleaning,” chat with your customers face to face, and even use the event to generate buzz in your local media.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Make yourself relevant to the customer’s mindset</strong></h2>
<p>Struggling to correlate your business with the spring season? Create content that’s relevant to issues the customer has top of mind during the spring season. Your marketing strategy may not drive immediate sales, but they can still offer value by creating brand awareness, driving traffic to your website, and boosting your social media presence. Darren Green, founder of Roman Blinds Direct, plays up the spring season and drives traffic to his website with a weekly <a href="http://www.roman-blinds-direct.co.uk/blog/beinspired/">inspiration page</a> on his company’s blog that offers spring-inspired interior decorating tips.</p>
<p>If you own a fitness facility, for example, you might engage clients with a daily healthy recipe on social media that suggests ways clients can cook with locally grown produce. If you own a daycare facility, share ideas parents can use to encourage kids to play outdoors and learn about nature. Nearly any business can attach itself to a spring theme, provided you understand what your customers care about during the season and are willing to put in the effort to develop a relevant campaign.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Align your business with a spring holiday (or two)</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to well-known annual spring events like graduation and Mother’s Day, there’s a good chance you can find at least one spring event that’s relevant to your customer, or the values you’ve built your business upon. Below is a list of just some of the upcoming celebratory days that will take place this spring. Perhaps one will inspire a new idea you can leverage to promote your business!</p>
<ul>
<li>May 21: Armed Forces Day</li>
<li>May 23: Victoria Day</li>
<li>May 24:National Brother Day</li>
<li>May 28: National Burger Day</li>
<li>May 30: Memorial Day</li>
<li>May 31: World No Tobacco Day</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_415023838-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="small business strategy" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_415023838-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/shutterstock_415023838.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>There’s no need to overhaul your operations to make improvements to efficiency, employee engagement, revenue, brand identity, and growth potential. As these seven business owners demonstrate, you may be one small shift away from a better business strategy.</p>
<h2><strong>Small Business Strategy #1: &#8220;I</strong><strong> abandoned the traditional two-week payroll.&#8221; </strong></h2>
<p>Rewriting the &#8220;norms&#8221; of corporate America can empower you to build a startup culture with a unique brand identity, and improve your ability to attract and retain top talent. When AJ Saleem, owner of <a href="https://www.suprexlearning.com/">Suprex Learning</a>, moved from a traditional biweekly payroll to one that compensated salaried employees weekly and hourly employees daily, his team (many are younger millennials) became more positive, motivated and productive. By compensating them quickly, his staff were better equipped to pay their own bills, and feel less stressed. &#8220;In addition, employees are more likely to work extra hours; they know they will have the money in their bank accounts the next day,&#8221; says Saleem.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #2: </strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>I raised my rates.&#8221; </strong></h2>
<p>Your business needs revenue, but it’s also important to attract the customers who allow you to command a profit margin that allows you to produce quality work. <a href="http://www.danielnainan.com/">Dan Nainan</a>, a professional comedian who has performed for President Obama and various TED conferences, was inspired by that realization when he decided to raise his rates well beyond the standard for his profession. &#8220;To be sure, I lost work when I walked away from lower-paying gigs, but I also realized those clients were also the most difficult to deal with and wasted a lot of my time. By raising my rates, I&#8217;ve more than made up for any lost shows,&#8221; says Naianan. Since commanding his worth, he has branded himself as a performer worth the cost and even earned a testimonial from President Obama.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #3: </strong>&#8220;I created a distraction-free environment.&#8221;</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Multi-tasking may seem unavoidable when you’re a time-pressed small business owner, but it puts you in a constant state of reactivity and inefficiency. About a year ago, Bill Corbett, Jr. of <a href="http://www.corbettpr.com/">Corbett Public Relations</a> set out to conquer this problem by scheduling blocks of time each day to work in a distraction-free environment. He wears noise-cancelling headphones and eliminates all points of distraction, including emails, social media, phone calls, text messages, and meetings. &#8220;These focused periods have allowed me to get significant amounts of work done. I plan more effectively and my staff learns how to rely on me less often. My business has grown since I started this system,&#8221; says Corbett, Jr.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #4: </strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>We established an objective system to measure and reward success.&#8221; </strong></h2>
<p>Hiring and retaining employees can be a challenge for small business owners. Employees may wear many proverbial hats, making it difficult to gauge whether their compensation is reflective of their performance or whether their outputs are aligned with what they earn. Michael O’Donnell says his business <a href="http://www.cavetools.com">Cave Tools</a> transformed when he implemented grading system that objectively measures each employee’s contribution to a specific and critical business goal and rewards a bonus to those who achieve it. By using a key performance indicator (KPI) each week, he says each employee knows the milestone they need to achieve to receive a 15% bonus. &#8220;This performance-driven system puts the onus of responsibility on the employees, and I don’t care if they work 30 hours a week or 50 hours a week. It’s up to them to achieve their KPIs; it’s my job to provide enough managerial support so they can get their bonus,&#8221; says O’Donnell.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #5: </strong>&#8220;I started hosting product giveaways on my blogs.&#8221; </strong></h2>
<p>Lisa Chu of kids apparel shop <a href="http://www.blacknbianco.com">Black N Bianco</a> says that while bloggers have always been a vital component to her marketing strategy, hosting product giveaways on blogs proved to be a game-changer. &#8220;That small change from product review to giveaway brought in triple the amount of web traffic; user engagement increased by fifty percent.&#8221; She adds that because customers who won the items wrote detailed and genuine product reviews, this small strategy shift also helped boost brand credibility.</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #7: </strong>&#8220;</strong><strong>I stopped automated marketing and focused on making personal connections.&#8221; </strong></h2>
<p>Automating marketing campaigns allows you to consistently stay in touch with your target audience, but you may need to work harder to convince prospects that you’re a business they can trust. This proved to be the case for small business marketing coach Tim Rich, who made the strategic decision to move away from automated marketing to focus on building trust through free education and advice. &#8220;It took the pressure away from selling. Almost all of these personal encounters converted to a paying client,&#8221; says Rich. &#8220;Automated marketing is fine if you have a huge volume of prospective customers, but when your footfall is low, you have to treat each face as a friend and a partner.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong><strong>Small Business Strategy #7: </strong>&#8220;I was working too much in my business and not enough on my business.&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>CEO isn’t supposed to mean &#8220;Chief Everything Officer,&#8221; but Molly MacDonald was in that role with her startup <a href="http://www.themobilelockerco.com/">The Mobile Locker Co</a>. &#8220;I knew our revenue couldn’t support additional full-time salaries, but handling everything from marketing to accounting to sales to onsite operations was running me down,&#8221; says MacDonald. She outsourced a couple of hours of administrative work each week to a virtual assistant, and contracted a booking specialist for four hours a week to focus on sales. &#8220;Suddenly, the company was running a lot smoother and we started to make big steps toward securing solid business. I’m now able to invest more of my time into planning for growth, which is essential to our success,&#8221; says MacDonald.</p>

Despite the choices, the process of selecting the program or application that best fits your business can be overwhelming, and you might opt to stick with your current processes instead of facing analysis paralysis or decision fatigue.</p>
<p>If this dilemma sounds familiar, read on. Every product on this list has proven invaluable to an entrepreneur who had the need to give their business a fresh start and found a solution by adopting one of these solutions.</p>
<p>Regardless of your industry, there’s a good chance that at least one of the tools mentioned below will breathe new life into your business.</p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>An efficient way to communicate with clients, staff, and vendors</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>1. <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/get-latest-office-365-for-your-business-with-2016-visit-office?WT.mc_id=PS_Google_O365SMB_office%20365&amp;Dimension=&amp;WT.srch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office 365</a></strong></h2>
<p>With business plans starting at $5 a month for each user, Danita Harris, CEO of Rated M Wine Infused Foods, says Office 365 has helped her streamline internal communications, and better manage her own schedule.&#8221;Office 365 allows me to schedule an appointment within an email and also create notes and follow-up reminders. Its intranet feature (called One Drive) allows me to upload information I need to share with my team to the same system they use to log in to for their email. I can also give them access to upload shared projects, making us all more zefficient,&#8221; says Harris. (Though still in beta, <a href="https://cloud.open365.io/applogin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open 365</a> is a free, open-source platform styled after the Office 365 product).</p>
<h2><strong>2. <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack</a></strong></h2>
<p>Makenzie Marzluff of Delighted By Hummus says that Slack (a free tool) has relieved her virtual team of the inefficiency associated with back-and-forth email communication. It&#8217;s also made it easier to categorize tasks and keep track of the many moving parts of her business. &#8220;Nothing is lost in email any more. We assign tasks and upload documents all in one place. Plus, we can access it all online, any time,&#8221; says Marzluff. Since her team began using Slack, she says project turnaround time has improved, and all employees (including herself) are more aware of what’s been accomplished and what needs attention at any given time.</p>
<h2><strong>3. <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boomerang</a></strong></h2>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong>This extension for Gmail allows you to schedule when a certain email will be sent out; you can set emails to be boomerangedback to you if there was no reply,&#8221; says Jason Khoo of Ron Wave Design. He says the tool is especially handy when conducting business while traveling, catching up on email late at night, or working on projects with formal timelines you want avoid disrupting. &#8220;For business development, Boomerang also reminds you if someone you are trying to reach hasn&#8217;t responded,&#8221; says Khoo.</p>
<h2><strong>4. <a href="https://www.shiftplanning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShiftPlanning</a></strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses can meet urgent customer needs when armed with the tools that empower them to perform under pressure. Jeff Goodwin, owner of Exactly Maid, has created a responsive business model (despite not having a central location) with the ShiftPlanning app. &#8220;We use ‪it for seamless communication, confirmation of schedules, and late bookings. It pays for itself many times over by providing ease of scheduling and allowing for communication with employees about open projects. We also use it to confirm availability and completed work. It&#8217;s literally been a lifesaver,&#8221; says Goodwin.</p>

<h2><strong>1. <a href="https://www.mautic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mautic</a></strong></h2>
<p>This open-source marketing automation platform maintains the functionality of tools you may already use, such as Hubspot and Marketo, while simplifying how you manage and monitor marketing campaigns on social media, email, and online. (It even allows you to create customized drip campaigns for free). Alan Blashaw, co-founder of EquityOwl, says he has found the tool to be user-friendly and intuitive while also easily integrating with existing marketing tools: &#8220;While we still use Mailchimp for a number of our email programs, Mautic [which integrates with Mailchimp] is great for automating many of the tasks/campaigns that we’ve traditionally had to do manually.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>2. <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MarsEdit 3</a></strong></h2>
<p>As a blogger who is blind, Max Ivey relies on this blog editing software to craft and publish blog posts (complete with images and links) using a text editor while working online and offline. &#8220;Being able to create a complete blog post without being online is a big advantage to busy professionals. It’s an easy-to-use format that also gives people who may be intimidated by popular blogger platforms the confidence to manage their own blog,&#8221; says Ivey.</p>
<h2><strong>3. <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuzzSumo</a></strong></h2>
<p>Content marketing with blog posts, social media updates, infographs, and videos can help you reach more customers, but creating content doesn’t guarantee it will get read by those you most want to reach. To get a better sense of what’s &#8220;newsworthy,&#8221; Alex Reichmann, CEO of <a href="https://www.itestcash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTestCash</a>, relies on Buzzsumo&#8217;s tool for real-time inspiration about popular industry stories that are read and shared most often by his target audience.</p>

<h2><strong>1. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stay Focusd</a></strong></h2>
<p>Lori Cheek, founder of Cheekd, says that this Google Chrome extension, which lets you set specific time restrictions on certain websites with a 10-minute default option, helped her become more disciplined about the time she spends online and on social media. &#8220;It’s so easy to get sidetracked when you get a notification from social media or a news site. You think you’ll just read the update, but there’s a world of procrastination opportunities that amount to many wasted minutes of the work&#8221;StayFocusd allows you to determine how much time you’re &#8220;allowed&#8221; to spend daily on each site. Once you’ve exceeded your allocated time, you can’t access the site for the rest of the day.</p>
<h2><strong>2. <a href="https://www.rev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rev.com</a></strong></h2>
<p>For $1 a minute, Jill Schiefelbein, founder of The Dynamic Communicator, says this transcription service, which is accessible from a mobile device, or desktop is accurate, and has fast turnaround times. &#8220;I use this service to get transcripts of client intake calls (I always inform the client of this) so that I can focus on the conversation instead of taking notes. I also record (not write) blog posts and articles, then edit from the transcription,&#8221; says Schiefelbein.</p>
<h2><strong>3. <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonsai</a></strong></h2>
<p>The process of invoicing, collecting payment, and exchanging signed and legally binding service contracts with clients is a necessary aspect of running a business, but the process can be time-consuming. Paige Brunton of The Paige Studio says that the software tool Bonsai has simplified the administrative aspect of running her creative small business without requiring her to cut corners or bear unnecessary legal risk. &#8220;Bonsai offers simple invoicing capabilities and contracts written by lawyers that are easily customizable. My clients don&#8217;t need to go find a working printer or fax machine when they can e-sign; my last contract was signed within two minutes,&#8221; says Brunton.</p>

<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A simpler to serve your customers</strong></span></h1>
<h2><strong>1. <a href="http://www.shipworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShipWorks</a></strong></h2>
<p>If you own an e-commerce business, efficient shipping is key to your success. Despite being a critical business process, it can be daunting to manage. &#8220;Prior to using ShipWorks, we had to manage orders from the backend of multiple sites like Amazon.com, Staples.com, etc.&#8221; says Andrew Jacobs of JAM Paper &amp; Envelope. &#8220;As though shipping from multiple sites isn’t tough enough, we also had to log into multiple sites to print orders, make shipping labels, upload tracking numbers, and mark items as shipped.&#8221; Since transitioning to ShipWorks, Jacobs says his team can manage orders in one location, connect to any website on which they sell, set up rules, and run reports.</p>
<h2><strong>2. <a href="https://www.livechatinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live Chat</a></strong></h2>
<p>Customers&#8217; expectations for service don’t diminish because your business is small. Jermaine Valentine of Web Heroes says that Live Chat (which starts at $16 a month) has reduced call and email volume and made his company more customer-friendly. &#8220;It allows you to provide online chat to customers and has a ticketing system to streamline customer support. You can set up departments and have multiple agents assigned to specific departments. Having knowledgeable staff members on hand to help with pre-sale and support questions has really supercharged our customer service,&#8221; says Valentine.</p>

But is it worth the ultimate cost and profitability you sacrifice? Here are five important questions all small business owners should consider before deciding to offer deep discounts.</p>
<p><strong>1.Will your discount attract the customers you really want? </strong>When demand lags or sales are unpredictable, it may seem like <em>any</em> paying customer is worth acquiring, regardless of what you must give up to attract them. But it’s important to know what type of customer a discount is likely to attract so you can plan your future marketing strategies appropriately.</p>
<p>Elise Walton, owner of <a href="http://www.balanced-harmony.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balanced Harmony Massage</a> learned that lesson when she offered a deep discount through a daily deal site, in an effort to gain new clients. Though her discounted offer (more than 50% off regular prices) did bring in more than 200 new customers, not one returned after they had redeemed the deal. In the surveys she distributed, most gave the same explanation. They had a great experience—but they said they were only deal shoppers. “I have not done any more deep discounts, and have a different approach to get and retain clients now,” says Walton.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Have you considered the impact to your brand? </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">As the saying goes, perception is reality. If you intend to charge a premium for your products down the road because you believe what you offer is superior, think about the impact discounts can have on your brand image. (It’s also important to consider how you’ll deal with customers who pay full price, and find out about your discount).</span></p>
<p>Dennis Michael of <a href="http://wakecreative.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wake Creative</a> realized the negative connotation discounts have on perception in his early years as a business owner. “I was getting the reputation as the &#8216;cheap guy&#8217;. The wrong type of client was gravitating to me because I discounted myself.” Eventually, Michael began charging what he felt he was worth. He says his reputation became more credible, and his own pride and accountability in his business increased, too. Because he knew that customers were willing to pay a fair rate for his service, he was more committed to delivering a superior product.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Do you have a plan for how to demonstrate value once the discount ends? </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If you determine that you are willing to offer deep discounts in exchange for short-term business gains, formulate a plan for how you’ll retain customers when the time comes to increase prices and/or eliminate the discount. “When I ran into a client looking for a discount, I would tell them no. If they griped over price, I would not budge.  Instead of discounting my price, I began adding extras into my quotes that were easy for me to bang out but gave the client added value,” says Michael .</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">4. Can you control the message (and who sees it)?</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Eric M. Ebert of </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="https://lookeen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lookeen</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> says once his software firm once offered deep discounts on their website, they learned that customers begin to perceive that as the “go to” price. Unless you find a way to fine tune who receives special offers, based on your marketing strategy. For example, his team noticed that an influential cooking blogger had remarked about their software on social media. “We reached out to her and offered to do a giveaway on her blog. We reached a whole new audience we would not have with our own website, without having to devalue our product,” says Ebert.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">5. Have you optimized price and value?</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> If you need to discount to drive business, John B. Dinsmore, Ph.D, assistant professor of marketing at Wright State University says to be strategy n how you price and communicate discounts. “People often discount their products or services in hopes of offering a price that will get people to purchase; that price point is known as “price sensitivity.” (For example, if your customer thinks a bottle of water should not cost more than $1, they probably won’t pay beyond that).</span></p>
<p>“But you can do other things to get people to pay more by bundling products,” explains Dinsmore. (Instead of trying to sell a bottle of water $1.50, for example, you can bundle it with a sandwich for $7). “Even if a sandwich and a water would usually cost $8.50, you are getting $7 instead of $1.50 from that customer and potentially, more overall profit.”</p>

Here are a few inexpensive and innovative employee perks all small business owners should consider adding to their workplace benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your workspace.</strong> A <a href="http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/startup-attract-top-employees/" target="_blank">study by Universum</a> revealed that many employees are particularly drawn to start ups and small businesses because they believe that scrappier companies offer more freedom and flexibility. Though a <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home" target="_blank">wide body of research</a> shows that allowing workers the option to work from home least some of the time is an impactful perk that can make employees more productive and happier in their jobs, you can improve employee experience when they’re in the office, too.</p>
<p>At Facebook, individuals are reportedly allowed to tailor the size, shape, and orientation of their personal workspace to preference. Teams and departments that work closely are free to determine the best way to configure their shared spaces. Whether your employees choose for stability balls in place of chairs, standing work stations instead of desks, or the removal of partitions around their desks altogether, businesses of any size can afford to give employees the freedom they crave.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly “recess.”</strong> School age children are given recess as a means to give their bodies an opportunity to move, and their brains a break from the highly structured school day. Adulthood doesn’t erase the efficacy of breaks when it comes to giving employees the release they need to be mentally focused, creative, and engaged.</p>
<p>Consider the outcome of 3M’s “15 percent program,” which gives every employee the chance to work on whatever they want, for 15 percent of the week. Employees use the time work on job-related tasks, to explore ideas relevant to the company in some other way, and sometimes, to do little work-related thinking. Though that may seem like poor time management for a resource-strapped small business, consider the results: 3M’s innovation program famously led to the invention of the Post It Note. Similar programs are now offered at Hewlett Packard and Google because to stimulate innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Empower employees to use time off how and when they want. </strong>Work-life balance is often touted by recruiters part of the culture—but falls short in practice under the realities of the pressure to perform. (And what small business isn’t under immense pressure?) But giving employees the freedom to determine when they need time off can prove critical to how engaged and invested they are in their jobs.</p>
<p>At Netflix and Hubspot, the sky’s the limit when it comes to vacation. Moz even pays employees a bonus to help subsidize their travel costs for vacation. You may not be able to offer those kind of perks—but it costs nothing to offer your employees a flexible vacation time or paid time off that allows them to choose when they need a break, without having to call in sick or invent a family emergency in order to take the time away that they need. Experts <a href="https://kinhr.com/the-myth-of-untracked-unlimited-time-off/" target="_blank">Kin HR</a> explain that flexible vacation benefits ultimately reduce absenteeism, and ease the stress on co-workers when employees do take time off.</p>
<p><strong>Make work feel like fun.</strong> Annual team-building events, office softball leagues and Friday happy hours can establish a sense of camaraderie&#8211;but all require that the employee spend even more time at work (or at least, with work buddies) than may be preferred.</p>
<p>Real perks don’t require additional effort on the part of the employee—but they make work feel less like a job. For that reason, workplace game rooms can be the perfect solution. Whether you add an air hockey, table dart board or Wii gaming system, adding a game room to your environment can help employees unwind, build relationships—and provide a far more fun venue for meetings than sitting in a conference room.</p>
