										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="576" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1283145100-768x576.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1283145100-768x576.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_1283145100.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">February 2019 has been a rewarding month for small business owners as they received record-high loan approvals from big banks. The percentage of loan approvals by these banks reached a satisfying 27.2% in the last month. However, the approval rate went down at small banks, other lenders and credit unions that offer traditional banking services. These results were shared by Rohit Arora, CEO of Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Biz2Credit was founded in 2007 and has a virtual platform that connects business lenders and borrowers. It is rapidly increasing its digital network that offers state-of-the-art technology and solutions for banks, investors and other financial setups. It was amongst the top 200 fast developing tech companies of 2018.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Arora, the rate of investment is on the lower side but the recent economic performance of many companies has put them in a favorable position to receive loans. A leading expert ofhis field, Arora, is currently seeing a stable future for small businesses as the central banking system of America, the Federal Reserve System, is slowing down the upward trend of interest for borrowers. He shared the good news that money is readily available for small business ventures.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This positivity was shared by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell who was of the view that the American economy seemed well-placed and its future appeared quite promising. He cited subdued inflation and appropriate policy rate as encouraging indicators.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as Powell saw interest rates increase four times during his tenure he seemed cautious. He was of the opinion that as the global economy appears to be slowing down, a lot has to be observed and evolving trends have to be monitored closely before making any changes in policies regarding interest rates.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Powell predicted a steady and secure growth rate but said that it might be slower than 2018 when the growth rate was the highest since the economic crisis.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, small banks did not share the confidence of bigger banks; their approval of loan applications for small ventures dropped to 48.6% in February from 49.8% in January. The rate of loan approval by alternative lenders also saw a slight downward trend from 57.3% to 57.2% in February. This was echoed by a slight dip in loan approvals by credit unions that went down to 40.2% in February from 40.3% in January. The JobsReport published on March 8 reported an alarming decrease in the number of new jobs created as only 20,000 new jobs were offered. In addition, a marked downward trend was noticed in January in the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index.  </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, currently the optimism is above average and Arora of Biz2Credit believes that the economy is stable despite the government shutdown that lasted for 35 days. The loan approval rate of institutional lenders saw an increase in February as compared to the previous month and even though 2019 may not be as good a year as 2018, it seems well for small business owners.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="505" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_18660919-768x505.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_18660919-768x505.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_18660919.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rockford Local Development Corp.’s for-profit arm, which is responsible for uplifting economic development and restoring distraught properties, is all set to get an investment from Winnebago County and area banks. Both the County and the banks will partner with the city of Rockford to extend their monetary support.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration is named as the Northern Illinois Community Development Corp. and manages a loan pool worth $1 million for small businesses. This partnership has a lot to offer because, according to the officials, the current demand for monetary loans exceeds the available resources.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The six area banks and RLDC own the Northern Illinois Community Development Corp. The corporation has now approached six new banks and invited them to purchase ownership shares, which will help expand and recapitalize the existing loan pool.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new investment that promises to be worth $3.5 million, more low-interest loans will be available for Winnebago County’s small businesses. It has also been reported that out of these funds, at least $1 million will be earmarked for small businesses which are resurrecting abandoned and damaged properties and turning them into proper housing with owner occupation.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is believed the new investments will give the corporation $4.5 million, which will be available for investment in Winnebago County and Rockford’s small businesses. This will include a major chunk of $200,000 each from the County and Rockford.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom McNamara, the Mayor of Rockford, said that the city’s economy is driven by small businesses. He also said that Rockford will take its investment share out of its Redevelopment Fund. The fund gets its capital from the tax of 1% on tavern tabs and restaurant and hotel bills. The fund’s primary purpose is not just to finance downtown’s redevelopment but also cover the deficits of BMO Harris Bank Centre.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mayor further applauded the key role played by Frank Haney, the Chairman of Winnebago County’s Board and the board member Fred Wescott to put the loan expansion program into motion.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mayor continued to say that the businesses could use the loans to buy important equipment, purchase new technology and invest in introducing new product lines.  This could help small businesses hire new employees and expand. Haney also said that he is trying to convince the board members to sanction a $100,000 annual investment for two years.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He further said that a partnership among 12 banks is a very exciting prospect and the collaboration shows the kind of possibilities that can arise when the community comes together. According to Haney, it would require more than one agency to make a difference and achieve bigger development targets.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">John Phelps, the Executive Director RLDC, said that the partner banks are not looking to profit from this collaboration and their only motivation is to do good for the community. The banks could only profit from this if the corporation decided to pay dividends and so far it has not done so. He further said that the main purpose of the investment is to increase economic growth. He gave the example of the low-interest businesses loan that RLDC gave to 16 small businesses in downtown Rockford.</span></p>
