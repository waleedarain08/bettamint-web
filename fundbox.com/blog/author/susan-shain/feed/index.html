<p>An organization says it “supports diversity”—but has a homogeneous staff.</p>
<p>A company claims it “advances women”—but pays its female leaders less.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen it before: businesses that pay lip service to the ideas of diversity and inclusion, without really making a difference. Call it “pink-washing” or “rainbow-washing,” call it whatever you like. The point is, it’s not good enough.</p>
<p>So how can you truly celebrate diversity? And why does it matter? We talked to four business leaders about the value of diversity—and also got their tips for creating a vibrant and inclusive workplace.</p>
<h2>Why does diversity matter?</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this article, you probably already know diversity’s important. But if you need the numbers behind the impact, consider McKinsey’s report on <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">why diversity matters</a>.</p>
<p>Among its most salient points were these two figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>When compared to national industry medians, companies with the most racial and ethnic diversity were 35% more likely to have higher returns—and companies with the most gender diversity were 15% more likely.</li>
<li>For every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity among senior executives, company earnings rise 0.8%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although correlation doesn’t equal causation, the evidence does suggest that companies who commit to diverse leadership are more successful.</p>
<p>“More diverse companies, we believe, are better able to win top talent and improve their customer orientation, employee satisfaction, and decision making, and all that leads to a virtuous cycle of increasing returns,” states McKinsey.</p>
<p>In agreement is Stefan Kollenberg, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Crescendo, which offers a <a href="https://getcrescendo.co/workplace-inclusion-blog/2018/10/9/shared-diversity-inclusion-strategies-resources">diversity and inclusion training</a> tool. He cited the McKinsey report and also offered additional insight in a recent conversation.</p>
<p>“What really allows diverse workforces to thrive is when they feel like they’re accepted and appreciated at work,” he explains. “This feeling empowers employees to share their different — and potentially conflicting — opinions, leading to better group problem solving, more innovative products and larger profits.”</p>
<p>Anuja Ketan is co-founder and chief technology officer of <a href="https://www.newtonx.com/">NewtonX</a>. Her company, an AI-powered expert knowledge platform, has embraced diversity since its launch. She says pandering to diversity doesn’t work, and highlights <a href="http://time.com/4814714/uber-diversity-sexism-kalanick-report/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem">Tesla</a> as cautionary tales.</p>
<p>“If you go through the motions of hiring without emphasizing diversity, you will end up reproducing the bias of your industry,” she says. And once your company grows, she notes that could “severely impact your public perception” — which, in turn, will affect your bottom line.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/c62b07c7-2fc9-45e0-9511-9877a84c4de8_Stefan20Kollenberg20on20diversity.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Start with your team</h2>
<p>When it comes to diversity and inclusion, it all starts with your team. They are, after all, the foundation for everything you do.</p>
<p>When Ketan founded NewtonX, she and her co-founders prioritized culture and tolerance. “My co-founders and I had seen so many tech companies become toxic because of an early hire who is inappropriate or biased in the workplace,” she says. “We proactively recruited our first 10 hires and emphasized cultural awareness and respect as a crucial component of culture fit.”</p>
<p>While NewtonX never had specific quotas to fill, she says focusing on those core values allowed it to “naturally develop into a highly diverse, female-led company.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Crescendo places a heavy emphasis on the wording and placement of its job listings. “We ensure <a href="https://www.getcrescendo.co/">our job postings</a> use inclusive language and focus on the skill requirements of the role, rather than on specific degrees or years of experience which are often unnecessary barriers for applying,” says Kollenberg.</p>
<p>The company also shares its opportunities with a wide range of communities. “We want to avoid the bias of only hiring from our immediate network,” explains Kollenberg. “And focus on meeting people where they are.”</p>
<p>Andres Zapata, co-founder of integrated marketing agency <a href="https://idfive.com/">idfive</a>, has a more laid-back approach: <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-ways-to-hire-the-right-people/">Hire the best people</a>. Period.</p>
<p>“When you are open to it all, amazing things happen, especially because nothing is forced,&#8221; says Zapata. &#8220;It’s just natural. We have women in leadership, several non-native leaders, including our top brass, and a wide range of cultural, ethnic and racial diversity amongst our ranks. And they are all seriously talented.”</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/24f9d2f3-5406-4c4e-ae2a-63e5cfc1e80a_Andres20Zapata20on20diversity.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Cultivate diverse leaders</h2>
<p>If you want to have diverse leadership, Ketan says you must be conscious of who you’re hiring for each position. She notes that, while many companies say they are “50% women,” their management is not.</p>
<p>To combat this, NewtonX strived to hire women for leadership-track roles from the beginning, and then created a “transparent promotion path to manager.”</p>
<p>Today, women hold more than half of NewtonX’s <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/hiring-your-leadership-team/">leadership positions</a>.</p>
<p>“Be proactive and intentional about hiring women and minorities for leadership and tech-focused positions,” says Ketan. “Culture comes from the top down and it’s important to live the values you espouse.”</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/f8b277e0-92b2-4e34-ae3b-f757c75af277_Anuja20Ketan20on20diversity.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Involve everyone in the process</h2>
<p>Employees are your most valuable asset. That’s why Kollenberg says understanding what they want, and maintaining open lines of communication, is absolutely vital.</p>
<p>“Feedback is incredibly important,” he says. “When getting started, mistakes will be made and you need to be willing to learn from your employees.”</p>
<p>Melisa Yatman, Senior Human Resources Business Partner for <a href="https://fundbox.com/careers/">Fundbox</a>, agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at Fundbox,” says Yatman, “we really value employee feedback. We’re currently working on rolling out a Diversity and Inclusion Program at the company. We listen to and care about the people we work with, and employees clearly value inclusion so we’ve made this a top priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get a pulse on your team’s needs, here’s what Kollenberg recommends: “Start asking questions about diversity and inclusion in your one-on-ones, have open forum discussions and create avenues for getting feedback. From there, you&#8217;ll identify which areas of your business need the most work and you can find <a href="https://www.getcrescendo.co/">solutions to those problems</a>.”</p>
<p>While you may not yet have an official Diversity and Inclusion program yet, there are many ways to get buy-in and feedback from your team. Here are some unique initiatives that Zapata’s firm idfive has introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold cookoffs where team members share “dishes inspired by their ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds.”</li>
<li>Allow employees to suggest where to volunteer for the company’s annual “Day of Giving.” (This year, it was the International Refugee Committee — a pitch from an employee who’s an Iraqi political refugee.)</li>
<li>Donate all the profits from the company vending machine to a charity chosen by the team.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/760c1a33-cc08-46d9-8421-cc900622f9c4_Melisa20Yatman20on20diversity.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>It’s OK to start small</h2>
<p>To create a culture of diversity, your efforts don’t have to be over-the-top or expensive. You just have to view business decisions through an inclusive lens.</p>
<p>idfive, for example, offers floating holidays so team members can take paid leave on days that are important to their own religion and culture.</p>
<p>At Crescendo, all employees list their pronouns in bios on Twitter, LinkedIn, email, etc., as part of the company’s effort to normalize the behavior.</p>
<p>And NewtonX has a “zero tolerance” policy for racist or sexist comments—even ones meant as jokes. “We believe making sure employees feel comfortable, respected and valued at the workplace is a crucial component of encouraging top-notch performance,” says Ketan. The company also outlines every meeting’s agenda beforehand, which allows “content to prevail over personalities.”</p>
<h2>Be intentional</h2>
<p>Are you seeing a common thread here? To integrate diversity into the fabric of your workplace, you don’t need a magic wand or specialized knowledge. To be successful, you do need to be open, intentional, and proactive with your efforts.</p>
<p>“To go beyond tokenism, your company&#8217;s leadership needs to do two main things: take diversity and inclusion seriously and actively ask for feedback,” says Kollenberg. “When employees see leadership committing time and effort to improve their own behavior and making the processes within the company more inclusive, it sets a strong foundation for everything else.”</p>
<p>Yatman points out that being intentional about diversity can help set the company up for business success later on.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not very common for an early-stage company like Fundbox to focus on diversity initiatives, but we believe the right time to address them is early on,” says Yatman. “We want to be ahead of the curve and align our culture and business with our core values while maintaining a diverse and inclusive environment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_516106741-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Female business owner outside on her way to a meeting" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_516106741-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_516106741.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>In every successful entrepreneur’s life there comes a breaking point: When you either must clone yourself, bury yourself under the covers until all your clients disappear… or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scale your business</span>.</p>
<p>The first two aren’t great solutions, but the third is tried and true. If you want to grow, you must scale. That means you must create replicable processes, expand your team, and implement strategies that will increase your revenue.</p>
<p>But how do you accomplish that in a sustainable way? In a way that allows your business to, say, double in size—without also doubling your workload? And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will you need financing</span>?</p>
<p>We asked seven successful entrepreneurs how they scaled their businesses. Here’s what they said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9765" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9765" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Danielle-Balog_web.jpg" alt="Danielle Balog, small business owner" width="400" height="479" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9765" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Danielle Balog, founder of Laundry Care</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>1. Reinvest your profits</h2>
<p>When Danielle Balog left her job in human resources, she had two kids under 2, and she wanted to create a more flexible life. But without any specialized skills, she wasn’t sure what type of business to start. Eventually she chose something “everyone can do, but most hate”: laundry.</p>
<p>As her wash-and-fold laundry service grew, she hired more and more stay-at-home moms, and even expanded into other cities. Today, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.laundrycare.biz/">Laundry Care</a></span> has 15 staff members and 200 providers across 22 states.</p>
<p>Part of her ability to scale was due to careful spending. “During the first few years, I ran things on a shoestring budget,” she says. “I reinvested almost all of my profit so that any larger, one time purchases were either paid with liquid assets or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/">0% APR credit card</a></span>.”</p>
<p>Later, to expand her infrastructure and footprint, Balog took out a $50,000 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-women/">business loan</a></span> and $30,000 <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work/">line of credit</a></span>. She says those funds paid “for larger projects such as a new, custom CRM, website and soon-to-be-released mobile app.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_9767" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9767" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9767 size-full" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ishveen-forbes_web.jpg" alt="Ishveen Anand, small business owner" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ishveen-forbes_web.jpg 600w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ishveen-forbes_web-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9767" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Ishveen Anand, founder of OpenSponsorship</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Know your stuff</h2>
<p>As a former sports agent and management consultant, Ishveen Anand knew there was a better way to complete sponsorship deals.</p>
<p>Using her unique background, she founded <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.opensponsorship.com/">OpenSponsorship</a></span>, the largest platform connecting sponsors with professional athletes. In three years, more than 3,500 athletes and 2,500 brands have signed up, executing more than 2,000 deals.</p>
<p>Whether working with potential clients, employees or investors, Anand says one key has been a deep understanding of her business and competitors.</p>
<p>“Know your own business and industry landscape inside and out,” she says. “Whether it’s during sales meetings, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-world-recruiting-fundbox-cash-flow/">recruiting</a>,</span> or raising money, you need to show that <span style="font-style: italic;">you </span>are the one to bring the solution alive.”</p>
<p>“As a female, this is five times more important,” she continues. “We’re not given the benefit of the doubt, so we need to work even harder to show that we’re the one [to choose].”</p>
<figure id="attachment_9770" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9770" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9770" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lora-Ivanova_web.jpg" alt="Lora Ivanova, small business owner" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lora-Ivanova_web.jpg 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Lora-Ivanova_web-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9770" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Lora Ivanova, founder of myLAB Box</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Hire the right people</h2>
<p>Lora Ivanova thought outside—and inside—the box when she founded <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.mylabbox.com/">myLAB Box</a></span>, an innovative at-home STD screening service. Since its launch in 2014, it’s helped more than 20,000 customers and earned more than $2.5 million, according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AngelList</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout that journey, what’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-best-advice-for-new-business-owners/">the most important thing Ivanova has learned</a></span>?</p>
<p>“To hire and empower people who are better than I am,” she says. “Early-stage startups can be a big challenge because the teams are small, so founders often wear multiple hats.”</p>
<p>Although Ivanova acknowledges CEOs are usually good at many things—that’s probably why they’re CEOs—but they must look beyond themselves if they want to scale. “What really helps you grow a business is when you begin bringing people to help,” she adds.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9779" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9779" style="width: 523px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9779 size-full" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Octavia-Conner-HS2.jpg" alt="Octavia Conner, small business owner" width="523" height="429" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9779" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Octavia Conner, founder of Say Yes To Profits</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>4. Document everything</h2>
<p>If you want to eventually hire those essential team members, Octavia Conner says you should start preparing now.</p>
<p>“From the start of the day until the end of the day, from onboarding new clients to social media posting, I documented everything I did,” Conner says. “This allowed me to easily hand off work to my staff.”</p>
<p>Though the team at her <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-accounting-business/">accounting</a></span> and virtual CFO business, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://sayyestoprofits.com/">Say Yes To Profits</a></span>, is still small,  her revenue has grown exponentially. In 2015, she earned $22,000, a profit margin of <span style="font-style: italic;">negative </span>15 percent; in 2017, she earned $135,500, a profit margin of 35 percent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9766" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9766" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9766" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ElisaDoucette_web.jpg" alt="Elisa Doucette, smal business owner" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ElisaDoucette_web.jpg 600w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ElisaDoucette_web-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9766" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Elisa Doucette, founder of Craft Your Content</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>5. Create a clear vision</h2>
<p>Elisa Doucette was freelancing as a managing editor when her workload became overwhelming. For help, she hired an executive assistant and another editor. Then, when the work continued to roll in, she decided to launch <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.craftyourcontent.com/">Craft Your Content</a></span>, a content editing, proofreading and management agency. Three years into her business, she now has a team of eight.</p>
<p>In addition to documenting processes, Doucette also thinks it’s important to outline your company’s mission, voice, vision, values and culture.</p>
<p>“I didn&#8217;t want a team of remote workers who were simply checking boxes on a list and waiting for someone to tell them what to do,” she says. “I wanted to create a solid foundation for them to understand what the agency stands for, so they could feel empowered to make any important decisions about how to complete their tasks.”</p>
<p>Putting the ball in her team’s court has worked well. When “terror struck” after her managing editor left, one of her other team members jumped in and asked to take over the role.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been really lucky to have a culture and environment where <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-scale-grow-freelance-business/">my team wants to grow</a></span> and develop their roles within the agency,” she notes.</p>

<h2>6. Know when to step aside</h2>
<p>As military spouses who were constantly moving around, Lisa Bradley and Cameron Cruse found it difficult to create careers.</p>
<p>So, one winter, they each invested $2,100 in materials and began making handbags in an attic. Soon, they hired other spouses to make bags in their own homes. Two years later, they landed on Shark Tank and received $100,000 in exchange for a 20 percent stake in their company.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2016, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.rriveter.com/">R.Riveter</a></span> grew 1,475 percent, landing it on Inc.&#8217;s 2017 list of fastest-growing private companies in America. More importantly, it provided income to 103 military families, with one third of every dollar spent going to a military families.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all that success, Bradley recently stepped down as CEO, and hired an experienced executive to take her place.</p>
<p>“Successful founders know how to hire the right people in correct roles as the business grows,” she says. “This critical leadership function applies to the founders as well.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen other founders get in the way of good execution,” she continues. “Cameron and I want to focus on growing our vision of the company—and leverage our CEO to help us execute [it].”</p>
<figure id="attachment_9772" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9772" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9772" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Red-Duck-founders_web.jpg" alt="Karen Bonner, Jess Hilbert, and Shannon Oliver, co-founders of Red Duck Foods" width="600" height="432" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Red-Duck-founders_web.jpg 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Red-Duck-founders_web-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9772" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Karen Bonner, Jess Hilbert, and Shannon Oliver, co-founders of Red Duck Foods</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>7. Consider the big picture</h2>
<p>Soon after Karen Bonner and co-founders Jess Hilbert and Shannon Oliver made ketchup for a grad school assignment, they decided to turn it into a business, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.redduckfoods.com/">Red Duck Foods</a></span> was born.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the organic condiment company’s sales have grown by 316 percent. It has a team of five, and will soon be in more than 3,100 stores, including Whole Foods. The company has used angel investments and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-make-the-most-of-working-capital-financing/">working capital line of credit</a></span> to finance its growth.</p>
<p>To get to this point, Bonner says stepping back has been vital. “Make time, at least on a quarterly basis, to set goals and review your progress,” she says. “Many of the most important shifts in company strategy happen when you step back from the grind and consider the big picture.”</p>
<p>Bonner also recommends creating a mastermind with other entrepreneurs. “Having a trusted group to talk through your biggest challenges is extremely helpful,” she explains.</p>
<p>Most entrepreneurs will find that scaling an organization—whether it’s a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-scale-grow-freelance-business/">freelance business</a></span> or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-surefire-ways-grow-your-cleaning-business/">cleaning company</a></span>—is a welcome challenge. After all, it’s a sign of success: that your business has expanded beyond its current capacity. Follow the advice above, and hopefully your business will soon grow to even bigger heights.</p>

<p>An average of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">849 per day</span>, in fact, with 114% more women-owned businesses in the U.S. existing today than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Though that’s exciting, the dark side is that women face significant financial challenges &#8212; especially when it comes to financing their businesses. On average, women entrepreneurs get <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/07/lending-gap-for-women-business-owners-continues-to-widen.html">50% less funding</a></span> than men, and account for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/03/13/female-founders-venture-capital/">less than 5%</a></span> of all venture capital deals.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://womenshistorymonth.gov/">Women’s History Month</a> as a reminder to keep progressing, we decided to get some advice on these financial challenges from female entrepreneurs in a variety of industries.</p>
<p>We asked them what they wish they’d known when starting their businesses. Here are the seven smart financial insights they shared.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8992" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Leslie-Fletcher-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="1" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Leslie-Fletcher-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Leslie-Fletcher-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>You won’t make money right away</h2>
<p>Think you’ll launch your website, print some business cards &#8212; and immediately start bringing in the cash? Think again.</p>
<p>“I wish I would’ve known I’d have to invest a lot of work and time into my business before I started making any money,” says Leslie Fischer, founder of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://sustainableslumber.com/">Sustainable Slumber</a></span>, a site that helps consumers find eco-friendly mattresses.</p>
<p>Fischer, for example, worked on her website every day for six months before earning her first commission.</p>
<p>“Creating an online brand requires so many different skills: SEO, writing, social media know-how, etc.,” she says. “They all take time to hone and perfect and are necessary before you see any real money.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8988" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Keisha-Rivers-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Keisha-Rivers-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Keisha-Rivers-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Businesses require startup capital</h2>
<p>And you won’t just need money to cover your personal expenses &#8212; you may need it to fund the business side of things, too. When Keisha Rivers launched <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.karsgroup.com/">The Kars Group Ltd.</a></span>, a facilitated outcome consulting firm, she neglected that aspect.</p>
<p>“I mistakenly thought I wouldn&#8217;t need any capital because my expertise was the ‘product,’” she says. “I didn&#8217;t consider website expenses, advertising, professional memberships and a host of other expenses.”</p>
<p>Rivers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-credit-cards-mistakes/">used credit cards to finance her business</a></span>, and said her financial worries made for a “very stressful” and “difficult” experience. She recommends other entrepreneurs secure enough capital to cover their expenses for six months to a year.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8986" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ann-Butler-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="1" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ann-Butler-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Ann-Butler-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Records matter</h2>
<p>Ann Butler founded <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://edibleedu.com/">Edible Education</a></span>, a program that provides hands-on cooking lessons to children. Her wish is simple: that she’d kept better records.</p>
<p>As a nonprofit, Edible Education has access to grant funding, but to receive it, she would’ve had to track how its programs affect kids: whether they eat more fruits and vegetables after completion, for example.</p>
<p>Whatever type of business you run, you should keep careful records, if not for grants, then for banks. “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/understanding-business-funding-options/">You’ll need funding to go bigger</a></span>,” says Butler. “And a keen understanding of all your measurables is imperative.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8991" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kirsten-Curry-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kirsten-Curry-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kirsten-Curry-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Securing funding is challenging</h2>
<p>When it comes to that funding, Kirsten Curry says you might need more than you think.</p>
<p>The founder of a full-service retirement plan provider called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.leadingretirement.com/">Leading Retirement Solutions</a></span>, she wishes she would’ve known “that starting a new enterprise would take twice the amount of funding than originally anticipated.”</p>
<p>That’s what Curry and her partners experienced, having underestimated how long it’d take to gain brand recognition and attract new clients.</p>
<p>And, citing statistics like those we mentioned above, Curry believes “women-owned businesses face far greater barriers in obtaining business financing.” Though she self-funded to start, she attempted to go the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bank route</span> last year, and called the experience “an entertaining fiasco.”</p>
<p>Using a government tool called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/lendermatch">Lender Match</a></span>, Curry applied to nine lending institutions. Even though her business’ revenue has increased 20% each year, the lenders said it wasn’t profitable enough to qualify for a loan. “We finally threw up our hands and put the financing on the backburner,” she says.</p>
<p>Her experience is far from unique. Curry says, “Women account for only 16% of conventional small business loans and these loans account for only 4.4% of the total dollar value of loans according to a U.S. Women’s Chamber of Commerce Policy Brief, February 2017.”</p>
<p>Things are changing, but it’s slow going, so it’s best to be prepared and aware from the get-go that finding financing can be a challenge.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8989" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kim-Kohatsu-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="1" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kim-Kohatsu-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kim-Kohatsu-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Accountants can save you money</h2>
<p>We know, we know; bookkeeping isn’t sexy. But it’s vital to running a financially-successful business. That’s especially true when it comes to your taxes.</p>
<p>“It wasn&#8217;t until I had been in business for several tax cycles that I wasn&#8217;t shocked when the bill came around,” admits Kim Kohatsu, founder of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://charlesavemktg.com/">Charles Ave Marketing</a></span>, an agency that provides copywriting, social media and paid search services.</p>
<p>Kohatsu recommends <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountant-vs-bookkeeper/">finding a trustworthy accountant</a></span> who can walk you through everything from business expenses to estimated taxes and retirement accounts.</p>
<p>“Naturally, you want your bottom line to be profitable, but the more profit you make, the more you pay in taxes,” she says. “It&#8217;s important, therefore, to understand how to maximize what you can claim as expenses.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8990" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kine-Corder-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kine-Corder-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kine-Corder-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Hiring can help you grow</h2>
<p>“I was a one-woman show for too long,” says <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://kinecorder.com">Kiné Corder</a></span>, a psychotherapist who specializes in financial therapy. “Aside from a web designer and a few apps, I was doing all the work.”</p>
<p>Corder wishes she would’ve hired a marketing person, CPA, administrative assistant and attorney during her second and third years of business &#8212; instead of waiting until year five.</p>
<p>Now that she has those experts on her side, she’s honed her marketing message, reduced her tax burden and delegated social media management &#8212; leaving her more time to generate income.</p>
<p>“I’m glad there are so many apps that kept me afloat until I could afford to make the commitment,” she says. “But hiring gave me a team, and that’s what it means to be a business owner.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8987" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Emily-Reynolds-IwishIknew.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" border="1" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Emily-Reynolds-IwishIknew.png 800w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Emily-Reynolds-IwishIknew-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2>Value yourself first</h2>
<p>When Emily Reynolds started <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://rprfirm.com/">RPR Firm</a></span>, she was a single mother on food stamps, putting nearly all her expenses on a credit card.</p>
<p>And, desperate to feed her kids, she undercharged for her services. “I look back and see the people I attracted didn’t value me or the service I provided,” she says. “Because I didn’t value myself.”</p>
<p>Today, RPR Firm offers public relations services in four cities and has a staff of more than 12. And Reynolds wishes she’d known her value from the start.</p>
<p>“No matter how far along I was in my business, I had something to offer,” she says. “Something that was worth charging more than a ‘trade’ or ‘whatever you think.’”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers to these women entrepreneurs for sharing their wisdom and for blazing their own paths to success.</p>
