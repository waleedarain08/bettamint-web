In honor of Women’s History Month, we’re highlighting helpful lessons and tips from successful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executives, and entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Identify your purpose</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re running a business, you need to identify your “big why,” said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.christinasjahli.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Sjahli Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that offers virtual CFO services to mission-driven women entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding your clear sense of purpose enables you to focus on what matters most to you and push forward in the challenging moments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already identified your purpose, take some time to reflect. Do you want to build a product that makes people’s lives easier? Do you want to create jobs in your community? Maybe you want to offer a service that helps people achieve a specific goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you figure out what’s fueling you, not only are you less likely to suffer from imposter syndrome, Sjahli said, you’re also able to set better boundaries and goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to find your purpose:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about why you wanted to start a business. What gets you excited? Who is your business for? What are you trying to achieve? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrow your focus and define your mission.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Embrace the opportunity to grow </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned to always take on things I’d never done before. Growth and comfort do not coexist.” – Virginia (Ginni) Rometty, former CEO of IBM</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not be afraid to make decisions. Do not be afraid to make mistakes.” – Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a thriving business, you have to be willing to take risks and embrace challenges. Getting outside your comfort zone can help you gain new skills, solve problems more effectively, and achieve your goals faster. Depending on your business and background, a growth opportunity could be buying the building next door or figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitize your services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to embrace growth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say yes to challenging projects and endeavors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be willing to try new things, whether that means developing a new product or targeting a different customer demographic. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out time and resources for one or two company growth projects a year, like launching a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening a second store. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Be tenacious</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are committed to creating value and if you aren’t afraid of hard times, obstacles become utterly unimportant. A nuisance perhaps, but with no real power. The world respects creation; people will get out of your way.” – Candice Carpenter Olson, former Co-CEO of Fullbridge</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, dealing with setbacks and hardships is inevitable. In order to overcome the obstacles you encounter—including the challenges unique to women, like gender biases and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/score-report-the-financial-state-of-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay inequity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—tenacity is critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe women entrepreneurs must stay resilient and go into each room with confidence like they belong,” said Chynna Morgan, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="http://gifsoutloud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifs Out Loud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that creates experiential marketing campaigns. Picking yourself up takes practice, but it’s the only way to make progress toward your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned early that rejection is protection,” Morgan said, “and everything that I went through with my business happened for a reason.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for staying tenacious: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember your purpose and find motivation there. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think creatively about how to use the resources and tools at your disposal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set boundaries so you have the energy and confidence to continue on during tough times. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Connect with others</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with fellow entrepreneurs and professionals in your field can boost your business, leading to higher revenue and happier customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find one or two organizations that align with your purpose, join them, be an active member, and provide your own insights and values,” Sjahli said. “Over time, they can be your champions and bring in future leads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to team up with other businesses for product launches or mutually beneficial marketing campaigns. “Don’t underestimate the power of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collaborations. They can take your company to the next level,” Morgan said. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips for connecting: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join a professional group in your industry. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give back to an organization related to your mission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/collaborate-community-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to other business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Adopt a learning attitude</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.” – Padmasree Warrior, Founder, President, and CO at Fable</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t succeed in business if you’re not willing to learn. Prioritizing </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-marketing-agency-blogs-follow-inspiration-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts you ahead of the curve. It keeps you humble and adaptable, introduces you to new ideas and perspectives, and helps you stay up to date on industry trends and shifting </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a little bit of effort goes a long way. “Be one percent better every day,” said Sjahli. “Aim high and long-term, but take small steps forward every day.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips to prioritize learning: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get curious about the different aspects of running your business—from product development to customer service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep up with the news in your industry.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask to shadow your employees to learn what they do on a daily basis. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a course or seminar.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for conferences and events in your field. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Ask for help </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. Always be cultivating a support network so that when you stumble—and you will—they’ll be there to catch you.” – </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ladies-get-paid-founder-claire-wasserman-helps-women-entrepreneurs-thrive/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Wasserman</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO and Founder of Ladies Get Paid</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a business isn’t a one-person job. Even if you’re a sole proprietor, it’s still crucial to lean on other people for support and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-best-advice-for-new-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As business owners, sometimes we believe we’re supposed to have all the answers, but the truth is, asking for help is what makes you a great business owner,” Morgan said. “Knowing your strengths and bringing in people to help you with your weaknesses is vital in building a great company.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for asking for help: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask other successful business owners for advice. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smart, capable team members. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource work you don’t have the time or bandwidth to take on. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Invest in financial knowledge</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run a sustainable, profitable business, you have to invest in your own financial knowledge. Understanding your business’s financials is the first step to pricing your offerings correctly, setting realistic revenue goals, planning for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and securing funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth requires you to know your company’s financial health and to have financial visibility of the future,” Sjahli said, “which means you must understand the story behind your balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow.” </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to improve your financial knowledge: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take an active interest in your company’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, revenue, and profit margin.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set goals with financial targets in mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building powerful businesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or a successful business owner, there’s always room to learn and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million job openings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country this summer, marking the highest number ever on record. With more jobs available than people searching for them—and with </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of Americans quitting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—small businesses are struggling to find and hire new employees.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To capture the attention of job seekers in the current climate, business owners need to stand out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer the right incentives. Here are four smart ways to attract qualified candidates (beyond just posting a job ad):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Expand your online presence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business’s online presence takes upfront work and consistent effort, but it’s an effective way to draw potential employees in. These four strategies can help your business become more visible and memorable. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Post frequently on LinkedIn: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn is the platform for job hunting and referrals, so it’s a good place for employees to learn about your business. In addition to posting job ads and industry updates, you may want to spotlight employees, feature positive customer reviews, and share your business’s accomplishments or achievements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tap into social media: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-tips-planning-social-media-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the easiest ways to get in front of prospective employees. When you’re brainstorming post ideas, think of how you can get job candidates excited while staying authentic to your brand and style. If you run a bakery, for example, you could share a behind-the-scenes video of how you make your croissants. If you operate a dental office, you could make an infographic that breaks down your employee benefits and workplace perks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improve your website:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your business’s website is usually the first place job candidates visit when researching an open role, so it’s crucial to make a positive impact. Start by revamping your landing page so it’s visually intriguing, scannable, and informative. Next, update your “careers” page with more information about your business, workplace culture, and employee benefits. You may also want to update your business’s “about” section or include relevant keywords throughout your site to improve SEO.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Alert the presses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive press can pique the interest of job seekers. Consider writing a press release to announce good business news, like an expansion or new product launch. You could also reach out to local news outlets to pitch a story about your business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Share job ads with niche communities </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a job ad on a job search website is like shouting into the void; your post can get buried under thousands of other similar ads. Instead of relying solely on job search sites, make an effort to show up in the places where prospective employees spend their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by listing out the skills, qualifications, and experience level necessary for the roles you’re hiring for. From there, research activities, communities, and groups that line up with the skills and qualifications you outlined. For example, if you need hard-working summer staff for your beach cafe, you could post a flyer at a nearby high school. If you’re looking for employees with basic medical knowledge to work at your orthopedic practice, you could share your job ad in the local university newsletter or campus pre-med Facebook community.   </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Lead with your values and workplace culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees today have higher expectations for the businesses they work at. The </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">majority of employees want three things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a 2021 McKinsey report: a better work-life balance, more flexibility, and more emphasis on well-being at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To attract job candidates, it’s important to explain </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what you can offer employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beyond a paycheck. On your business website, in your job ads, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your online platforms, work on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Share your business’s values: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees want to work for companies that align with their beliefs and support causes they care about. By openly discussing your business’s values and bigger purpose—whether it’s to expand education or support your local community—you can attract job candidates who will be excited and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motivated to work for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Highlight your workplace culture: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describe your unique workplace culture on your website and in your social media posts and job ads. Maybe you give employees flexible arrival and departure times, for example. Or maybe you encourage everyone to share ideas in company meetings or take a certain amount of time off every quarter. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Revisit your compensation structure and benefits package </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter how often you post on social media or how widely you distribute your job ads—if you don’t offer competitive compensation and attractive benefits, you’ll have a difficult time filling open positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restructuring your compensation and benefits offerings may require you to drastically change your budget and company policies, but taking action now can pay dividends in the long term. Here are three tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consult your accountant: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To figure out what you can realistically offer current and potential employees, start by examining your finances. Meet with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountant-can-business-cant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ask what’s feasible. Can you bump up the base salary for certain positions, for example, or give quarterly bonuses to employees who reach specific sales targets? It’s also important to look at industry standards and check out what your competitors are currently doing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/equal-pay-employer/"><b>Ensure pay equity</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider hiring an outside expert to review your compensation plan for equity and inclusivity. An expert can assess whether there are any pay gaps, then give you practical recommendations for resolving them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reevaluate your benefits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to a 2020 study from MetLife, a comprehensive benefits package is the </span><a href="https://www.metlife.com/content/dam/metlifecom/us/ebts/pdf/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number three driver of employee well-being</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reevaluate your offerings, do some industry research or survey your employees to ask about their needs. Then consider what you can offer in addition to health insurance. The possibilities are endless. Think: extended disability leave, stipends for mental health services, reimbursements for fitness subscriptions, paid lunches, and additional vacation time.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining employees </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding qualified employees to fill the gaps in your business can be tricky—which is why it’s critical to put just as much effort toward </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as you do recruiting. Once you hire your employees, aim to do the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest time in proper onboarding and training, so employees understand their roles and responsibilities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly check in with employees to find out what they need. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give employees opportunities to grow professionally and personally. </span></li>
</ul>

If you’re not prepared for downtime, you can lose cash flow, customers, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are practical ways to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-important-steps-to-running-a-successful-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set your business up for success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here are six steps to take to prepare for your slow season: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Organize your finances</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business’s financial situation is key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping your operation alive when cash is tight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you have a clear picture of your cash flow, annual sales forecast, and expenses, you can create a more realistic budget and allocate your spending to the right expenditures. It’s a good idea to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/find-right-accountant-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet with your business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to go over the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a cash flow forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to figure out how much money you have to work with during your slow season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list of your </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;oq=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i299.3165j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and variable expenses to see what you need to save—and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-cut-expenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where you could potentially cut costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You want to ensure you have enough cash to cover your rent, business website, debt obligations, payroll, and equipment maintenance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sales or revenue forecast: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on your data from last year, estimate how much revenue you can generate during the slow period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Financing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider whether or not you need financing. You might need a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help cover ongoing operating expenses, for example, or a term loan to buy inventory in bulk before your busy season ramps up again. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Get rid of extra inventory</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inventory you carry during your business’s high season can quickly become a burden come the slow season. Depending on the products or services you offer, excess inventory either means wasted revenue potential or extra storage costs—and sometimes both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offloading extra inventory gives you the chance to earn money on slow-moving stock, make the most of products with a short lifespan, and save on storage fees and future marketing expenses. Here are a few ways to get rid of inventory ahead of a slow period:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create promotions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling items for a discount or limited time only can help you reduce inventory fast. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bundle products: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair slower-moving stock with one or two customer favorites, and sell the package for a slightly higher price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Re-market inventory:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> See if you can alter your products slightly, or market them to a different group of customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Return inventory to a supplier: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to your supplier to ask if they’ll let you exchange or return unsold inventory. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sell inventory to another business: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the type of inventory you carry, you may be able to sell extra materials, parts, or products to another business at a discounted rate. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Donate your inventory: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the value of giving away your inventory versus paying to store it. You could donate products or supplies to a nonprofit organization, a local school or shelter, or a small business that needs a boost. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Brainstorm off-season revenue streams</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can find a way to keep the cash coming in when demand is lower, you might save yourself stress during the slow season. First, consider your business model, financial goals, and bandwidth. If you have the time and resources to add another revenue stream to your business, then you can start brainstorming possibilities. Here are just a few options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Turn your service into a product: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting out a valuable product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help satisfy customers and net you a bit of extra cash. If you run a business that provides ski lessons, for example, you could create and sell an online workout guide with videos and tips to keep skiers in shape during the off-season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Experiment with a subscription model: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can bring in extra cash by giving your customers the option to sign up for a subscription. Customers could pay a monthly fee to get access to your services year-round, for example, or pay monthly in order to score discounted rates on services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Partner with other businesses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to local businesses or complementary online companies to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do cross-promotions or strategic partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sublet your business space: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t need your building, storefront, or office for a few months, try subletting it out to another business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Check in with your customers</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to maintain your business—especially before a slow period—is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-enhance-customer-experience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on customer retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After all, it’s generally easier and more affordable to keep the customers you already have than it is to find new ones. Instead of letting your customers fade into the background during your slow months, find ways to stay connected. Here are some ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Make a call: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you offer a seasonal service like yard maintenance or holiday light installation, reach out to your customers during the off-season to check in. You can ask if they need any help, or give them a discount code to use on their next service.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Keep customers in the loop: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your business’s name top of mind by sending out regular emails with promotion opportunities, industry news, or important business announcements. If you shut down your business for a certain period of time every year, make sure your customers know when you’re opening your doors again. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a loyalty program: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show customers you value their business by offering rewards and perks. You can offer discounts for referrals, or create a system where people get additional points with each purchase or service. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Make a marketing plan</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not need to allocate as much money to marketing if your business has a true off-season, but it’s still smart to have a game plan for the slower months. Consistent marketing is critical to drawing in new customers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping current ones engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To come up with an effective plan, start by laying out your budget for marketing and advertising during peak season. From there, you can work backward and see what’s realistic for the slower season. Here are just a handful of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/b2b-marketing-strategies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may want to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-businesss-instagram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-down on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to connect with customers and promote your offerings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put out content (like email newsletters, blog posts, videos, and guides) that help generate brand awareness. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a few low-cost, high-impact ad placements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend in-person events and online conferences to network and keep your business’s name out there.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Invest in business improvements </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow periods are the perfect time to invest back into your business. Even a few simple improvements can help you increase revenue, attract more customers during the busy season, and increase operational efficiency. Before you start making changes, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the next busy season and beyond. Depending on what you want to achieve, you may decide to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Streamline administrative processes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assess your internal processes and systems for efficiency and ease. To fix inconveniences or problems, you may need to organize your digital files, invest in customer relationship management software, or change payroll providers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Train your workforce: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train your employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on proper customer service and job techniques, so you can hit the ground running come busy season. You can also use this time to search for new job candidates.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your equipment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule maintenance checks for big-ticket items, like point-of-sale systems, computers, machinery, and vehicles. You may want to replace old models or research new technology and equipment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Network: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an effort to connect with business owners in your community and attend virtual or in-person industry conferences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your website: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your site a refresh: fix any bugs, update old content and information, and give your landing page a makeover. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a seasonal operation can be challenging, but with a little planning and preparation, you can thrive all year long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need working capital to get through a slow period or take advantage of a busy one, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out Fundbox’s line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Also called Latinx Heritage Month, Hispanic Heritage Month takes place from September 15th to October 15th, a time when we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrate the histories, cultures and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the businesses we shop at every day, the food on our table, the music we dance to, and the homes we live in to the doctors and nurses on the frontlines, the teachers in our schools, and those serving in our government, the list of contributions Hispanics and Latinx have made in this country is endless,” said Rachel Matos, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://www.bluelotuscollective.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Lotus Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the co-founder and CMO of </span><a href="https://www.mycajita.com/?SID=qoba4jefu2kmkkbtk1s4rp52e1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MyCajta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity for businesses to pay homage to those contributions, Matos explained, and “learn the origins of traditions and cultures that have greatly impacted our society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five ways your business can honor and celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Seek out and support Hispanic-owned businesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic Heritage Month is an especially great time to champion Hispanic and Latinx </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-entrepreneur-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Stanford University’s 2019 State of Latino Entrepreneurship report, the number of Latinx business owners has </span><a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/report-slei-state-latino-entrepreneurship-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grown 34% over the last decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to just 1% for all business owners. Collectively, Latinx-owned companies generated $470 billion in revenue in 2016, but the average revenues for individual Latinx-owned businesses are still only half those of non-Latinx-owned businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine the incredible impact if opportunities and resources for Latinx business owners were equal to those of non-Latinx business owners,” said Matos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you can help uplift Hispanic business owners and their employees in a number of ways. Here are a few ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchase office supplies and other business necessities from Hispanic-owned companies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a Hispanic-owned operation for one of your business needs, like printing </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/content-marketing-local-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> materials or maintaining equipment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compile a list of Hispanic-owned businesses in your community and encourage your employees to visit them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave positive online reviews for the businesses you buy from.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Educate your employees about Hispanic Heritage Month</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of honoring Hispanic Heritage Month is learning about the history and achievements of people of Latin descent. After all, these communities aren’t just rich in history—they are also rich in diversity, encompassing a multitude of different countries and lifestyles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating your employees can help them gain new perspectives, develop more cultural awareness and sensitivity, and reevaluate stereotypes. To help teach them, consider hosting a virtual seminar or lunch centered around Hispanic Heritage Month. You can go over:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of Hispanic Heritage Month </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latinx culture in your local community </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notable Hispanic figures in your business’s industry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important culinary, artistic, and political Hispanic influences</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Host an event that celebrates Hispanic culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fun, easy way to participate in Hispanic Heritage Month is to host an event that showcases a unique part of the varied Hispanic cultures. If you have a brick-and-mortar workplace, consider hosting a movie night featuring films made by Latinx filmmakers, or a concert celebrating Latin music and dance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another way to celebrate is to host a potluck, where everyone creates an authentic dish or purchases one from a Latinx business,” Matos suggested. If your employees work remotely, you could attend a virtual Latinx art show or concert, she added, or host a Hispanic heritage trivia game with prizes. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Donate to a Hispanic-focused nonprofit organization </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donating to an organization that centers and uplifts Hispanic and Latinx people is a powerful way to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month. You can either support a handful of different organizations, or contribute a percentage of your business’s September and October revenues to one particular cause. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To involve your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, consider matching their donations up to a certain dollar amount or holding a workplace contest. Whoever receives the best customer feedback or scores the highest monthly sales gets to choose which Hispanic-focused nonprofit they want you to donate to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a place to start, here are some organizations to check out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://hispanicheritage.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic Heritage Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supports and connects Latino leaders in the community, classroom, and workforce. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://votolatino.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voto Latino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a grassroots political organization dedicated to educating and encouraging voters. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://unitedwedream.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United We Dream</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an immigrant youth-led community that works to protect immigrant rights and end discrimination.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.healthyamericas.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Alliance for Hispanic Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a science-based, community-driven organization that provides health services to communities in need. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a good idea to look into your community’s local Hispanic-centered organizations. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Treat your employees to something special</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your employees excited about Hispanic Heritage Month by giving them a gift that celebrates Hispanic culture. Think: a gift card to a local Spanish, Mexican, Cuban, or Salvadorian restaurant, a stipend for culinary classes or music lessons, or an artisan product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matos said corporations used her subscription box service to order Day of the Dead boxes by the hundreds for their employees. “They also requested virtual demos and information packets as part of the celebration,” she said. “Not only are they educating their staff about this tradition, but they are also buying from Latinx business owners.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrate with respect </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect time to honor and support Latinx businesses and communities. As you celebrate, make sure to lead with respect, be inclusive, and have fun in the process. </span></p>

Examining your business’s numbers and measuring your performance is key to solving problems, making more informed decisions, and setting yourself up for steady </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does data matter? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you regularly gather and evaluate company data, you gain greater insight into how your business functions on both a big-picture </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular level. More information at your fingertips means you can be more strategic and proactive as a business owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewing data makes it easier to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify your business’s patterns and blind spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out your company’s strengths and weaknesses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve revenue/sales</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop more effective </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain cash flow </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set realistic goals</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 types of business data to pay attention to</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless metrics you can measure as a business owner, but most of them fall into four key areas: marketing, finances, customer experience, and sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Marketing data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without consistent, strategic marketing, your business’s growth can stall. That’s why it’s crucial to regularly review your marketing metrics to see what you’re doing right—and what you can improve upon. Here are three areas to focus on: </span></p>
<p><b>Website analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business website is full of valuable information about your marketing tactics. When you look at the analytics, pay attention to the total number of visits per month, the amount of pages visited, and the website bounce rate, which indicates how quickly visitors leave your site. It’s also smart to analyze your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-ways-boost-blog-traffic-budget-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources—like email, organic search, and social channels—so you can see which distribution channels are bringing in the most traffic. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying active on social media is a good way to brand your business and attract new customers. On each of your business accounts, make sure you record the number of followers you have, as well as the amount of likes, comments, clicks, and shares your content gets on each platform. The more engagement your content has, the better your visibility and post reach.</span></p>
<p><b>Email analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating tailored email marketing campaigns is one of the most effective ways to get in front of current and potential customers. Whether your business sends out email newsletters, promotions, or transactional messages (or all three), it’s important to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-ways-boost-email-open-conversion-rates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Knowing how often subscribers open your messages is the first step to figuring out how to tweak your emails for better engagement. You should also look at your email list growth rate and click-through rate, which show how often new people subscribe and click the links in your emails. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Financial data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your finances are the foundation of your entire operation. Getting familiar with your financial data doesn’t just give you a better idea of your company’s overall profitability, it can also make it easier to budget properly, maintain healthy cash flow, and hit your sales and revenue targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your business accountant should carve out time each month to look at your income statement, balance sheet, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s also worth tracking the following: </span></p>
<p><b>Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business expenses can reveal a lot about your company’s operational efficiency and cash flow. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which include costs like rent, employee salaries, and insurance, stay the same from month to month, while variable expenses fluctuate. Examples of variable costs include inventory, utilities, and marketing and advertising. Tallying up your fixed and variable expenses will tell you how much it costs to run your business. </span></p>
<p><b>Net profit margin: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your net profit margin shows how much of your business’s revenue translates to profit. To calculate it, start by figuring out your net income using this formula: </span><b>Net income = Sales/Revenue &#8211; Cost of goods sold &#8211; Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From there, you can calculate your net profit margin percentage: </span><b>Net profit margin = (Net income / Total sales) x 100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your net profit margin is low, you may want to consider  increasing  your revenue by selling more, raising your prices, or cutting expenses. </span></p>
<p><b>Revenue growth: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue growth is a good indicator of how steadily your business is growing. Looking at how your revenue changes from month to month or quarter to quarter can help you make more accurate sales forecasts. To calculate your revenue growth, use this formula: </span><b>Revenue growth percentage = (Current period’s revenue &#8211; Last period’s revenue) / (Last period’s revenue x 100)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Customer experience data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying competitive comes down to improving your business’s customer experience. Analyzing customer experience data is key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawing new customers in</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> satisfying the ones you already have. Here are a few metrics to consider:</span></p>
<p><b>Customer retention rates: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retention rates show you how many customers you’re maintaining, while churn rates show you how many customers you’re losing. Rather than looking at your retention and churn rates in isolation, consider what’s normal for your industry, then look at how your rates change over a period of time. If you’re consistently losing customers, you may need to examine your products, adjust your pricing, or evaluate your customer service. </span></p>
<p><b>Customer reviews:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Customer reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide valuable qualitative data about your customers’ likes and dislikes. Pay attention to your total customer reviews, your average rating, and the amount of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in the feedback you get. </span></p>
<p><b>Net promoter scores: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A net promoter score (NPS) is a simple, effective way to measure your customers’ satisfaction with your business. You can send out email surveys to figure out your company’s NPS or install a website pop-up asking customers to rank their experience on a scale of one to 10. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Sales data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to understand your sales metrics and results in order to refine your sales strategies and reach your quotas. Start by looking at the following: </span></p>
<p><b>Qualified leads: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualified leads are the people most likely to become your customers. Tracking the number of qualified leads your business has is a good way to determine whether or not you’re targeting the right markets. You can assess qualified leads by counting the number of people who visited your website, added a product to their cart, or clicked a link in one of your emails. </span></p>
<p><b>Lead to conversion rate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead to conversion rate, which shows how often </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/turn-warm-prospects-hot-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">qualified leads turn into paying customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can tell you how effective your sales strategies are. You can calculate the conversion rate using this formula: </span><b>Conversion rate = (Total number of new customers / Total number of leads) x 100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From there, you can work on improving conversion by retraining your sales team or adjusting your sales funnel. </span></p>
<p><b>Yearly sales growth rate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Looking at your annual sales growth rate gives you a better idea of how your business is progressing from year to year—and what you can do to improve. The formula is: </span><b>Yearly sales growth rate = (Current year’s sales &#8211; Last year’s sales) / (Last year’s sales x 100)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ahead with data</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluating data is a powerful way to see into your business’s future, but you need the right </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do it. Website analytics platforms, customer relationship management software, and accounting software make it easy to track tons of different business metrics. Plus, certain platforms and tools generate weekly and monthly data reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which method you choose, though, it’s important to track a variety of metrics over a significant period of time. One data point doesn’t tell much of a story, but data from a handful of different areas can paint a more complete picture of your business’s health and growth potential. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1082726258-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="businesswoman with laptop and a paper calendar covered with post-it notes" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1082726258-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1082726258.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of Q2 is approaching fast—and that means it’s time to do a mid-year check-in. The halfway point in a calendar or fiscal year is a great opportunity to reevaluate the goals you set at the start of the year, analyze your progress, and make adjustments. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of setting business goals </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly setting goals and measuring your progress is key to consistently improving your business. Not only does thoughtful goal-setting force you to plan ahead, it also gives you a way to track your work and results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the most of your goals, though, you need to revisit them often. Evaluating your goals halfway through the year is particularly valuable because it gives you time to course-correct and set yourself up for success. A mid-year check-in and reset makes it easier to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay focused and on task with your goals</span></li>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to evaluate your goals halfway through the year</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to get started? Here are four steps you can take to review and reset your business goals for Q3 and Q4. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Organize and review your goals </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by revisiting the goals you set at the end of last year and the start of Q1 and Q2. To get a clearer picture of your progress, try organizing them by category and timeline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categories could include revenue, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, marketing, operations, sales, or growth, for example. Within each category, group your goals by annual, quarterly, or monthly benchmarks. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Assess your progress</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, go through your goals and evaluate your progress according to the specific milestones you set. If you already have a system for tracking your progress, this step will be pretty straightforward. If you don’t, now is the time to implement one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each goal, work on answering the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you define progress? Which specific key performance indicators (KPIs) are you tracking? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you exceed the goal, meet it, or fall short? To what degree?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the goal is still in progress, are you on track to reach it?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What strategies have you used to reach your goals in the first half of the year? Which tactics have been helpful?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you faced any obstacles so far? If so, what are they?  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the goal is still in progress, do you think it’s realistic to reach? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any unique circumstances that have affected or will affect your ability to reach the goal?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answering these questions in detail will give you a good idea of whether or not you’re on track to meet your goals—and if you’re not, what you need to change going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let’s say you set a goal to improve your gross revenue by 10% from the same months in the previous year. If you’ve fallen short of your goal each month and there were no exceptional circumstances that disrupted your progress, you need to review the marketing and sales strategies you’ve been using. Maybe you need to rework your sales funnel, for example, or allocate your resources to a different </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distribution channel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also a possibility that the goal itself isn’t realistic given your customer base and budget, which means you may have to change it. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Adjust your goals with new information</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve measured your progress, think about which changes (if any) you need to implement for the second half of the year to either meet or exceed your goals. Here are some factors that can contribute to your successes or struggles: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seasonality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes to your team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes to your customer or client base</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow fluctuation </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unforeseen events or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-disaster-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crises</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless circumstantial changes can affect your goal progress. If your customer base has grown significantly over the past quarter, your cash flow might be tied up in inventory. If your project manager recently quit, you may not have enough resources or time to take on new clients for a while. If your busy season is coming up, you may have more revenue than usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s also important to think about your business from a holistic standpoint. Maybe you’ve hit your sales targets every month, for instance, but you know from a recent employee survey that your sales team is feeling overwhelmed and burnt out. In that case, continuing with the same benchmarks for the rest of the year could jeopardize the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">satisfaction and wellbeing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why it’s helpful to ask the following questions when adjusting your goals: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this still an important goal to strive for? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it realistic? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this goal in line with our company values? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do we have the resources and time necessary to pursue this goal?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your answers, you can either scrap the goal, amend it, or leave it as is. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Create monthly and weekly plans for carrying out your goals</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surest way to reach your goals is to create a reasonable plan for executing them. Breaking your goal down into smaller pieces makes it feel more achievable. For each goal, consider the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tasks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need to do each month, week, and day to make progress on your goal? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>People: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who will be in charge of executing each task? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Resources:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What resources do you need to achieve your goal? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Results: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does success look like for this goal? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that one of your goals is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-hiring-challenges-and-solutions-for-small-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an administrative assistant by the end of Q3. Using the format above, you might include the following information: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tasks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Write a job description for the role by the end of week one, post the job description to several different job boards and recruiting sites by the end of week two, review all the applications that come in by the end of week five, schedule interviews by the end of week seven, etc.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>People: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owner and HR admin to write the job description together, HR to post the job online, HR to screen all applications then send the top five to business owner, etc. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Resources: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subscriptions to job search engines and recruiting sites; market standard salary information; training guide for new hires, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Results: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the new administrative assistant through the onboarding process by week 12.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use a spreadsheet to list out your various task details and timelines, or try a project management tool. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting SMART goals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re running a business, it’s tempting to set lofty goals, but dreaming big only gets you so far. You’ll have more success meeting your business goals if they follow the SMART format, meaning they’re specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, instead of saying you want to acquire more customers by the end of the year, you could say you want to grow your customer base by 5% each month until you reach 5,000 customers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing the mid-point check-in</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out what works in your business takes trial and error, but the more often you set and revisit your goals, the more success you’re likely to have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, instead of moving fast without looking back, take the time to check in, honestly evaluate your efforts, and pivot if you need to. Your business could be better for it in the long run. </span></p>

A cash flow statement is a summary of your company’s incoming and outgoing cash from three main areas: 1) operations, 2) investments, and 3) financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and balance sheet, a cash flow statement can give you a better picture of your business’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including your profitability and spending habits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculate cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may seem tricky, but it’s fairly straightforward in practice. There are two ways to prepare your cash flow statement: the direct method of cash flow and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indirect method of cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct vs. indirect method of cash flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both methods of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/abcs-overcoming-cash-flow-gaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yield the same total cash flow amount, but the way the information is presented is different. The difference, however, only applies to the operating cash flow. The investing and financing sections present the same way whether you use the statement of cash flows direct method or indirect method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the </span><b>direct method of cash flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you count only the money that actually leaves or enters your business during the designated reporting period. To do that, you start with a blank slate, then add and subtract all your company’s operational cash transactions. These transactions could include receipts from product or service sales, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/simplify-small-business-payroll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">payroll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rent, supplier payments, or materials expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>indirect method of cash flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-accounting-method-business-cash-accrual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accrual accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is when you record revenue and expenses at the time a transaction occurs, rather than when you actually lose or receive the money. Using your income statement, you start with your company’s net income as a base. From there, you refer to the changes on your balance sheet to add and subtract from your net income. Keep in mind that the indirect method accounts for non-cash factors like depreciation, while the direct method doesn’t.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why use the indirect method of cash flow?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Financial Accounting Standards Board generally prefers the direct method </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement of cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both the direct and indirect methods of cash flow are in line with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the direct method can be tedious and time-consuming, which is why business owners tend to prefer the indirect method. Plus, since most businesses already use accrual accounting to record their financial information, using the indirect method to calculate cash flow from operations keeps things consistent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate operating cash flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business’s operating cash flow is the first section of a cash flow statement. Operating </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how much net cash your business generates from everyday business operations, which is why it’s a good indicator of how profitable your company is. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-planning-for-a-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive operating cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means you’re bringing in more money from your core operations than you&#8217;re spending. Negative operating cash flow, on the other hand, could be a sign that you need to readjust your pricing model, reduce your expenses, or apply for funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formula for calculating operating cash flow is:</span></p>
<p><b>Operating cash flow = net income + depreciation &#8211; change in assets and liabilities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ll explain how to put this formula into action step by step. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to create a cash flow statement using the indirect method</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use an Excel spreadsheet to prepare your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or check out the resources and templates your accounting software offers. Whichever route you choose, make sure you have your most recent income statement and balance sheet on hand to draw from. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Record your net income and adjust for non-cash expenses</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by recording your net income for the reporting period in question. Calculating net income requires subtracting your business’s expenses, operating costs, and taxes from your total revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, adjust your net income to account for non-cash expenses, like depreciation of your assets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Adjust for assets </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/understanding-balance-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adjust your net income for increases and decreases to your assets. Your assets include things like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/difference-between-factoring-and-receivables-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts receivable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inventory, property, stock, and cash. In general, increases to your assets (except for cash) decrease your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complete cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while decreases to your assets increase your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, if you buy a commercial property, you accumulate another asset, but the amount of cash you have decreases. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Adjust for liabilities </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you account for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/assets-liabilities-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adjust your net income for changes in your liabilities, like accounts payable, expenses, and debt. Keep in mind that decreases to your liabilities—say, for example, making a loan payment—can decrease your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, increases to your liabilities in the form of credit—like adding a vendor payment to accounts payable—may either increase your cash flow or keep it steady. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Include cash flow from investing and financing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To finish off your cash flow statement, you’ll need to include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your investing and financing activities. Investing activities could include buying or selling property or equipment, or issuing or buying back common stock. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-get-working-capital-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section accounts for activities like making debt repayments and selling company stock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net change in your cash flow is the sum of all three sections of your cash flow statement. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use the direct method to calculate your cash flow from operations, you’ll need to review all your cash transactions in a given period of time. Your business’s cash transactions fall into one of two groups: cash receipts (what you receive in cash) and cash payments (what you pay in cash). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash transactions can include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash received from customer sales or payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash paid to suppliers or vendors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash payments for operating expenses (like payroll, rent, utilities, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash payments for taxes </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash received from interest, tax refunds, or other activities </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding your total cash receipts and subtracting your total cash payments will give you your net cash flow from operating activities. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your cash flow statement to get ahead </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cash flow statement is a crucial component of your company’s collective financial statements. And regularly reviewing your financials can give you a better idea of what your business is doing right, and what you may need to improve upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, for example, you discover you need more cash flow to cover operational expenses, consider applying for a Fundbox </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=blog_directindirectcashflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">line of credit</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re approved, you can get funds as soon as the next business day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure where to start, here’s how to learn more about the importance of tracking your expenses—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how to do it right. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should you track your business expenses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business expenses is the first step to improving your profitability. When you know where your money is going each month, you can make more informed decisions about your spending </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> develop more effective </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps with the following areas:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monitoring your expenses helps you maintain healthy </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and create more accurate cash flow forecasts. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Money leaks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you regularly review your spending, you can more easily identify areas where you might be losing money. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be able to create stronger revenue forecasts, which can help you set more realistic sales goals.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Taxes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping a careful record of your expenses throughout the year makes it easier to maximize your tax deductions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>ROI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking your expenses—and measuring the outcomes of those costs—is a good way to determine your ROI for each cost. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Budget:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tracking your expenses is key to creating and sticking to your business’s monthly, quarterly, and annual </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budgets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which business expenses should you track? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business expenses refer to any costs related to running your business. That includes operating expenses like software and </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as expenses related to goods and production, such as materials or storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tax deduction purposes, the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS defines business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as costs that are “ordinary and necessary.” That means any business expense you want to deduct should be a normal and essential part of maintaining operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expenses you track will vary slightly depending on your industry and business model, but in general it’s a good idea to keep tabs on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilities </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office IT</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional services </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and advertising </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software hosting </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service subscriptions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee salaries and benefits </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business travel </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business vehicles and mileage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office meals </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to manage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking your business expenses doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a good system. Before you choose one, though, set yourself up for success by taking the following steps: </span></p>
<h3>Separate your business banking from your personal banking.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already separated your personal and business financial accounts, now is the time to do it. Having a designated </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and business credit card makes it easier to categorize and account for your various business costs. </span></p>
<h3>Learn how to digitize your receipts.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save time and stress come tax season, it’s smart to get into the habit of digitizing and organizing all your business receipts. As you pay for business expenses—whether it’s gas for your delivery vehicle or updated inventory management software—take a few minutes to save and file your receipts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For paper receipts, try using a receipt scanning app to upload a digital copy to the cloud. For receipts that come via email, you can either screenshot the receipt or save a PDF copy of it. From there, make sure to label your receipts and file them in easy-to-find folders on a cloud-based drive. </span></p>
<h3>Create categories for your expenses.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to categorize expenses for small business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs is crucial. When you organize your expenses into categories, it’s easier to see patterns in your spending, identify unnecessary costs, and figure out how to adjust your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by making a list of your various </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fixed and variable business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then jot down a note or two to describe each one. As you go down the list, you’ll start to see natural categories emerge. Here are just a few examples: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Office: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">electricity bills, water bills, telephone costs, office supplies, and office equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Marketing and advertising:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software subscriptions, direct mailers, website hosting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost of goods sold: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">materials, inventory storage, packaging, labor</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 ways to track your business expenses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few methods you can use to categorize and record your business expenses:</span></p>
<h3>1. Create and update a spreadsheet</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re well versed in Excel or if you don’t have a lot of business expenses, you may want to use a spreadsheet to record your spending. You can either create your own tracking sheet or use one of Excel’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> templates. You may want to include columns that specify the following: type of business expense, amount paid, vendor or company paid, date, purpose for the cost, and any relevant notes or details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that while tracking expenses via spreadsheet is an affordable, accessible option, it’s not necessarily the most secure or accurate method. It’s easy to make errors when manually inputting information; plus, if your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically update to the cloud, you risk losing vital business information if your computer crashes. </span></p>
<h3>2. Hire an accountant</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to take a more hands-off approach to expense tracking, consider hiring a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a full-time staff member or on-call consultant. You’d still have to supply your accountant with information, invoices, and copies of your receipts, but the person you hire could  take over the daily categorization and tracking, then generate monthly or quarterly reports for you to review.</span></p>
<h3>3. Invest in expense tracking or accounting software</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using accounting software, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budgeting apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tracking systems is one of the simplest ways to ensure accurate expense tracking. Most software platforms integrate with your business bank account and automatically categorize and update your expenses, so you don’t have to spend time inputting information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget planners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and accounting systems also generate a weekly, monthly, or quarterly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so you can see real-time data about your spending whenever you want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To decide which software system will work best for your business, think about your budget, expense tracking needs, and short and long-term business goals. There are countless expense tracking options out there, but here are some of the best for small businesses: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>QuickBooks: </b><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accounting/track-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an all-in-one business accounting platform that handles payroll, expense tracking, and online payments. You can connect all your bank and payment accounts to the platform, scan business receipts directly into the app, and see your expenses organized all in one place. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mint: </b><a href="https://mint.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good option for freelancers or sole proprietors who want a simple, straightforward way to track their expenses. You can set your budget within the app, create categories for your expenses, and monitor your spending on the dashboard. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>FreshBooks: </b><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/expenses-and-receipts-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects to your bank account or credit card to automatically sort and update your expenses. The platform also lets you take pictures of your receipts and mark certain expenses as billable for easier invoicing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expensify:</b> <a href="https://use.expensify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tracking app that’s especially well-suited for business travel. You can scan your receipts, track mileage, and connect to your accounting system or business credit card. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your expenses monthly </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you use an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense tracking app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or accounting software, it’s still important to review your expenses every month for errors and insights. Taking a closer look at your expenses is a great way to understand your cash flow, make more accurate sales forecasts, and stay within your budget. </span></p>

Figuring out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to increase your credit score</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might seem overwhelming, but it’s a vital investment in your business’s future financing success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help improve business owners&#8217; credit education, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about business credit, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to build credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to repair credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and why a business credit score is so important.    </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is business credit and why does it matter? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong business credit is one of the best assets you can have as a business owner. Your business credit score—which is based on your company’s history of debt, payments, and credit—is a marker of your creditworthiness. Your score essentially tells lenders, vendors, and credit card companies how reliable you are with paying bills and making debt repayments on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The better your business credit score, the more likely you are to get approved for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/use-first-business-loan-effectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have favorable terms. Think: lower interest rates, larger lines of credit, or longer repayment terms. A healthy business score can also give you more leverage when negotiating insurance premiums or discussing payment terms with suppliers and landlords.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a business credit score yet, take the following steps to start establishing business credit in your company’s name: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that separates your personal and business finances, such as an LLC or corporation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply for an </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employer identification number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIN). </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal credit vs. business credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A personal credit score is based on your personal credit history, including the amount of debt you have and how many credit cards you’ve opened. Personal credit scores are rated on a scale of 300 to 800, while business credit scores fall between 0 and 100. So, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is a good credit score</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? For personal scores, 700 or higher is considered good; for business credit, most credit bureaus consider 80 or higher to be good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lenders check personal credit scores when reviewing business loan applications, but most prefer to evaluate business credit scores instead. However, if you don’t have business credit—either because your business is new or you’re operating as a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/self-employed-ppp-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sole proprietor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—lenders will rely on your personal credit history to assess your creditworthiness.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to improve your business credit score</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t one foolproof method for improving your business credit score, but certain strategies can help. If you want to raise your business credit score, try these five tactics: </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Update your information with business credit bureaus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three main commercial credit bureaus that collect your credit information and create your business credit scores: </span><a href="https://www.dnb.com/resources/db-credit-scores-ratings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.equifax.com/business/business-credit-reports-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equifax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/small-business/small-business-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only do all three bureaus have slightly different formulas for creating business credit scores, lenders and suppliers also report credit information to different bureaus. That’s why it’s smart to update your credit file with all three bureaus instead of just one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by visiting each credit bureau’s website and reviewing their guidelines for establishing or maintaining business credit. From there, you can review your file, upload recent </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or check your business credit report for errors and inaccuracies. If you spot any issues, report them to the credit bureau immediately. Keeping your credit file clean, accurate, and up to date is key to improving your score.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Pay your bills on time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making timely payments to lenders, vendors, utility companies, and landlords is one of the easiest ways to increase your credit score.You may have to shuffle your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-tips-for-boosting-your-cash-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to beat the due dates, but getting ahead of your payments—even by one or two days—can raise your credit score. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips to ensure you make payments on time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track your accounts payable in a spreadsheet. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up automatic online payments for recurring costs, like utilities bills and monthly debt repayments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File invoices as soon as you receive them and set calendar reminders to pay your bills when they’re due. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block off one day a week to pay bills manually. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Maintain a low credit utilization ratio</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A credit utilization ratio is the amount of credit you’ve used compared to the amount of credit you have available. Credit reporting agencies typically value lower credit utilization ratios, since it means you’re not maxing out your available credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good ratio is 30%, but an excellent ratio is around 10%. Let’s say you have a $20,000 </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-line-of-credit-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To achieve a 30% credit utilization ratio, you need to use no more than $6,000 at a time before bringing your balance back to zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try these strategies to lower your credit utilization ratio:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bring your balances as close to zero as possible.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you regularly pay off your balances, your credit utilization ratio drops. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Make micropayments throughout the month. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of paying just once a month, try making multiple smaller payments throughout the month to ensure your balance doesn’t get too high. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Increase your credit limit. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call your credit card company or credit issuer to ask for a higher limit. When you increase your limit without increasing your balance, your credit utilization ratio decreases. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open a new line of credit.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you open another line of credit and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t use it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’ll have more total available credit, which will lower your ratio. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Open a new business credit card</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a second or third </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help improve your business credit score—as long as you stay on top of your spending and monthly payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick is to apply for a business credit card that reports to one of the three major commercial credit bureaus. To find out if your credit card issuer sends its information to a credit agency, scour their website FAQs or call customer service for more information. You can also see a list of major <a href="https://www.nav.com/blog/which-credit-cards-can-help-me-build-business-credit-25633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit card issuers that report to credit bureaus here</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get your new </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, come up with a strategy for how you’ll use it. One option is to designate your card for specific business expenses, like office supplies or fuel for your delivery trucks. That way, you can easily control your monthly spending and schedule regular payments to keep your balance low.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Add trade references to your credit file</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many credit bureaus use trade references to get a glimpse into your payment history with vendors and suppliers. Trade references are based on a handful of factors, like the manner of payment, the current amount you owe, and the current amount (if any) that’s past due. Positive trade references help boost your business credit score. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you work with a handful of different vendors to buy supplies or materials for your business, ask them to report your payments to a business credit bureau. As long as you abide by the terms of your trade agreement—like paying </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/welcome-new-net-terms-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within 30 or 60 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after receiving your goods—your trade references should be positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your vendors don’t want to report to a credit bureau, you can still list them as a trade reference on your credit bureau accounts. The credit bureaus you report to will then follow up to gather your payment information. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building better business credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your business is new or more established, it’s crucial to work on improving your business credit score. Adjusting your payment habits and maintaining healthy credit can increase your score over time, putting you in a better position to secure funding and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue growing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
