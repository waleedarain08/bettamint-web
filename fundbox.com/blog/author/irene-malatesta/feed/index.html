As a small business owner, you now have more financing options than ever before—thanks to a number of creative web-based businesses offering new alternatives such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Banks? They are just the beginning.</p>
<p>Here’s our updated guide to 10 business financing options you should know about as you seek funding for your small business.<br />
And for those who want to dive deeper, we’ve got you covered with links to our detailed and comprehensive guides to each type of business funding on our list.</p>
<h2>1. Bank loans and SBA Loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first type of business financing that usually comes to mind when you hear the term ‘small business loan’ is a traditional bank loan. Bank loans come in many forms (short-term, long-term) and can be used for a wide variety of purposes (working capital, expansion, equipment purchasing, commercial real estate). Sometimes these loans are secured with collateral; sometimes not. The most important things to know about small business bank loans? You are going to need to demonstrate stability (in the form of revenue, for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the best place to get a bank loan, well, that depends on your business needs—each bank has its own set of offerings and requirements. Regardless of where you go for a loan though, you are likely to encounter the option to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan. A popular subtype of bank loans, a large portion of each SBA loan is guaranteed by the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA, a government agency that provides information and resources to entrepreneurs to help them develop strong businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This SBA guarantee makes the idea of lending to small business owners more appealing to some banks, but the loans can be difficult to get because of the stringent requirements (in order to qualify for an SBA loan, you need to have a decent credit score, measurable cash flow and a solid business plan, among other qualifications). Despite that, SBA loans are attractive to many small business owners because they offer a lot of options and flexibility in terms of how the funds can be used. What’s more, the SBA also offers a variety of</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-entrepreneur-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">loan options for minority business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and those that operate in underserved markets.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Credit card financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to purchase equipment or materials for your small business, credit cards—or, in a crunch, credit card cash advances—are easily-accessible options that save you the trouble of applying for some other type of small business loan. Credit card financing, however, can be risky and you should strongly consider only using it  for short-term needs. If you go this route, consider paying off the card in time to avoid hefty finance charges and look for cards that offer cash back rewards or airline miles.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Using credit cards for business expenses? Be sure to avoid these <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-credit-cards-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 3 Common Business Credit Card Mistakes</a>.</h3>

<h2>3. Business line of credit</h2>
<p>A business line of credit gives you access to a certain amount of capital to use as needed, typically based on your business&#8217;s cash flow and credit score (a business line of credit functions more like a credit card than <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a small business loan, but they are not one in the same</a>). You don’t have to tap into the line of credit until you actually need the funds, and you won’t accrue interest on funds you aren’t accessing either. Once you borrow from it, though, you will need to start making payments on the amount you used right away. As you pay back the actual funds borrowed, your line of credit will gradually replenish (meaning you once again have access to the money).</p>

</ul>
<h2>4. Equipment financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lending companies specialize in financing the purchase of business equipment. Another option? Ask the company you’re buying the equipment about financing—many offer their own financing programs.]</span></p>

<h2>5. Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)</h2>
<p>In this type of financing you get a lump sum advanced in anticipation of future credit card sales. Daily payments are made automatically by ACH transfer, and are typically based on a percentage of that day’s credit card transactions—so on a day when you make less, you pay less.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Invoice Factoring</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factoring is a system where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party ‘factoring’ company at a discount (typically, around 80 percent of the value of the invoices). The factoring company then takes over the job of collecting payment on those outstanding invoices from customers on your behalf (they return the 80 percent to you and keep the rest as their fee). Factoring can be helpful to small businesses that operate on a net 30 to net 90 payment system because it allows the businesses to get paid immediately rather than waiting until payment is officially due. The main downside to invoice factoring? You don’t receive your full payment. However, it can help alleviate cash flow concerns in some cases. </span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Invoice Financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the small business financing solutions we offer at Fundbox. Similar to factoring, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help improve your cash flow by allowing you to borrow against  your outstanding invoices so you don’t have to wait to get paid on a product you already delivered or a service you already provided. However, unlike factoring solutions, invoice financing through Fundbox can enable you to access 100 percent of your invoice value, up to your approved credit limit. Plus, you maintain your relationship with your customer.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Purchase order financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With purchase order financing, a lender provides the funds to buy inventory or materials to a small business that doesn’t have the cash on hand to fulfill a large order. After the order ships, the lender collects payment from the customer, subtracts fees and transfers the balance of the invoice back to the business at hand. Be aware that purchase order loans don’t apply to would-be orders—you need to have actual orders on the books in order to qualify.</span></p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Peer-to-peer loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer-to-peer lending sites are online marketplaces where businesses and individuals can obtain loans from individual investors. The online marketplace manages the transaction, serving as a kind of escrow service, and takes a fee in return. This can be a good way to get a small, short-term loan if other methods haven’t worked.</span></p>
<h2><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cb904216-3670-4c9c-b75e-89e16cf2a74d_shutterstock_94343464.jpg" alt="" /></h2>
<h2>10. Crowdfunding</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variation of peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding sites allow businesses to pitch their ideas (often new inventions or products) and seek financing from interested individuals. The difference is that the money isn’t a loan, but a payment in return for something from your business, most often in the form of equity in your company to these early investors, or even something as simple as early access to your product or service. If your idea sparks the public’s interest, it’s possible (though not probable) to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars through crowdfunding. And even though it sounds like a long shot, it could be an option for some small businesses to consider because</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the crowdfunding market is expected to grow nearly $200 billion by 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside? If for some reason you are unable to deliver on your promise to your investors, they are going to be very disappointed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_251582353-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Piggy bank wearing glasses" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_251582353-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_251582353.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>When planning to start or grow a business, many owners are keen to find out how to obtain small business loans without collateral to fund their ideas. When it comes to loans, there are two major types: unsecured and secured.</p>
<p>The primary difference between secured and unsecured loans is that a secured loan requires an asset to act as security. In other words, it’s a collateral business loan that requires you to put something up in exchange for financing (e.g., commercial real estate or a company car).</p>
<p>An unsecured loan is a no-collateral loan that has no such requirement. While there are some business loans available that require no collateral, they are not as easy to find nor as readily available as a standard secured loan.</p>
<p>While we cannot advise on which is better for you, it’s helpful to understand both options if you’re seeking business funding.</p>
<h2>How do traditional secured loans work?</h2>
<p>Most people are familiar with the idea of a secured loan since they may already use lending of this type as consumers.</p>
<p>A mortgage, for example, is the best-known secured loan, with the collateral being your home. If you fail to make your mortgage payments, eventually, the lender would be able to repossess the property.</p>
<p>The whole point of setting up a secured loan is to reduce the lender’s risk. This is why so many lenders prefer to only offer this type of loan, especially to new startups that are inherently riskier.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to collateral, or collateral under another name?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a no-collateral loan, there are limited options. And, even then, many lenders still reduce their risk through other requirements that give them leverage in case of default, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal guarantee: If you take out a loan with a personal guarantee instead of a specific item of collateral, you will be making a guarantee that you, as an individual, will pay the debt should your company default on the loan.</li>
<li>A blanket UCC lien: This is another option when lenders do not ask for a particular item of collateral. A blanket UCC lien may be placed on the business. That means should it default on its payments, the lender can then pursue the company’s assets as compensation for the remaining unpaid sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>While neither of these options is something to discount from the equation completely, it is important to have a full understanding of what they entail for you and your company before signing on the dotted line.</p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9675" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg" alt="Weighing your business funding options" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How difficult is it to get a small business loan without collateral?</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to get an unsecured business loan for your startup or established small business, there are a few options to consider. These include:</p>
<h3>SBA loans</h3>
<p>An SBA loan is backed by a federal agency, the Small Business Administration. This type of loan may or may not require collateral, and even new startups may get a loan with no need for collateral via an approved SBA lender (e.g., Some 7(a) loans for less than $25,000)). There are, however, other SBA loans that will require collateral, so it’s important to check before signing.<br />
Are SBA loans hard to get?<br />
They can be. If you’re looking for a relatively affordable form of lending, SBA loans could be the answer. Remember, though, SBA loans can take more effort to apply for, take longer to process, and they typically have rigorous eligibility requirements for approval.</p>
<p>To learn more about SBA loans and how to apply, check out our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comprehensive guide to SBA loans</a></span>.</p>
<h3>Online long-term loans</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many online lenders that offer short-term and long-term loans to companies. While both are “<strong><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/term-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">term loans</a></strong>,” there are some key differences to keep in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, a long-term loan is more traditional. The lender will advance a specific sum that will be repaid monthly over a set period of time. Though generally not as affordable as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sba-loans-supporting-small-businesses-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are relatively affordable and applying is often faster and easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short-term loan, on the other hand, also involves advancing a lump sum to the borrower, but this is then repaid in weekly or daily payments for a short period of around three to 18 months. This type of loan is usually more expensive, although it has relaxed eligibility requirements. It is also very easy to apply for when compared with traditional bank loans.</span></p>
<h3>Merchant cash advances (MCAs)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although merchant cash advances appear to require collateral, they actually do not. In fact, the financing company will only be buying your future assets—nothing you own right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a business receives a merchant cash advance, the financing company is advancing a specified sum that is then paid back using a particular percentage of sales. In essence, it is purchasing a portion of the company’s future sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eligibility requirements for this type of lending are comparatively loose, but there could be a risk to cash flow. It is important to proceed with caution when choosing this option, since many MCAs involve complex contracts and a variety of fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose an MCA, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this article comparing MCAs with SBA loans and business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Business credit cards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit cards</a> are certain to be something you are already familiar with, and they are actually a surprisingly good way of financing a business—especially when supplementing a traditional loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A zero percent introductory APR card is typically the best option since this is essentially an interest-free loan that lasts for the duration of the specified introductory period. This will vary by card and could be as long as 15 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose this option, having a clear repayment plan in place is essential since you will need to pay off the balance before the introductory period ends and the regular APR kicks in.</span></p>
<h3>Private lenders and fintech firms</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, there are a lot of private lenders out there who are willing to offer loans without collateral, as long as the business owner offers a personal guarantee. This could be in the form of a cosigner, an asset or a commodity. Although, strictly speaking, this is not quite an unsecured loan, there are many more options for the commodities or assets that you can use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to financing quickly and with relatively little paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can apply for financing online without any specific collateral, and expect a credit decision in just minutes (3 minutes, actually, based on the median decision time for Fundbox customers). All Fundbox customers are subject to UCC-1 blanket liens. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/#how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about how Fundbox loans work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Weighing the options</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When taking out a loan to fund your business, consider whether you really prefer an option that requires no collateral and why. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re concerned you may default and end up having your assets seized by the lender, it may not be the right time to seek financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think you’ll be in a more secure financial position soon? Or do you really need that financing now, in order to improve your position and save your business? If you are feeling confident in the future success of your operation, you might choose to wait and apply for a no-collateral loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, sometimes you’re not worried about losing your assets at all. Instead, you might be more concerned with speed and the ease of getting funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some owners spend 30 hours or more on paperwork just to apply for a conventional term loan to fund their business, while others decide they just do not have that time to spare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re simply concerned about the hassle and lengthy paperwork that a conventional loan could require, a faster fintech financing option might be what you’re seeking.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="American soldier flag patch" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not easy for soldiers to leave the battlefield and transition back to civilian life. Many veterans struggle with finding a job where they feel satisfied. Returning to a conventional job can feel challenging: it’s one thing to follow orders to protect the freedom of the nation; it’s another to be told what to do by a manager. Instead, many veterans decide to pursue entrepreneurship to become their own bosses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans play a vital role in the economic stability of the private sector. In fact, </span><a href="https://smallbusiness.com/resources/military-owned-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of businesses in the U.S. are veteran-owned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, like other small business owners, as a veteran, you may struggle with the same challenges that come with launching and running a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="http://veteranbusinesscoalition.org/the-death-and-rebirth-of-veteran-entrepreneurship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coalition for Veteran-Owned Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly 25% of veterans want to start a business; however, a mere 6% actually go through with it. Why? Because the reality is that veterans don’t have enough access to financing and the resources to help them acquire the capital and training they need to start a business successfully. Sadly for the veterans who start their businesses with personal and family savings, it’s often not enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are loans designed specifically for veterans through the Small Business Administration (SBA). There are also other small business loan </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/facts-veterans-and-entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options for veteran entrepreneurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are ideal for start-ups, fast cash, working capital, and financing for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best loans and financing opportunities available for veterans:</span></p>
<h2>1. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA offers several small business financing options reserved for veterans. Here are two examples of veterans-only loans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance/military-reservist-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MREIDL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available to military reservists whose business’s financial goals were unmet because an essential employee was called up to active duty. The loan is a temporary source of financing to cover operating expenses until the reservist is discharged.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SBA Veterans Advantage Program:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The VA loan typically has lower rates and fees compared to traditional loans. Under the</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/Veterans_Advantage_Borrower_Fact_Sheet_FY17_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA veterans advantage program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can get up to $150,000 with no upfront fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Most members of the regular military, National Guard, reservists, and veterans are eligible to apply for a VA loan. Specifically, to qualify for a VA business loan, the business must be 51% owned and controlled by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An honorably discharged veteran</li>
<li>A service-disabled veteran</li>
<li>An active-duty military member participating in the military Transition Assistance Program</li>
<li>A reservist or member of the National Guard</li>
<li>A spouse of any of the above</li>
<li>A widowed spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or from injuries sustained as a result of their service</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Veteran-specific financial groups</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran-specific financial groups aim to make it easier for military members to obtain the funds they need to grow their businesses. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://hiversandstrivers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Hivers and Strivers</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hivers and Strivers is an angel funding firm that funds early-stage companies founded by graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, or Merchant Marine Academy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.streetshares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Streetshares Foundation</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition to short-term loans, the foundation offers monthly grants and loans for veteran-owned businesses (or ones run by their spouses), prioritizing businesses based on their social impact and the strength of their business idea. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bunkerlabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Bunker Labs</b></a><b>: </b>Bunker Labs is a nonprofit organization that provides access to a national network of veteran and milspouse entrepreneurs dedicated to helping veterans and others in their transitioning military community start their own business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Traditional banking institutions</h2>
<p>Traditional financial institutions are options for veterans who have solid credit scores. Unfortunately, over the last several years, banks have signed off on fewer and fewer business loans. In fact, banks only approved 25.3% of the small business loans that came their way in 2018.</p>
<h2>4. Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and AngelList are some of the best crowdfunding sites for small businesses. This option is ideal for veteran entrepreneurs who are building products or creating services. Crowdfunding connects entrepreneurs to donors and investors who believe in the veteran’s project or business idea.</p>
<p><em>Considering crowdfunding? Here are 5 <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pros and cons of crowdfunding your business</a>.</em></p>
<h2>5. Invoice factoring and invoice financing</h2>
<p>Does your business have a lot of unpaid invoices? With invoice factoring, you can sell them at a discount, giving your fast cash and saving you the time you’d spend tracking down your clients to pay up. With this option, you forgo a chunk of your revenues since the invoice factoring company owns your invoices and therefore, collects payments directly from your customers.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting some funds from your accounts receivable, but you would rather maintain control of your relationship with those customers, check out a similar option, called invoice financing.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about how</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differ and what they can offer.</span></i></p>
<h2>6. Business lines of credit</h2>
<p>Unlike other forms of financing, you don’t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you actually use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process for applying and getting a line of credit varies depending on which firm you work with, but the internet and AI technology have combined to dramatically speed it up in recent years. With alternative lenders like </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> that offer business lines of credit</strong>, you can secure credit limits of up to $100,000 that you can repay over 12 or 24 weeks via auto debit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Fundbox, you can apply online without any paperwork to get started, and can expect a credit decision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in as little as 3 minutes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Education and training for  veteran entrepreneurs </span></h2>
<p>There are also amazing organizations and programs that aim to educate and train veterans to become entrepreneurs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF)</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The Syracuse University provides education and training for entrepreneurial veterans. Part of the program aims to educate veterans on how to access capital and finance their business.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ovbd/resources/160511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boots to Business</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a free 2-step education and training program to service active-duty military members transitioning out of the military and their partners or spouses who want to become entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://patriotbootcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriot Boot Camp</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span>  Patriot Boot Camp is a non-profit boot camp offered to active duty service members, veterans, and their partners or spouses. During the 3-day program, they are educated and trained on the fundamentals of starting a business by mentors.</li>
</ul>

U.S. businesses will lose an average of 5 percent of their gross revenues to fraud, according to a <a href="https://www.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2018/Default.aspx">2018 report</a> by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. Since small businesses typically have fewer fraud controls in place when compared with larger businesses, SMBs are especially vulnerable and tend to suffer much more dire effects of fraud. More broadly, consumers experienced <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/identity-theft-statistics/">$905 million</a> in total fraud losses in 2017, and the prevalence of identity theft continues to grow.</p>
<p>To help shed light on this often feared and misunderstood topic, we spoke with Dean Ad, Fraud Analyst, one of the internal experts here on the Fraud team at Fundbox. In this guide, we’ll discuss the most common types of fraud and what you should know to protect yourself and your business.</p>
<h3>In this guide:</h3>

<li><a href="#what">What is fraud and what are the most common types of fraud?</a></li>
<li><a href="#terms">An introduction to common credit fraud terms</a></li>
<li><a href="#protect">How to protect yourself—and your business—from fraud</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="what"></a>What is fraud and what are the most common types of fraud?</h2>
<p>First of all, what is fraud? In its most basic sense, “fraud” can describe any deceptive activity committed or attempted for financial gain. The word can describe many types of dishonest activity. Generally, when many people hear the term “fraud” what they think of is identity theft. There are actually several different types of fraud. While many of them involve some kind of identity theft, not all of them do.</p>
<p>A few common types of fraud include first-party fraud, second-party fraud, third-party fraud, mule fraud, and synthetic fraud. We’ll talk about each of these next. Then, we’ll look at some expert advice for business owners who want to protect themselves from fraud and identity theft.</p>
<h2><a id="terms"></a>An introduction to common credit fraud terms</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>First-party fraud</strong></li>
<li><strong>Second-party fraud</strong></li>
<li><strong>Third-party fraud</strong></li>
<li><strong>Synthetic fraud</strong></li>
<li><strong>A note about “money mules”</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>First-party fraud</h3>
<p>First-party fraud is a form of credit fraud where someone uses their own personal details to apply for and obtain credit or loans with no intention of paying them back.</p>
<p>For example, a customer of a bank might apply for a personal loan, get approved, use the funds to go on a shopping spree and never make a payment. It’s called “first-party fraud” because it involves the one person or entity’s real information, as opposed to a stolen identity. The person committing the fraud is the “first party” and their intention to commit fraud is what makes them different from someone who simply got into debt and could not repay their loan on time. First-party fraud is illegal and can result in criminal charges.</p>
<h3>Second-party fraud</h3>
<p>Second-party fraud is similar to first-party fraud, but with a key difference: one person gives their information to another person (that is, a “second party”), with the intention that they will use the information to obtain credit or a loan with no intent to repay the funds.</p>
<p>In this type of credit fraud, the first and second parties are working together to commit fraud. If you gave your personal information (like a bank account and social security number) to a friend so they could apply and get approved for credit that they then spent without repaying it, this kind of fraud also called &#8220;friendly fraud.”</p>
<h3>Third-party fraud</h3>
<p>Third-party fraud is different from and more common than first-party fraud. When you read about fraud in the news, you’re almost always reading about third party fraud. Third-party fraud occurs when a person or group of people use someone else’s identity to open accounts or get credit without the knowledge of that person.</p>
<p>“In the case of third-party fraud, the fraudster stole someone’s information without them knowing about it,” explains Dean. “Where I come in is when fraudsters then try to use that information in order to apply for a Fundbox account to draw funds without planning to repay. What happens is, a fraudster used information that does not belong to them. They may have stolen that information, stolen someone else&#8217;s Social Security number or bank accounts, either using a phishing attack, through hacking or buying that information on the Dark Web. In all of these cases, an innocent person could be victimized.”</p>
<p>According to Dean, third party fraud is one of the most harmful types of fraud because it is so scalable, giving it the power to harm many people.</p>
<p>“One person—one fraudster—can obtain hundreds of different identities or data sets and then use them,” Dean explains. “Whereas with first-party fraud, you can only use your own information, so there is a limit to the funds you can get, and you aren’t trashing some innocent person’s credit by misusing their information.”</p>
<p>Third-party fraud is a significant risk for individuals and business owners. Because most of us conduct so much business online, there are many places where our sensitive personal information could be leaked or stolen without our knowledge or consent. According to <a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/blogs/latest-thinking/identity-and-fraud/what-is-first-second-and-third-party-fraud/">Experian</a>, third-party fraud is also “associated with organized criminal activities, with up to 50 percent of third party fraud seen as part of a fraud ring with frauds linked across multiple identifies.”</p>
<h3>Synthetic fraud</h3>
<p>Another term you might encounter in discussions of fraud is “synthetic fraud.” According to a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/credit-report-freezes-534030-00033/534030-00033.pdf">report</a> from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, synthetic fraud is one of the newest, fastest-growing, and hardest-to-trace types of fraud today.</p>
<p>“Basically, synthetic fraud occurs when a fraudster uses credit reports and other information to create entirely new identities,” explains Dean. “These are synthetic identities for people who don’t really exist.”</p>
<p>Fraudsters then use these artificial identities to open credit cards, apply for loans, and more. According to a <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/while-fraud-continues-to-impact-lenders-the-rate-of-growth-is-diminishing/">2018 report</a> from credit reporting agency TransUnion, “outstanding balances of suspected synthetic fraud identities increased 6.6 percent to $885.42 million in Q4 2017, up from $830.25 million in Q4 2016 for auto loans, credit cards, personal loans, and retail cards combined.”</p>
<p>While this type of fraud mostly concerns lenders, individuals and business owners should be aware of it, too. In some cases, bits of personal data from different real people may be illegally obtained in a case of identity theft, and later stitched together to form a new synthetic identity that fraudsters then use to obtain funds. In this way, it’s possible for your real name or social security number to get attached to a totally different, fraudulent identity, causing you significant grief and potential financial losses.</p>
<h3>A note about “money mules”</h3>
<p>While you’re learning more about fraud, you might encounter the term “money mule.” A “money mule” might be used as part of a second-party fraud or third-party fraud. Money mules are vehicles for moving illicit funds around to hide their true purpose or source. A fraudster may use a “mule” as a way of creating distance between themselves, the money, and its origin.</p>
<p>For example, a fraudster might use borrowed, stolen, or fake information to create a bank account under a false name that they control. That bank account might be under the name of a friend—someone complicit in the fraud—or under the name of a legitimate bank customer or business person who has no knowledge that their personal details are being used by someone else for illegal activity.</p>
<p>Even worse, according to the <a href="https://www.apnews.com/eca04a0f5f3b4f62a701c9350c2764d5">Associated Press</a>, money mules are sometimes “people who, unwittingly or not, use their own bank accounts to move money for criminals for purposes they think are legitimate or even noble.” In other words, law-abiding individuals and business owners can be tricked into participating in a money-laundering scheme, all without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve got a handle on the most common types of fraud, you might be asking what you can do to prevent it. Keep reading for information about what you can do to help protect your business from fraud.</p>
<h2><a id="protect"></a>How to protect yourself—and your business—from fraud</h2>
<p>With so many individuals and criminal groups working hard to steal personal information and commit credit fraud, business owners should stay up to date on the risks, and actively protect themselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few simple actions everyone can take to safeguard their data and reduce the chances of becoming another fraud victim.</p>
<h3>1. Use strong passwords.</h3>
<p>You’ve probably heard this before, for good reason. One of the most important things you can do to protect your personal and business data online is to use strong passwords. For extra protection, change them frequently.</p>
<p>“Definitely be aware of your passwords and change your banking password regularly,” Dean recommends. “Do not use easy, simple passwords on important things like your banking credentials.”</p>
<p>Do not give in to the temptation to use a single password for all of your important accounts, either. If that one password is stolen, hacked, or compromised in any way, you’ll be putting multiple accounts at risk instead of just one.</p>
<p>Since it’s nearly impossible for the average person to remember the dozens of strong passwords for all the apps and accounts needed to run a business (or just live a modern life), consider using a secure password management system, such as Zoho Vault, 1Password, or LastPass. There are many password managers to choose from, depending on your budget and needs.</p>
<h3>2. Be aware of phishing.</h3>
<p>Phishing attacks can come out of nowhere and irreparably harm an entire business or cause significant damage to an individual’s finances and digital life. The purpose of most phishing attacks is to steal data from the unsuspecting victim, often with the intent to use that data to commit fraud.</p>
<p>“Definitely try to keep an eye open for phishing schemes in your inbox,” Dean advises. “If you get a message and you see a website that doesn&#8217;t have the URL, that’s a red flag.”</p>
<p>There are a few patterns to look for that many phishing schemes follow, typically using email and text messages.</p>
<p>“As an example, let&#8217;s say you received an SMS, a text message with a link that looks like it came from your bank,” says Dean. “You click on it and notice that the web address is not what you usually see with that bank. Don’t log in! It could easily be a fraudster’s website, built with the intention of tricking you into handing over your login credentials. Really open your eyes for people who try to use phishing websites to steal your information.”</p>
<h3>3. Don’t click suspicious links.</h3>
<p>Closely related to phishing, always look closely before you click any suspicious links.</p>
<p>What are “suspicious links”? Any link in an email or text message that came from san email address or phone number you don’t recognize, or any link that seems to be hiding its real content.</p>
<p>“Avoid opening links that are suspicious, that you don&#8217;t recognize,” says Dean. “Don&#8217;t click a link from a strange email, and then log in to your account from that link. If you need to log in to your bank account online, go directly to the bank URL you’re used to by typing it into the search bar of your browser and logging in normally. I never, never log in through links that are being sent either by email or by SMS.”</p>
<p>Does this mean you should avoid all mailing lists and never click a link again? Of course not. However, to be safe, you might want to make it a policy to never click links relating to your financial accounts, and always log in to those directly, as Dean suggests.</p>
<h3>4. Put an alert or freeze on your credit.</h3>
<p>There are two levels of security that you can choose to add to your credit, depending on your comfort level: a security alert, and a credit freeze.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fraud-alert-affects-application-business-financing/">fraud alert</a> makes it harder for anyone to use your information to open an account or apply for a loan in your name. You might choose to do this if you’re concerned that your private information was exposed in a data breach or otherwise compromised. With an active fraud alert, any business or entity must double-check with you before issuing new credit, giving you a chance to personally review any credit activity—and giving you some valuable peace of mind.</p>
<p>To place a fraud alert on your credit, contact any of the three major credit bureaus: TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian. (There’s no need to contact all of them. <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert">According to the FTC</a>, if you place an alert with one of them, that bureau will inform the others.)</p>
<p>When you contact them, tell them you would like to place a fraud alert on your credit, and be sure to confirm your current contact information. It should be free to place the alert, and the alert will remain active for a year before you’d need to renew it. Confirmed victims of identity theft may get a free extension on their fraud alert for seven years.</p>
<p>“I would suggest for anyone who is concerned about identity theft to put a fraud alert on their credit report,” says Dean. “That way, you make sure that you know every time your credit gets pulled.”</p>
<p>A credit freeze is similar to a fraud alert but even more secure. If you opt for a credit freeze, you’ll lock your credit reports against any new activity. With a freeze in place, no one will be able to open any new credit accounts in your name—not even you—unless you lift the freeze by providing your consent and an individual personal identification number.</p>
<p>Credit freezes don’t prevent you from getting unscreened credit offers, but they do make it much harder for any identity thieves to use your name without your knowledge by blocking all access to your credit reports. In most cases, if a lender can’t review your credit report, they won’t issue new credit.</p>
<p>To place a credit freeze, you’ll need to contact each credit bureau individually and set it up, according to the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs">FTC</a>. Make sure to confirm your contact info with each one, and keep your individual password or PIN in a safe place. As long as you have your password or PIN handy, you can always call back and unfreeze your credit immediately, should you need to use it.</p>
<h3>5. Only share info with businesses you trust.</h3>
<p>When it comes to sharing your personal information, it pays to do some research. When choosing to provide personal info or connect software accounts, consider the trustworthiness of the business or vendor.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re considering applying for financing from an online lender, make sure they’re using industry best practice security protocols. You might also look to see if they have earned any well-recognized certifications and accreditations. Some business technology and financial firms will display certifications and badges from the Better Business Bureau, attesting to their track record of handling and resolving any customer disputes in good faith.</p>
<p>You may also look for certifications from Norton or MacAfee (or both). These can indicate that the site in question supports encrypted data transmission, and is free of malware and is monitored for security vulnerabilities. In other words, for any new vendor, lender, or potential online business partner, these designations can help raise the trust factor significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, one more good way to gauge the trustworthiness of a business is to check out their reviews. This might take a few extra minutes, but it’s an easy way to uncover any big red flags. For instance, when choosing between two vendors, both of whom want you to share sensitive personal or business data, you’d probably rather connect with the one that has 1,000 five-star reviews, rather than one with only 100 reviews, or one that has a more mixed review history and more negative reviews.</p>
<h2>Defend your business from fraud</h2>
<p>Fraud is a serious matter, for individuals and business owners alike. Doing business and sharing personal information online may seem scary, but today, it’s a routine part of life.</p>
<p>While it’s impossible to guarantee that credit fraud or identity theft will never happen to you, there are many things you can do to safeguard your information. With a good understanding of how fraud typically occurs, you can make smart decisions to minimize your risk. By taking basic precautions and staying up to date on the common patterns used in credit fraud and identity theft, you can greatly decrease your risk.</p>

In addition, we have secured a $150 million credit facility. We plan to use these new investments to continue to transform the B2B credit experience so businesses will have greater cash flow stability.</p>
<p>The Series C round was oversubscribed and includes a diverse range of leading institutional investors, including Allianz X, Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), HarbourVest, 9Yards Capital, Hamilton Lane, SEB Private Equity (on behalf of clients), Cathay Innovation, Synchrony, MUFG Innovation Partners Co., Ltd., Recruit Strategic Partners, GMO Internet Group, and Arbor Ventures, as well as participation from the major existing investors including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst and Spark Capital Growth.</p>
<p>“The status quo for B2B transactions is uncertain cash flow and antiquated payment systems, which stifles business growth. If you’re a business owner and don’t know when you’re getting paid next or whether you have the funds to complete a transaction, you lose valuable time and important business opportunities,” said Eyal Shinar, Founder and CEO of Fundbox. “The remedy to this uncertainty is the ability to facilitate faster approval decisions for a business line of credit, to help enable uninterrupted cash flow. This new investment round validates the market opportunity and that our team is on the right path.”</p>
<p>“Fundbox has demonstrated a track record of success in a competitive B2B fintech market,” said Nazim Cetin, CEO of Allianz X. “Our investment underscores the belief that Fundbox will continue setting itself apart in ecommerce by employing technologies that allow corporate customers to focus on growing their business. We look forward to collaborating with Fundbox and supporting its continued growth in an expanding $21 trillion market.”</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of recent coverage of the news.</p>
<h2>Bloomberg: Fintech Fundbox Raises $176 Million to Lend to Business Using AI</h2>
<blockquote><p>The San Francisco-based startup is both a lender and a payments processor for small businesses. It uses artificial intelligence to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, collecting data from other software and services used by the business, as well as their bank accounts. The platform also facilitates quick payments to the borrower’s suppliers. “We are focused on unlocking the working capital that’s tied up in unpaid invoices,&#8221; Chief Operating Officer Prashant Fuloria said. By using Fundbox, “the seller gets paid right away,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Fundbox raises $176 million Series C to build ‘Visa’ for B2B payments</h2>
<blockquote><p>The SF-headquartered startup wants to ultimately transform B2B payments by creating a Visa-like payments network that allows businesses to transact with each other without having to know counter-party risk while also getting everyone paid faster.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Reuters: U.S. business payments firm Fundbox raises $176 million</h2>
<blockquote><p>While the consumer credit and digital payment industry has mushroomed, the transactions between companies have seen little improvement, said Eyal Shinar, CEO of Fundbox.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/fundbox-fundraising/u-s-business-payments-firm-fundbox-raises-176-million-idUSL2N26E0Y8">Read more in Reuters.</a></p>
<h2>Business Insider: Payments-and-lending startup Fundbox just nabbed fresh funding, and now its CEO has his sights set on making it the &#8216;Visa of B2B&#8217;</h2>
<blockquote><p>B2B payments have been relatively slow to digitize, especially compared with transfers that happen between individuals. But that&#8217;s starting to change, and some think the space could also see other trends spill over from the broader payments industry — consultant McKinsey said in a report published on Monday that traditional B2B payments that have big scale but are also fragmented could be part of a fresh M&amp;A wave.</p></blockquote>

<p>We use technology to unlock growth for driven businesses by accelerating payments and credit. Our goal? To revolutionize the economy, so our customers can spend more of their time focused on building their businesses.</p>
<p>We’re here for driven businesses that are ready for more: ambitious people who are ready for the challenges of opportunity and growth. Our new brand communicates these goals with a fresh, confident visual language. We’re excited to share our ongoing journey.</p>
<p><video class="aligncenter size-600" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" style="max-width: 100%"><source src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-Branding-Announcmentsm@2x-2.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><img loading="lazy" width="1320" height="743" class="aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12666" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/New-Branding-Announcmentsm@2x-2.gif" alt="Fundbox New brand announcement" /></video></p>
<h2>Why rebrand?</h2>
<p>We’ve evolved since our founding in 2013, and our new look and feel represents who we are now. It&#8217;s bold, optimistic, and full of energy, inspired by the initiative, focus, and momentum of our customers.</p>
<p>You can see this in action on the product dashboard and on our website, with bright colors, black and white photography of real business owners, and clean design. We’ve also incorporated dynamic brushstrokes, representing energy and forward movement—inspired by the determination we see our customers bring to their businesses, and the passion that our employees bring to work every day.</p>
<p>We worked with <a href="https://design.studio/">DesignStudio</a>, alongside our internal design team, in a yearlong collaborative process to bring this new brand to life. Beginning with a deep dive into our history, our customers, case studies, product roadmap, and aspirations, we incorporated hundreds of real Fundbox stories into what became our new brand.</p>
<h2>Our principles</h2>
<p>We express our brand principles by always striving to be transparent, direct, and focused on the future. You’ll always know where you stand with us, and we’ll do our best to communicate clearly. We exist to empower our customers, helping them achieve their business goals. The way we communicate is part of that.</p>
<h2>Our logo</h2>
<p>Our new logo is confident, energetic, and expresses the movement element of our brand. The logotype is accessible and friendly, and we emphasize the word “Fund” with an expressive stroke, to clearly communicate how we help businesses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12661" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LogoShowcase@2x.gif" alt="Fundbox logo animation" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>Our primary typeface is Roobert, a geometric, sans-serif font family. The type contains some distinctive features, like the rounded corner of the “G” and some quirky punctuation marks. We’re drawn to these unique details coupled with the boldness and strong legibility of the type in print and onscreen.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12664" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TypographyShowcase@2x.png" alt="Fundbox typography Roobert" width="600" height="182" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TypographyShowcase@2x.png 1320w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TypographyShowcase@2x-768x233.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>We use type in black or white, to emphasize ease of reading. This is important to us because directness and transparency are two of our most important goals with any of our communications.</p>
<h2>Color palette</h2>
<p>We use a dynamic color palette, consisting of ten brand colors, plus black and white. We use both light and dark versions of blue, orange, coral, sand, and pink in tonal combinations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12660" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ColorsSystem@2x.png" alt="Fundbox brand colors 2019" width="600" height="200" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ColorsSystem@2x.png 1320w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ColorsSystem@2x-768x256.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12662" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LogosinColors@2x.png" alt="Fundbox logos and colors" width="601" height="349" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LogosinColors@2x.png 1320w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/LogosinColors@2x-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>This departure from our previous visual identity signals a few things. The colors are bright, striking, and fearless with an element of fun. While ten may sound like a lot of brand colors, we use them in well-defined ways within a cohesive design system, ensuring that the effect is clear while remaining flexible.</p>
<h2>Visual direction</h2>
<p>Our photography uses a documentary style, showing real people in diverse types of work environments. With this photography, we aim to expand the idea of what a successful business owner looks like. We use black and white imagery, to give photographs a quality of permanence and weight, recalling the look of film and celebrating the focus, grit, and dignity of business owners. We tell stories about courageous entrepreneurs in action and motion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12663" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PhotographyShowcase@2x.jpg" alt="Fundbox art direction 2019" width="600" height="625" /></p>
<p>An important part of our visual direction is the use of thick brushstrokes. Inspired by the passionate, in-the-moment, free-hand markings of entrepreneurs in the midst of their work, these expressive strokes are the determined, progress-focused emphasis marks drawn in business meetings, on blueprints, or on drafts. The marks connect us with the feeling of being in the zone, working with focus and determination to create something new.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12659" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BrushesShowcase@2x.png" alt="Fundbox brand expressions" width="601" height="293" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BrushesShowcase@2x.png 1320w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BrushesShowcase@2x-768x375.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12658" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BigadsShowcase@2x.jpg" alt="Fundbox brand ads" width="600" height="630" /></p>
<h2>Looking forward</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we’ve made an effort to consider and improve every aspect of our brand, from the inside out. We want to extend our thanks to DesignStudio, who worked with us to help uncover and express our new brand, and our fantastic Design and UX teams in Tel Aviv and San Francisco.</p>
<p>We hope that as you experience our services, you’ll be delighted at the clarity and ease of use. As we continue to evolve, we’ll keep moving forward, making changes and improvements to better serve our customers and partners.</p>

Today, we’re in Tel Aviv, Israel, to meet Dean Ad, Fraud Risk Analyst.</p>
<p>Dean has been with Fundbox for two years. In that time, he has helped expand the company’s fraud-detection and prevention capabilities. Passionate and focused on learning every detail about how fraud works and how to stop it, he has spent his time at Fundbox getting to know the business customers we serve while learning about everything related to fraud prevention.</p>
<p>In this Q&amp;A, Dean shares how he works to prevent fraud, analyze new accounts, and protect the security of our customers and the company.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12505" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-600 wp-image-12505" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Dean-Ad.jpeg" alt="Fundbox fraud analyst Dean" width="600" height="460" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12505" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Dean Ad, Fraud Risk Analyst at Fundbox.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>What do you do at Fundbox?</h2>
<p><strong>Dean Ad</strong>: At Fundbox, I work as a Fraud Analyst. What I do is try to prevent fraud and try to keep our customers safe and keep our company safe, too. That means either trying to stop fraudulent applications that will try to abuse financial systems or halt fraudulent applications that hurt innocent people who’ve been victimized by fraudsters.</p>
<p>When I say “fraud” I mean unauthorized credit activity: credit fraud. Fraud occurs when someone tries to apply for credit, with the sole intent of obtaining funds, without the intent of paying them back. Within that explanation, there are a few different types of fraud. My team and I work on preventing all different types of fraud.</p>
<h2>As a financial technology company, we take fraud and data privacy seriously. What are some of the things we do to protect Fundbox users—and ourselves?</h2>
<p>Because of the nature of our work, I can’t give too many specific details—we wouldn’t want to give potential fraudsters any tips!</p>
<p>However, I can tell you a little bit. Our team does a lot of analysis and verification in order to ensure that any person applying for an account is the real person behind that information.</p>
<p>When it comes to data privacy, we do the best we can to keep that information safe with highly qualified tools. I wish I could say more, but part of protecting our customers is protecting exactly how we do it.</p>
<h2>Why do you think users feel safe using Fundbox?</h2>
<p>I spent some time working in Customer Support, so I’ve worked a lot with customers very closely. I think we have built a very solid track record with our customers.</p>
<p>For me, the fact that Fundbox is such a reliable company with thousands of <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/fundbox.com">TrustPilot</a> ratings and positive reviews online really stands out. We can point to thousands of happy customers that say that we have changed their lives by helping their business in a time of need.</p>
<p>Some people do get worried about connecting a bank data source to us online. However, it’s important for those people to understand that we never, ever save or share anyone’s bank login credentials. Connecting a data source is used to help our customers receive a more accurate credit decision. If we have more information about you, then your whole business health is taken into consideration, not just one piece. I think we are pro-business here, we really try to help businesses, and they can see that.</p>
<h2>What is your team like at Fundbox?</h2>
<p>Our fraud team includes employees both here in Tel Aviv, Israel, where I work, and at our headquarters in San Francisco. The two parts of the team share some overlap in what we do. For example, both teams analyze new accounts, and we both occasionally speak to customers to make sure that we have the information that we need to make sure that there is no fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>The team here in Israel also does a lot of analysis of past attempts at fraud in order to continually improve our fraud prevention capabilities, create new tools to prevent fraud, and make sure that our fraud rules are accurate at catching all the bad guys with minimal returning of false positives. It&#8217;s sort of like fraud R&amp;D.</p>
<p>For security and confidentiality reasons, I can’t give you too much detail about the team, but I can say it’s an amazingly smart group and I love being part of it.</p>
<h2>What did you do before Fundbox? What prepared you to work in fraud?</h2>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t set out to work in fraud, but my path brought me here. Like many Israelis, I spent time in the Israeli army. After the army, I moved to the United States, to New York, where I worked at the Israeli consulate. In Israel, typically after you finish the army, you start studying, so I studied economics in a remote university program.</p>
<p>I always planned to go back to Israel, and when I got an offer for a role at Fundbox, it was such a great opportunity; I decided to go for it.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I started in Customer Support, and that taught me everything about the product and about our systems. Over time, I started working with the fraud department, becoming a liaison between Risk, Fraud, and Support. That gave me a lot of experience with talking to customers and reviewing suspicious accounts. When there was a job opening on the Fraud team, I applied, went through the interview process, and got the job.</p>
<p>Being a good fraud analyst requires some strong instincts, and I’m proud of my instincts. On top of those, I’ve learned so much from people who were here for years before me. It’s been an incredible education.</p>
<h2>What did you do in the army? Was it related to finance?</h2>
<p>No, not at all. I was a Jumpmaster: a skydiving instructor!</p>
<p>I still teach people how to skydive—how to do military skydives. That was my role. It was super fun. I did a lot of jumps and worked with some of the best units in Israel. That was super cool! I’ve made over 200 jumps.</p>
<h2>Has anything at this company surprised you?</h2>
<p>Yes, I have definitely been surprised at times. I was thinking about that: We had a company trip to Eilat two weeks ago. I remember just standing there and realizing how many people I genuinely like at this company, how many real friends I have here, who I see outside of work. That doesn&#8217;t happen everywhere I’ve been.</p>
<p>The people here are really amazing. I’ve been surprised by the people here in a very good way.</p>

This month, we head to Tel Aviv, Israel, to meet Danielle Shaul. A three-year veteran of Fundbox, Danielle leads the Risk and Compliance Operations Team.</p>
<p>In this conversation, Danielle shares how she got into programming, her time in the Israeli army, and how’s she’s helping build a strong local community of female engineers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12362" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-600 wp-image-12362" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Danielle-Shaul-BW.png" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Danielle-Shaul-BW.png 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Danielle-Shaul-BW-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12362" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Danielle Shaul, Risk and Compliance Operations Team lead at Fundbox, with her dog, Alex.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>What’s your role at Fundbox? What’s a typical day like?</h3>
<p><strong>Danielle Shaul:</strong> For about two years now I&#8217;ve been managing a Risk team, consisting of four talented engineers, which develops Fundbox’s core IP: the logic behind the underwriting process. As part of our daily routine, we implement models, rules, and Fundbox’s policies.</p>
<p>My typical day is really busy! My job requires task management—it’s very hands-on. I spend some time in programming, working with the team and in meetings with other departments here in Fundbox as well as third parties and Fundbox’s partners. Risk is a dense area for Fundbox which is handled from many angles: we have a team of data scientists, a team of analytics folks, a team of engineers, and recently we hired a credit team in Texas.</p>
<h3>When did you join Fundbox? What has your experience been here?</h3>
<p>I joined Fundbox three years ago. I started as a developer on the payments team and then was promoted to manage the Compliance Risk team. After that, I moved to my current role, a Risk Team Leader.</p>
<p>When I joined, we had around 50 employees in the Tel Aviv office. Now there are more than 100. My team has also grown in that time. At first, it was a one-person job whereas today we have more products, multiple flows, and processes are becoming a lot more complicated.</p>
<h3>Previous to Fundbox, you&#8217;ve had some interesting jobs, including working with the Israeli Intelligence Corps and working as a software developer. Can you comment on your career path?</h3>
<p>My technological career has begun during my military service. In Israel, it is mandatory to serve in the army. I was enlisted to an Israeli technological Intelligence unit. For me, it was natural to start there and then move towards more technical areas. When I was in school afterward, my student job was to give lectures about programming. That is when I understood that I really like coding and I’m still doing that today.</p>
<p>I think the first time I discovered my passion was back in high school. I took computer science as my major and I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I broadened my knowledge by practicing from an early age. In high school, for instance, I started doing little projects, building some websites for some people I knew and learning on the go.</p>
<h3>How did you find Fundbox and what made you interested in joining?</h3>
<p>A friend of mine who was a recruiter told me, &#8220;I&#8217;m working at an amazing company. You have to come and hear about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I came in for an interview with two really tough, brilliant engineers. I was so impressed by the conversations we had. Once I was hired, I was shocked and so proud to be part of this organization. I could not believe I was one of them.</p>
<h3>What do you find interesting about this company?</h3>
<p>What I really like here are the people and the fact that the original culture is kept even though the company is constantly growing.</p>
<p>The devotion and the atmosphere here are really unique; people are always friendly and hardworking. This is something that I noticed from the very beginning and I still see it today. It&#8217;s rare that companies keep that in their DNA while they grow.</p>
<p>I really believe in Fundbox’s products. They may change, but we always keep in mind our main goal: helping small businesses. That’s something I find valuable.</p>
<h3>Can you talk about how what you do connects with our mission?</h3>
<p>What my team does contributes to how Fundbox’s automated process works. The algorithm we designed estimates whether an applicant is qualified for funding and if so, what would be the credit limit that Fundbox will provide them. That affects the financial power we can help them gain. If approved, we try to assist those business and give them the highest credit limit amount as possible, in consideration with our limitation since we don&#8217;t want to lose money. It requires coordinating between the credit amount and the risk we are willing to take. That mission is highly related to what my team does.</p>
<p>Anytime we modify a model or a policy, that’s having a direct influence on our underwriting process.</p>
<h3>Recently in Tel Aviv, you presented at an event called WomenHack.</h3>
<p>Yes, I gave a talk at <a href="https://womenhack.com/">WomenHack</a> about Fundbox, our operation and a little bit about us as employees and people. This event draws many women who are looking for their next challenge, seeking to get to know different companies in the high tech industry. When our Head of People, Iris Feinmesser told me, &#8220;There&#8217;s a really nice recruiting event for women,&#8221; I was interested in going. Several of us from the office attended as well and there was a good vibe around!</p>
<p>We’re making an effort to attract more women as we build our engineering team in Tel Aviv. We would like to be more involved in the local engineering community in general, and we also currently have our own engineering women community inside Fundbox.</p>
<p>There are still gaps, especially in the tech industry, between how women appreciate themselves and how they approach certain jobs or positions [when compared with men]. I think events like this can give women more confidence.</p>
<p>Community building is really important in order to encourage women and educating people that women can handle these technical positions; it should be well known that there are really talented women who are already doing them.</p>
<h3>What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in working at a place like Fundbox? Who thrives here?</h3>
<p>First, believe in what you do and believe that you&#8217;re good enough to get your dream job.</p>
<p>When I joined Fundbox I thought, &#8220;These people are very talented. I&#8217;m not at their level.&#8221; I was so impressed by them and I wanted to be part of this team. Believe in yourself, work hard, and you’ll get there.</p>
<p>One more tip: networking. As I said, the person who got me to Fundbox is someone I worked with at my previous job. Networking is super important, especially in the tech industry. If you work hard and people appreciate your work, they’ll want to work with you again.</p>
<p>Who thrives here? I think the most important thing would be good communication skills. The company currently has three different offices and many different teams. Almost all the projects that I work on involve other team members as well. Therefore, good communication which motivates and encourages them to be on board is super important. It can be the difference between doing something good and doing something awesome.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of some of the biggest news, awards, and new partnerships we announced over the past few months.</p>
<h2>Report: Trade credit’s $3.1T squeeze on businesses</h2>
<p>We sponsored a survey of United States businesses by media partner PYMNTS, to uncover the extent of the impact of offering net terms. The results were astounding.</p>
<p>“There are few areas of the economy in which millions of dollars in goods and services could be received solely with an IOU. Yet, such a system prevails for the millions of U.S. businesses that engage in trade credit relationships with their business partners. One eye-popping figure demonstrates just how prevalent the “buy now, pay later” B2B payment practice has become: $3.1 trillion is the net amount U.S. firms are owed in accounts receivable on any given day,” according to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/">PYMNTS</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Launch: OroCommerce teams with Fundbox</h2>
<p>OroCommerce, the B2B e-commerce software provider, selected Fundbox to offer the Oro’s marketplace customers a powerful new checkout solution that unites fast credit decisions with on-demand access to trade financing. Owned by Oro, Inc, a company that was founded in 2012 by industry leaders in open-source business application development, OroCommerce is dedicated to revolutionizing B2B commerce through digital transformation.</p>
<p>PYMNTS reported on the partnership: &#8220;Trade credit has been around for decades and is less than efficient, with $3.1 trillion tied up in outstanding invoices. To grease the wheels of commerce, Fundbox and OroCommerce are joining forces to provide B2B credit through the two-sided platform model. Jason Smith, vice president of business development and partnerships at Fundbox, tells PYMNTS that a data-driven, machine learning-enabled model makes all the difference between access to capital — and turns gridlock into growth.&#8221;</p>

</ul>
<h2>Launch: AND CO + Fundbox integration for freelancers</h2>
<p>We’ve launched our integration partnership with AND CO, enabling approved freelancers to get faster access to credit than ever before, all from within their AND CO workflows.</p>
<p>AND CO wrote on their blog: “71% of freelancers have trouble getting paid at some point in their career. Worse still, among those freelancers, 81% are paid late and 34% are completely ghosted.  Apart from being stressful, unpaid invoices can interrupt your ability to keep performing the activities that will grow your business. &#8230;Our new integration with Fundbox can help you get access to business funds right from your AND CO dashboard.”</p>

<h2>Award: FinTech Breakthrough</h2>
<p>For the second year in a row, we were honored by FinTech Breakthrough, this time as the <a href="https://fintechbreakthrough.com/">winner</a> of the “Best B2B Payments Platform” award. FinTech Breakthrough, an independent organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies, and products in the global FinTech market today, announced the winners in April.</p>
<p>“In today’s global economy businesses should no longer be bogged down with slow and inefficient transaction processes that can significantly impede a business’ growth,” said James Johnson, Managing Director, FinTech Breakthrough. “Fundbox Pay is reimagining the way that B2B companies pay and get paid with modern, digital payment processes that deliver the speed, certainty, and convenience of B2C transactions to the world of B2B. Congratulations to Fundbox on their well-deserved 2019 FinTech Breakthrough Award designation.”</p>

<h2>Award: Israel’s 50 most promising startups</h2>
<p>On a star-studded list from Calcalist Tech, Fundbox appeared as one of three “fintech stars taking over the American market.”</p>
<p>“Fundbox’s quick success led it to chart a new goal—establishing a B2B credit network. Fundbox’s unique strategy sees it going after suppliers to assure they receive payment through the Fundbox platform, leading to organic expansion.
