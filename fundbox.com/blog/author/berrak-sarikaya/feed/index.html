										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Could an equipment loan help improve you improve your restaurant or small business?" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Technology moves pretty fast these days, and as a small business owner, you need to make sure your equipment can keep up with demand. Traditionally, most business owners use an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/equipment-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=EquipmentLoan&amp;keywords=1">equipment loan</a></span> to finance new or upgraded equipment like heavy machinery, trucks for a delivery business, or ovens for a restaurant. However, you can get innovative with how you use <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/equipment-financing/">equipment financing</a></span> for your small business.</p>
<h2>First, what is an equipment loan?</h2>
<p>Business equipment loans help business owners acquire equipment that would normally be too expensive to buy with cash. The equipment you’re financing can also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/blog/small-business-insights/collateral-secure-business-loan/">act as your collateral</a></span>, which means you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-business-loans/">secure a loan without spending money</a></span> upfront. Most lenders will require you to be in business at least 12 months with $50,000 or more in annual revenue, and a credit score of 650 or higher.</p>
<p>Since every type of business has specific needs, there are small business equipment financing options for nearly every industry. Equipment loans are relatively easy to obtain (when compared with traditional term loans), and they help preserve cash flow for your small business. There are restrictions, though: with most types of equipment loan, you can <em>only</em> use the capital to buy the specified equipment, which means you should have a plan for exactly what type of equipment you need and what the return on investment will be.</p>
<h2>Get creative with equipment in your small business</h2>
<p>With the right equipment, you can not only increase efficiency in your business, but also customer and employee loyalty. Beyond using equipment financing to buy the tools you need to operate or for major operational upgrades, consider using equipment loans for smaller pieces of technology that will have a big impact on your customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase tablets to empower your customers</span>.</h3>
<p>With the right software, you can turn tablets into assets that will further engage your customers and allow you to provide better service to them. If you’re a restaurant or cafe with made-to-order items, you can give customers a chance to review their options before they approach the register. If you’re a beauty salon owner, you can skip the mass-produced catalogues and use tablets to provide examples of your own work, or styles hand-picked by your staff, to provide a more customized experience for customers in your salon.</p>
<p>Since customer reviews are critical for small businesses, use tablets to provide an opportunity for your customers to leave a review of their experience before they leave. Have stations set-up with tablets to make it easy for happy customers to leave positive feedback while the experience is top of mind.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9592" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9592" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128.jpg" alt="Point of sale (POS) systems and touch screens" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9592" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Flexible point of sale (POS) systems and touch screens can help you increase efficiency.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invest in a flexible POS (point of sale) system to increase efficiency.</span></h3>
<p>A smooth checkout process is beneficial to both your business efficiency and customer satisfaction, and with a POS system that takes multiple factors and needs into consideration, your small business can increase its revenue. There are a couple of factors to consider when upgrading your POS system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you offer mobile services? Say you have a towing company. With a mobile POS system, your drivers can accept payment from customers on the spot, eliminating paperwork. With plug-and-play options like Square and PayPal, your employees won’t need to carry around special equipment; all they need is a compatible smartphone.</li>
<li>Does your industry have specific needs? Restaurants in particular need to have POS systems that understand the nuances of menu layouts, invoicing, and time clocks. If you have a business with a lot of inventory or multiple locations, you’ll need to invest in a POS system that can accommodate those needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Go green: use equipment loans to become more energy-efficient.</span></h3>
<p>In addition to being environmentally-friendly, having a green business comes with tax incentives. There are a few relatively easy ways to become an eco-friendly business with equipment loans:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buy ENERGYSTAR-qualified equipment. </span>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/">ENERGYSTAR</a></span>-rated appliance has been evaluated and deemed energy-efficient, which can save you money and help you manage energy costs.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade to a smart thermostat. </span>With a range of energy-saving features like motion sensors that detect when people are present, smart thermostats can take the hassle out of managing the temperature at your store or place of business while saving you money. Win-win.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch to laptop computers.</span> On average, laptop computers are more efficient and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html">use 80 percent less energy</a></span> than desktop computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the right plan, you can make a lasting impact on your business using equipment financing. Once you have the right tools you need to operate, shift your focus to using equipment loans to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_310620167-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_310620167-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_310620167.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>According to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t04.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span>, three million employees have chosen to leave their jobs each month since June 2017. In an increasingly competitive business world, top talent is in high demand.</p>
<p>This kind of employee turnover is expensive—especially for a small business. Think of every employee you hire as an investment in your business. Only when your employees are happy and engaged can you maximize your return on that investment.</p>
<p>Here are six ways to increase employee retention:</p>
<h2>1. Build a great company culture</h2>
<p>You don’t have to have a ping pong table in the break room to have an attractive company culture. Instead, think about how your culture can match the type of people you want to employ. It’s helpful to have clearly-defined values as a small business so you can build your company culture and hiring criteria around them.</p>
<p>Another key factor in an attractive company culture is creating an employment value proposition that goes beyond monetary compensation. Be transparent from the start about the experiences your employees will benefit from while working with your company—then be sure you deliver.</p>
<h2>2. Hire the right employees</h2>
<p>When running a small business, you may feel you don’t have time to be selective about hiring. But the truth is you can’t afford to <em>not</em> be particular. While you may be tempted to hire fast when you’re short staffed or overburdened, it’s critical to hire the right employee for the job to save time and money in the long run.</p>
<p>As you’re screening and interviewing candidates, pay attention to signs that they may be a job-hopper or not a great culture fit for your business and customers. Even a part-time employee should be a solid fit for your business from the get-go.</p>
<h2>3. Identify your employees&#8217; passions and strengths</h2>
<p>In a small business, garnering employee loyalty starts with helping team members feel passionate about the company and their contributions. As a manager, you should also be supportive of your employees’ career goals and creating career advancement opportunities for them. Understand their past accomplishments, ask them about their aspirations, and work together to discover how those intersect with the goals of your business.</p>
<p>Taking the time to draw out passions and strengths your employees may not have listed on their resumes could be beneficial to the growth of your company. You may have a sales rep with a passion for web development or an accountant with a penchant for event planning, but you might not ever find out unless you ask. Create a career development plan for your employees that will combine their strengths and passions with the needs of your business.</p>
<h2>4. Provide guidance without micromanaging</h2>
<p>Your small business is your passion, and more often than not, running it takes up the majority of your time. It can be hard to step back, delegate, and let go, which is why you need to hire employees you trust. While it’s important to have clear communication and expectations as a leader, you also want to empower your employees. Give them room to take the lead in their individual roles and in the business without your constant oversight.</p>
<p>Of course, for this to be effective, your employees need regular feedback. Use feedback as a tool for growth and recognition, with specific recommendations for further improvement and development. Build in time to check in with your employees to make sure you’re also addressing their concerns, and to ensure they’re still feeling aligned with their career development plans.</p>
<h2>5. Offer career growth and training incentives</h2>
<p>In addition to paying your employees well, provide incentives for their career growth. This could be in the form of a small stipend they use for taking classes, buying books, or attending professional events.</p>
<p>Another effective way to foster growth is through empowering your employees to learn from each other. Think back to those individual passions and strengths. Ask one of your employees to teach an in-house workshop in their area of expertise. If you have employees who are taking classes or attending conferences, encourage them to share some key takeaways with their colleagues. All of these training opportunities will enhance the attractive company culture you’ve worked hard to build.</p>
<h2>6. Recognize and reward good work</h2>
<p>You want your employees to feel valued, so make sure you’re giving them the recognition they deserve. This doesn’t always have to be done with a bonus or salary increase. Recognizing a job well done individually and also company-wide can be rewarding enough for employees. Try recognizing their hard work in a company-wide email or letting them take the lead on a specific, high-profile project within the business.</p>
<p>When employees feel undervalued and unappreciated, they start looking for opportunities elsewhere. Small businesses must focus on superb company culture, smart hiring, growth and development opportunities, plenty of freedom and incentives, and rewards for a job well done. These methods of increasing employee retention will not only save on employee turnover costs, but most importantly, create an environment where talented people become integral parts of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/simple-small-business-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=EmployeeRetention&amp;keywords=1">helping your small business grow</a></span> in the long-term.</p>

Although they’re generating incredible amounts of revenue, most women-owned businesses are considered small businesses since they have fewer than 500 employees.</p>
<p>While nearly all small business owners are familiar with the challenge of getting access to capital, for women-owned small businesses, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/blog/small-business-tools/women-making-strides-small-business-despite-gender-gap-funding/">challenge is compounded</a></span>. On average, women entrepreneurs get <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/07/lending-gap-for-women-business-owners-continues-to-widen.html">50% less funding</a></span> than their male counterparts and in 2017, female founders received just <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/">2% of venture capital dollars</a></span>.</p>
<p>These statistics show that women-owned businesses are key to our nation’s overall economic success, and their importance is only growing stronger. But without broadened access to startup and growth capital, those businesses can’t reach their full potential. Several initiatives such as grants and federally sponsored funding have been established to help bridge the funding gap, as well as more widespread access to business financing through online lenders.</p>
<p>Here are three ways women-owned small businesses can get the funds they need to dream a little bigger.</p>
<h2>1. Apply for a small business loan</h2>
<p>Women-owned businesses can get funding through loans from traditional banking institutions, peer-to-peer lenders, or online lenders, and each has its pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying for a loan from a traditional bank</span> is time consuming and will likely require <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-business-loans/">collateral</a></span>. While it’s one of the more inexpensive forms of financing out there, there’s no guarantee that the application process will pay off. Studies show that women business owners make <span style="text-decoration: underline;">multiple attempts</span> to secure bank loans or lines of credit, and 40 percent of women business owners applying for a loan never succeed in obtaining funding. Additionally, loans to women make up only about 4 percent of all commercial loan dollars.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms</span> act as a bridge between small business owners in need of funding and banks and investors who are willing to lend it. While they’re fast and easy to obtain if a business is in good standing (with a credit score over 600), they can come with a hefty interest rate, and require due diligence in calculating the true cost of the capital.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Online lenders</span> use the latest technology to expand working capital solutions for small businesses. Because these lenders take into consideration factors like online sales, cash flow, bank transactions, and other data, traditional qualifiers like credit score and collateral are not as vital in securing a loan, making this type of financing much more accessible. Outside of the traditional business loan, female business owners may consider applying for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/business-line-of-credit?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=3WaysWomenOwnedFunding&amp;keywords=1">business line of credit</a></span> that can serve as a flexible option for growing a business, including hiring more employees, purchasing new equipment, and taking marketing efforts to the next level.</li>
</ul>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9329" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_547890676.jpg" alt="Apply for a grant" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_547890676.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_547890676-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></h2>
<h2>2. Apply for a private small business grant</h2>
<p>As opposed to business credit cards, lines of credit, or loans, grants for small businesses are essentially free financing, which is why the competition for them is fierce. The funds can usually be allocated to very specific purposes, making grants <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/news/women-in-business/grants-women/">a great supplemental form of funding</a></span> for qualified female entrepreneurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cartierwomensinitiative.com/">Cartier Women’s Initiative Award</a></span> is great for female entrepreneurs just getting their business off the ground. Once a year, 18 female entrepreneurs will receive either a first prize of $100,000 and one-on-one business mentoring, or a second prize of $30,0000. Additionally, each of the finalists will also receive a spot in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.insead.edu/executive-education/entrepreneurship-family-business/social-entrepreneurship-programme">INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship 6-Day Executive Program (ISEP)</a></span>.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ambergrantsforwomen.com/get-an-amber-grant/?utm_expid=16497869-50.q2f8YOaKQg-BgO77JhkXdQ.1&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fambergrantsforwomen.com%2Fabout-us%2Ffaq-online-grants-for-women%2F">Amber Grant Foundation</a></span> awards $10,000 to a different women-owned business every month. The winners for the monthly grants also qualify for the annual $25,000 Amber Grant, which will be awarded at the end of the year to one of 12 qualifiers.</li>
<li>For those in business for three years or more, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.eileenfisher.com/grants/grants-overview/">Eileen Fisher Women-Owned Business Grant Program</a></span> is another great funding option for women-owned small businesses. There are a few eligibility caveats: women must make up at least 51% of the business ownership, the business must have less than $1 million in annual revenue, and the business must be focused on environmental or social change.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/openmeadowsfoundation/">Open Meadows Foundation</a></span> awards $2,000 grants toward women-backed projects that promote gender, racial, and economic justice. Open Meadows only considers organizations that have no more than $75,000 in budget resources and it reviews proposals in cycles throughout the year.</li>
<li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://smallbusiness.fedex.com/grant-contest.html">FedEx Small Business Grant</a></span> is open to all small business applicants, but the majority of the winners have been women-owned businesses. In fact, the very first grant winner was a woman.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Seek out federally-sponsored funding</h2>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/wbo/">Small Business Administration</a></span> (SBA) provides funding for entrepreneurs around the country in the form of grants and small business loans. The Women’s Business Center is a great <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/news/women-in-business/sba-female-entrepreneurs/">resource for female entrepreneurs</a></span>, which includes a database of organizations that award grants to women on a local level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/">InnovateHER Challenge</a></span>, the SBA awards three female small business owners a total of $70,000 in prize money.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html">Grants.gov</a></span> is a database of federally sponsored grants, including grants for small businesses. To view grants specifically for small businesses, filter the results of the page under “eligibility.”</li>
<li>The SBA also offers small business loans through partnerships with financial firms. These loans tend to have lower interest rates because the SBA puts a ceiling on how much money approved lenders can make off each loan. Be aware that SBA loans can take a long time to secure, so if you’re looking for quick financing, look for other options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Women-owned businesses are a critical part of the U.S. financial ecosystem, and while the lending landscape is improving for them through more business loan options, private grants, and federally-sponsored funding, they’re still being underserved. To close the funding gap between female entrepreneurs and their male counterparts, organizations must continue to rally around women in small business, forming programs, initiatives, and legislation in support of female small business owners.</p>
