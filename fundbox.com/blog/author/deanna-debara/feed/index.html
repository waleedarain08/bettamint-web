And a huge part of that growth? Hiring the right team. In this post, the former recruiter breaks down the step-by-step process for finding and hiring the best virtual assistants in the digital space. </span></p>
<h2>How to Hire a Virtual Assistant for Your Business</h2>
<p>The most successful entrepreneurs and business owners know that it takes a village to build a successful business. If you want to take your business to the next level, you need to hire the right team.</p>
<p>Not that long ago, your talent pool was limited to your immediate area. But thanks to technology, you can hire the best person for the job, whether they’re 10 miles or 10,000 miles away.</p>
<p>Hiring the right digital team—and, in particular, the right virtual assistant (VA)—can completely revolutionize your business. The process can be intimidating, especially if you haven’t done it before. You’ll need to consider: Where do you look for talent? How do you know if someone is the right person for the job? How do you manage the interview process when your potential assistant is on the other side of the globe?</p>
<p>Luckily, finding the right VA is all a matter of following the right process.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a step-by-step breakdown of how to find and hire the best talent online:</p>
<h2>Step 1: Know where to look for a VA</h2>
<p>The first step to finding the right online team?</p>
<p>Knowing where to look.</p>
<p>There are a crazy amount of websites advertising freelance talent on the web, but not all freelance sites are created equal. If you want to find the right VA, you have to know where to look.</p>
<p>When it comes to VAs, there’s no better place than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs-home/2664422">Upwork</a></span>. With over 14 million active users, Upwork is the internet’s largest database of online talent, and a huge percentage of that talent specializes in administrative work. And with virtual assistants all over the world, there’s amazing talent at every price point—so finding a great assistant that fits your budget won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>There are other sites that have a decent amount of VA talent (like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a></span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.onlinejobs.ph/">Onlinejobs.ph</a></span>), but it’s definitely a narrow talent pool. If you want to cast the widest net, stick with Upwork.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Write the perfect job ad to find the right VA</h2>
<p>The next step to finding the perfect VA is writing the perfect job ad.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake you can make when writing a job ad is making it all about you: what you’re looking for, what you need, and what you expect from your new VA.</p>
<p>But if you want your job ad to attract the right talent, it can’t be about you. It needs to be about them.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of your job ad is to attract the right talent. So think of it like an advertisement—and the product you’re selling is the job. Your job ad should highlight the benefits of the position. Do you offer flexible work hours? Are you offering any special training? Do you have an especially awesome work environment? Whatever it is that makes the job special, make sure its front and center in your job ad.</p>
<p>Remember: the best virtual assistants have plenty of opportunities. Your job ad needs to sell them on why your opportunity is the right one for them.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Use the “screener trick”</h2>
<p>Two of the most important qualities you need in a virtual assistant is attention to detail and the ability to follow direction.</p>
<p>And there’s an easy trick you can use to determine which candidates possess those two qualities without ever reading their resume or cover letter—and that’s adding a screener question to your job ad.</p>
<p>Somewhere in your job ad copy, add a specific instruction for candidates to follow. So, for example, you might say “Send a copy of your resume using the subject line ‘Resume from [your name] for VA.’”</p>
<p>Adding this simple line of text will show you which candidates have attention to detail (since they read the entire job ad) and know how to follow direction and will allow you to immediately eliminate the candidates who don’t. This can save you a ton of time in the screening process.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Take a test drive</h2>
<p>You wouldn’t commit to a five-year lease on a car before a test drive, would you?</p>
<p>So why would you commit to a long-term relationship with a virtual assistant before trying them out?</p>
<p>Test projects are a great way to get a feel for whether a candidate is a good fit before making a hiring commitment. Once you’ve narrowed your options down to a few quality candidates, assign each of them a sample project. It’s helpful to give each candidate the same project so you can compare apples to apples, and you also want to make sure the test project is in line with what they’d actually be doing once they’re hired. For example, if you need a virtual assistant to handle research, give them a small research-based test project.</p>
<p>One last thing about test projects: make sure you pay your candidates for their test project. It’s not fair to ask people to work for free—and if you do, it might give a negative impression of you to the best, most experienced candidates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10007" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_749570365.jpg" alt="Video interview for a virtual assistant" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_749570365.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_749570365-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step 5: Interview</h2>
<p>Once you get your test projects back, you should have a pretty good idea of which candidates you want to work with. Next, all that’s left is the interview.</p>
<p>When it comes to interviewing people online, keep things short and sweet. You basically just want to get a feel for someone’s personality, and whether their personality is going to mesh with yours.</p>
<p>Some things you’ll want to hit on during the interview process include: their experience as a VA, their comfort level with the technology your business uses (like QuickBooks for bookkeeping, ZenDesk for customer service, or Asana for project management), and their availability.</p>
<p>You also want to get a sense of their organizational skills, so if you can, schedule a video interview. If they claim to be super organized but their home office or bedroom is a complete disaster, they might not really have the chops for the job.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Make sure your assistant sticks around</h2>
<p>So, you’ve hired an amazing virtual assistant. Congratulations!</p>
<p>But finding and hiring the right talent is only the first part of the equation. Now, it’s important that you manage your amazing virtual assistant in a way that keeps them around.</p>
<p>Here are a few best practices for <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-retain-millennial-employees/">keeping quality talent</a> on your team:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invest in their growth</span>: If your VA feels like there are plenty of opportunities to learn and grow within the position, they’re more likely to stick around.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be consistent</span>: If you tell your VA you’re going to give them 20 hours of work per week, make sure you’re delivering on that promise.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Respect your assistant’s personal life</span>: Don’t expect them to work off-hours or to respond to emails on weekends, unless that’s explicitly part of their contract with you.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule regular check-ins:</span> Meetings to discuss their progress and how they’re enjoying the position will help you stay on the same page. That way, if they have any concerns, you can address them together, sooner rather than later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hiring online can be a challenge. But with this step-by-step guide, you have everything you need to find the right virtual assistant—the assistant that’s going to help take those repetitive tasks off your plate, so you can concentrate on taking your business to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="513" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_372069916-768x513.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_372069916-768x513.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_372069916.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p style="text-align: left;">In 2018, there are more female entrepreneurs than ever before. In fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are</span> 114% more female-owned businesses in the US than there were 20 years ago (that’s what we call progress!).</p>
<p>Katie Stoltz is one of those business owners. Stoltz spent 10 years working in management consulting but knew she’d eventually make the transition to owning her own business. “I have had the ‘entrepreneurial bug’ since I was a little girl,” says Stoltz. “When I was about seven years old I made a list of ‘100 ways to make money’—and one included renting my brother out on an hourly basis!”</p>
<p>Stoltz saw the opportunity to make the jump to entrepreneurship when a flurry of her friends started to get engaged. “I had 5 friends who were engaged at the same time. All of them were sending around Pinterest boards and Excel sheets detailing what they found after countless calls to endless amounts of venues,” says Stoltz. “I couldn&#8217;t understand why this was such a hard thing to track down! Why do you have to search for hours—days, really—to find out how much a venue costs and what they provide?”</p>
<p>As Stoltz watched her friends struggle to find locations for their weddings, she had an idea— what if she could replicate the short-term rental model for wedding venues? And her business, Venues and Vows, was born.</p>
<p>Today, Venues and Vows provides a heavily vetted collection of estates, mansions, farms, ranches, &#8220;glamping&#8221;, and beach houses for people&#8217;s most important and fun events, including weddings, elopements, and bachelor/bachelorette parties.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9684" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/KStoltz-profile.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9684" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/KStoltz-profile.jpg" alt="Katie Stoltz, founder of Venues &amp; Vows" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/KStoltz-profile.jpg 1476w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/KStoltz-profile-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9684" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Katie Stoltz, founder of Venues &amp; Vows</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We asked Stoltz to share some of her insights on what it’s like to be a female entrepreneur in 2018—the lessons she’s learned, the challenges she’s faced, and some of the most rewarding experiences she’s had as a business owner. Here’s what she had to say.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fundbox: </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">What have been some of your most rewarding experiences as an entrepreneur? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Katie Stoltz: As soon as you receive external validation from people outside of your friends and family, that feels great. For me, I was a semi-finalist for Rent The Runway/UBS&#8217;s Project Entrepreneur competition and I also won Bumble&#8217;s pitch competition. This validated that yes, this is a good idea and that people actually want to see this concept come to life because they would use it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are some things you wish you knew when you were starting out in business?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) A great idea doesn&#8217;t equal revenue. I ran many surveys to test whether Venues &amp; Vows was a viable business. The feedback I received was extraordinary and ultimately was the reason I decided to quit my consulting job. However, feedback doesn&#8217;t equate to awareness or revenue. So, executing on the idea and creating awareness is far more important than just having a great idea.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) Save money. Then save some more. I worked overseas for almost five years and was able to save a considerable amount of money to fund my startup. Still, you will find yourself at the end of your rope at some point. So, whatever you think will get you through your &#8220;runway&#8221;, double it!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) Stay energized. Some days you will think you are a mad genius for coming up with your business idea and other days you will literally question your sanity. Try to stay energized and positive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What have been some of the biggest challenges you&#8217;ve faced as a female entrepreneur? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Only <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/31/female-founders-venture-capital-2017/">2% of venture funding goes to women</a></span>, which is a truly astonishing number. Add to that mix that there are many, many talented women with great businesses fighting for the same pot and, you have a financing nightmare.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Additionally, and very unfortunately, you still get hit on and talked down to, regularly. A few examples: &#8220;You are going to be the prettiest girl at the venture capital prom,” &#8220;You need a male co-founder,” &#8220;When are you going to start popping kids out?&#8221; These are just a few of the comments I&#8217;ve received from men in the space.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think the biggest hurdle though is that it&#8217;s hard to communicate to men how difficult of a journey this is for women. If you have not experienced first-hand the everyday occurrences, it&#8217;s hard to wrap your head around how a sly comment or an eye-roll would affect your progress. Indeed, those do seem like small things but multiply them by 365 days [for] 20+ years and perhaps it&#8217;s easier to understand why fundraising and starting a business can sometimes seem insurmountable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What have been some hurdles you&#8217;ve faced in getting the financing you need to run your business effectively? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a constant tango of cash-in, cash-out and managing that flow is difficult because building awareness at a startup is crucial to its success. It&#8217;s often referred to as &#8220;chicken-and-the-egg&#8221;. For me, I need to be able to market—but to do that, I need money. However, investors want to see traction before they give you money.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Additionally, being a consumer-facing business that&#8217;s focused on women is a challenge. Most investors are men and many of them did not plan their wedding [and don’t understand the challenges in finding a venue].</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It&#8217;s also fascinating to hear about the vacillation of investors from one business to the next. Sometimes an idea is enough, yet other times you need recurring revenue of $50K/month. It can be very difficult to decipher how to approach different investors when their decision making process has not always been consistent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because of this, I have turned to alternative funding mechanisms. I recently was accepted into the iFundWomen accelerator which is similar (in concept) to KickStarter but is focused exclusively on women-owned businesses. Because I don&#8217;t have&#8230; someone who can bankroll Venues &amp; Vows, I need to reach out to my friends and family for small contributions—iFundWomen facilitates this.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How do you think the financial services industry could better serve female entrepreneurs? What would you like to see change?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unfortunately, this is a systemic problem that needs to be addressed at several levels. I actually think that if it were possible to create a &#8220;blind&#8221; application where you didn&#8217;t know if the person was female or male, that could be extremely advantageous to women. It has been proven time-and-time-again that men and women alike judge women harshly in a business environment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I also believe that a separate pot of money needs to be set aside for women-owned ventures within any investment group. Ideally this would be 50% of their fund but starting with at least 25% would be a great start.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I would really like to see men take a much more active role in creating the change necessary to get women funded. Creating a fund or loan for women would be a great first step. However, this should not be viewed as charity or as a donation. And for that reason, this should not be a grant/donation in the thousands &#8211; it should be in the millions. No viable business is going to get anywhere without significant investment made towards technology, marketing and systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the biggest lessons you&#8217;ve learned on your entrepreneurial journey? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">First: Network always.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Networking is legitimately a second job,but it is 100% necessary if you hope to be successful as an entrepreneur. This is not a one-person game—especially as a woman.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, planning is imperative.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ideas mean almost nothing in the startup world, which is why most investors refuse to sign NDA&#8217;s. Their theory is that your idea may be great but execution is what creates a solvent business. For this reason, planning and implementing a strategy across all business units is imperative.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third: Content is king.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Without awareness, your business is nothing. To build awareness, you must have content: videos, photos, blog posts, guest blog posts, Facebook, Instagram, advertising, partnerships, lead pages, SEO, PR, [and] media. They are all necessary if you hope to gain traction in any given market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What&#8217;s the one piece of advice you would give to the next generation of female entrepreneurs? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Research! Do research on many, many levels. First, make sure you run market studies to test the idea you are interested in implementing. Second, research the competitors and experts you can look to for comparisons and advice. Third, research fellow entrepreneurs who can help you along your path to growth. Fourth, be inquisitive enough to research alternative ways to the solution you came up with. There may be alternative revenue models or paths that can set your business onto a path of exponential growth. Always, always research before you delve into a venture of any kind!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And one more thing&#8230;keep on fighting for your business if you truly believe in it and <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> support other women in business. Without the support of one another, it will be difficult to level the playing field. In the words of Nina Shaw: <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;If you want to be a woman in power, then empower other women.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where do you see yourself—and Venues and Vows—in the next five years? </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I&#8217;d like to see the wedding venue industry fundamentally upended. Couples need a better, more cost efficient and flexible alternative to what’s offered in the market today. I also want to see a shift in the way we view weddings as a society. Weddings are literally meant to be a celebration of a couple&#8217;s love—not a demonstration of how much money can be spent on an event. It’s a time for friends and family to meet and spend time with the couple—and this can&#8217;t be done in a few hours. The concept of having a &#8220;wedding weekend&#8221; demonstrates how a couple can have quality time with their guests and create a weekend that everyone will remember.</p>

<p>When I started my own business, I really had no idea what I was getting myself into. I knew I didn’t want to work in corporate America anymore and I knew I wanted to be a writer—but that was pretty much it.</p>
<p>Because I was new to the entrepreneurial game, I made just about every mistake in the book as I worked to build my business. I was desperate for clients, so I took any opportunity that presented itself, even if that opportunity wasn’t aligned with my ultimate goals. I had no samples for my portfolio, so I wrote for anyone who would pay me, no matter how low the rate. I worked around the clock trying to get my business off the ground, but no matter how hard I worked, I couldn’t get past the 5K per month mark. Considering how many hours I was putting in, I started to wonder if this whole entrepreneur thing was actually worth it.</p>
<p>Once I learned these big lessons, everything changed.</p>
<p>Today, I’m happy to say that I’ve built a thriving six-figure business where I’m lucky enough to work with amazing clients on projects I’m really excited about, but it was a long road to get here.</p>
<p>Here are the four lessons I’ve learned that I wish I knew from the start.</p>
<h2>You can’t do everything on your own</h2>
<p>When I first started out, I was a one-woman show. I was, technically, a writer, but most of my time was spent doing everything else that was necessary to keep my business up and running, from looking for new leads to research to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-the-perfect-invoice/">invoicing</a></span> to admin work.</p>
<p>It took me a solid year to realize that all that time I was spending on “everything else” was time I wasn’t getting paid for—and my business was suffering as a result.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, if you want to build a successful business, you can’t do everything on your own. If you spend each day doing only your most profitable activities, your business is more likely to succeed. If you spend it doing “everything else”? Unfortunately, you’re going to struggle.</p>
<p>For me, I had to make a shift and stop trying to do everything on my own, so I decided to do what I do best (writing) and hire out the rest. And that’s when my business really started to thrive.</p>
<p>Today, I have a CPA who manages my finances and a virtual assistant who handles all my research and admin work, which frees me up to spend just about all my time writing—which not only brings more money into my business, but makes the time I spend working much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>At first, it was really hard to decide to hire help. But once I started looking at how I was spending my time (and how much time I was spending on things that didn’t drive any revenue), I realized I was never going to take my business to the next level until I got help.</p>
<p>For example, when I was a one-woman show, I was spending about 15 hours a week on administrative work. That was 15 hours a week I wasn’t billing clients, where I was making zero income. When I hired my virtual assistant, I was able to outsource my administrative tasks and free up those 15 hours for higher value work. The extra time I now have to focus on income-generating activities <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> than makes up for the cost of my assistant.</p>
<h2>If you don’t value what you do, neither will anyone else</h2>
<p>In the early days of my business, I didn’t place nearly enough value on my skills and talents, which led me to take on low-paying assignments that I should have declined. That wasn’t good for my morale, and it definitely wasn’t a sustainable way to build a business.</p>
<p>Over time, I gained more confidence in myself. When I changed my mindset and started valuing what I brought to the table, my entire business shifted. I began turning down work that wasn’t aligned with my financial goals—and as a result, I made room for better-paying clients in my schedule. I was confident in the way I pitched my services—and clients picked up on that confidence and wanted to work with me.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that if you don’t value what you do, neither will anyone else. When you know your own value, everyone else will know it, too.</p>
<h2>ABP (Always be pitching)</h2>
<p>In the early months of my business, I found myself in a repetitive “feast or famine” cycle. I’d pitch a few clients, get a few assignments, be super busy and spend all my time and energy getting those assignments finished, turn the assignments in, and then… nothing. I’d have no more work—and, as a result, no more income coming into my business.</p>
<p>This cycle was not only stressful, but it wasn’t sustainable. If I wanted my business to succeed, I needed a steadier cash flow.</p>
<p>It took me longer than I’d like to admit to figure out how to make that happen. It’s a little trick I call ABP: Always be pitching.</p>
<p>The reason I was in feast or famine mode is because I’d stop pitching once I landed an assignment. But the key to generating a steady flow of income is to ALWAYS be pitching new business. Not only does it make sure there’s plenty of work flowing into your business, it also protects you from getting too reliant on any specific client.</p>
<p>Today, I have a Post-It note on my computer that says “ABP” to remind me to reach out to at least five new potential clients each week. As a result, I’ve had a full client roster for the past year.</p>
<h2>Run your business like a business</h2>
<p>The last lesson I’d share with my early business self is this: run your business like a business. That might sound obvious, but hear me out.</p>
<p>Businesses need structure to thrive. But when you don’t have a boss breathing over your shoulder, because you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> the boss, it can be hard to implement that structure for yourself. I used to work odd hours, take days off in the middle of the week, and basically just do things based on what I felt like doing in that moment—not what was best for my business.</p>
<p>Today, I take my business more seriously. I have a set schedule and I stick to it. Running my business using schedules and advance planning has been a total gamechanger.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things I would tell my younger, more naïve self about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/double-business-growth-in-2018/">how to successfully grow a business</a></span>. But the most important thing I’d tell her? Keep going. It might be tough, but I promise—it’s totally worth it.</p>
