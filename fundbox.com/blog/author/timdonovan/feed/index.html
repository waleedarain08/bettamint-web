										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="576" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/snail-505511_1280-768x576.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Snail sitting on a car tire" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/snail-505511_1280-768x576.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/snail-505511_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>In this explanation of the ABCs of Accounting, we will discuss assets, liabilities, and equity, including the Owner&#8217;s Equity Formula, the Statement of Owner&#8217;s Equity, the Balance Sheet Formula, and other helpful equations. Fundamentally, accounting comes down to a simple equation. Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It seems simple enough but let’s really break it down. What do these terms mean in relation to your business and how can they help you make sense of the books?</p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever heard the phrase “Tom is an asset to the company”? The meaning is clear. Tom is a good worker that brings value to the organization. In accounting terms, an asset is any item of value to the company: tangible (property, inventory, equipment) or intangible (patents, trademarks, copyrights, accounts receivable and even reputation).</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how to calculate total assets:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider what assets you have, including any current, fixed, and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intangible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resources that could be of financial value to your business. For example:</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current assets (assets that can be converted into cash within one year or less) such as cash, outstanding invoices owed to you, and inventory that can be sold</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed assets (things of value that are harder to convert into cash) such as real estate, heavy machinery, furniture, vehicles, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term investments, like stocks and bonds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intangible assets that have value, such as your company’s brand, reputation, social media following, and your company&#8217;s or employees’ status as influencers</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a balance sheet—a financial statement that shows a company’s assets, liabilities and equity. (See “Assets = Liabilities + Equity” below.) To create this balance sheet, you can use a spreadsheet software like Excel, but you should </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/make-the-move-from-excel-to-accounting-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider using accounting software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for such important statements.</span></p>
<h2>Liabilities</h2>
<p>Meet Michael. Tom&#8217;s friend. Unlike Tom, Michael is a liability to the company. Being an inherently negative term, Michael is not thrilled with this description.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella of accounting, liabilities refer to a company’s debts or financially-measurable obligations. Liability is also classified as current or long-term.</p>
<p>Current liabilities are obligations that the company should settle one year or less. They consist, <span style="font-weight: 400;">predominantly</span>, of short-term debt repayments, payments to suppliers, and monthly operational costs (rent, electricity, <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/abcs-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accruals</a>) that are known in advance. And finally, current liabilities are typically paid with Current assets.</p>
<p>Long-term liabilities, on the other hand, include debt such as mortgages or loans used to purchase fixed assets. These are paid off over years instead of months.</p>
<p>Why is all this important?</p>
<p>Because a company’s working capital is the difference between its current assets and liabilities. And that&#8217;s important!</p>
<h2>Equity and the Owner’s Equity Formula</h2>
<p>Equity refers to the owner’s value in an asset or group of assets. Just like homeowners accumulate equity value as they pay off their mortgage, Owner&#8217;s Equity is defined as the proportion of the total value of a company&#8217;s assets that can be claimed by its owners (whether a sole proprietorship or a partnership). Equity is also referred to as net worth or capital and shareholders equity.</p>
<p>This equity becomes an asset as it is something that a homeowner can borrow against if need be. You can calculate it by deducting all liabilities from the total value of an asset: <strong>(Equity = Assets – Liabilities)</strong>.</p>
<p>In accounting, the company&#8217;s total equity value is the sum of owners equity—the value of the assets contributed by the owner(s)—and the total income that the company earns and retains.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider a company whose total assets are valued at $1,000. With a debt of $900 (liabilities). In this example, the owner’s value in the assets is $100, representing the company’s equity.</p>
<h2>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an understanding of each of these terms, let’s take another look at the </span><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-equation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting equation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The basic accounting equation is fundamental to the double-entry accounting system common in bookkeeping wherein every financial transaction has equal and opposite effects in at least two different accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This basic accounting equation “balances” the company’s balance sheet, showing that a company&#8217;s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity. This formula, also known as the balance sheet equation, shows that what a company owns (assets) is purchased by either what it owes (liabilities) or by what its owners invest (equity).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a company wants to manufacture a car part, they will need to purchase machine X that costs $1000. It borrows $400 from the bank and spends another $600 in order to purchase the machine. Its assets are now worth $1000, which is the sum of its liabilities ($400) and equity ($600).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to pay close attention to the balance between liabilities and equity. A company&#8217;s financial risk increases when liabilities fund assets. This is sometimes referred to as the company&#8217;s leverage.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Statement of Owner’s Equity</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Statement of Owner&#8217;s Equity (also known as a Statement of Changes in Owner&#8217;s Equity) provides an accounting of how a company’s capital has changed during a specified period due to contributions, withdrawals, net income, or net loss. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net income is equal to income minus expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owner contributions and income result in an increase in capital, whereas withdrawals and expenses cause capital to decrease. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Net Change Formula</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to calculate the change in the value of anything from its previous values—such as equity, revenue, or even a stock </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">price</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a given period of time—the Net Change Formula makes it simple. </span></p>
<p><strong>Net Change Formula = Current Period’s Value – Previous Period’s Value</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also calculate this change in percentage terms using this formula:</span></p>
<p><strong>Net Change (%) = [(Current Period’s Value – Previous Period’s Value) / Previous Period’s Value] X 100</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you heard that right. There are more than <i>three trillion dollars</i> in business capital held in suspended animation as negotiated net terms and outstanding invoices.</p>
<p>Nearly every U.S. business connects somehow to this enormous ocean of out-of-reach funds.   Let’s explore a bit how this economy came into being and what opportunities exist today for unlocking its value.</p>
<h2>A brief history of net terms</h2>
<p>For decades, B2B commerce has been, in many ways, an alternate universe compared to B2C. Unlike with typical consumer transactions (where customers might pay for groceries with a credit card, for example), the B2B world is one where sellers frequently wait weeks or months to get paid unless they act as a bank and step in to provide short-term credit to buyers.</p>
<p>B2B is a landscape where buyers seeking the necessary materials, inventory, and supplies to run their businesses are typically required to prove they are good credit candidates to each seller. Those buyers must then often abide by non-negotiable payment terms.</p>
<p>In this reality, both sellers and buyers often wind up cash-starved and growth-challenged, with funds hanging in an accounts receivable limbo.</p>
<p>Trade credit, otherwise known as “net terms,” has long driven this alternate universe. With net terms of 30, 60, 90 days or more, sellers front inventory to cash-strapped buyers, giving them a set amount of time to pay for the delivered goods.</p>
<p>Trade credit might sound like a win-win solution, but it’s complicated. Trade credit can become a circular, never-ending cash flow <i>problem</i> for both buyers and sellers. We refer to this particular B2B challenge as the Net Terms Economy.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/">PYMNTS</a>, the current Net Terms Economy exists mainly because of the cumbersome process of risk assessment for B2B businesses, coupled with the long waiting times to get paid.</p>
<p>If a new buyer requests net terms from a seller, it puts the onus on the seller to assess the credit risk before they offer net terms.  The risk assessment process for most sellers is highly manual and takes a fair amount of time to complete.</p>
<p>At the end of that assessment, the seller may deny offering terms to the buyer if the risk profile is too high. If the seller does offer terms, the terms might be too restrictive for the buyer to accept. Regardless, each business loses valuable time and opportunities when the trade credit financing process is slow, inefficient, or when the outcomes do not meet the needs of buyers. The status quo does not easily scale to meet the needs of today’s B2B e-commerce.</p>
<p>However, this is all about to change.</p>
<p>New technologies have emerged in the past decade to make it possible to provide credit decisions and on-demand access to business credit in near real-time. All of this enabled by the combined powers of data science, machine learning, and the ability to do business in the cloud. Its this technical confluence that will fuel the rapid acceleration of B2B payment and credit.</p>
<p><strong>Critical factors include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic risk assessment</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">On-demand access to business capital</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Better repayment terms</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Financing at the point of transaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s examine each of these critical factors needed to unlock the Net Terms Economy by way of faster intelligent B2B transactions.</p>
<h2>1. Dynamic risk assessment at scale</h2>
<p>For buyers to gain trade credit, traditionally a B2B seller must go through a lengthy and time-intensive process to understand the creditworthiness of a new buyer. To provide nearly real-time B2B payments, dynamic risk assessment—so that underwriting happens fast,  yet accurately—is a must.</p>
<p>With the power of machine learning in the background, B2B sellers can extend financing from inside the checkout process, providing a better user experience with payment and credit options, contextualized at the point of need.</p>
<h2>2. On-demand access to business capital</h2>
<p>A key to unlocking the Net Terms Economy requires accessible funds (faster payment) as soon as an order is captured, and the risk assessment process is complete. By paying B2B sellers right way, capital is “unlocked” that would otherwise have remained inaccessible until a buyer pays their invoice off.</p>
<p>Near real-time payments are eliminating the wait for modern B2B companies. Breakthroughs in machine learning technology that allow platforms to connect to cloud-based transactional data and analyze it in real-time, contributing to faster credit decisions, are driving the change.</p>
<h2>3. Better repayment terms</h2>
<p>The net terms of a new, real-time B2B payments solution must provide mutual benefits to both sellers and buyers they serve. Sellers need to get their money quickly, while buyers want the opportunity to capture flexible terms, which means they can make the necessary investments in their business to grow without disruptions to their cash flow.</p>
<p>With today’s platforms, a “net 60” payment option with no interest can be made available during the online checkout process. They may also be able to extend their terms week-by-week (for 52 weeks) for a flat fee, in most US states.</p>
<h2>4. Financing at the point of transaction</h2>
<p>A new B2B e-commerce payment ecosystem requires the ability for buyers to get credit at the time of need, within the context of where they are making the online transaction. If that’s not available, and approval for net terms and trade credit is difficult, more abandoned carts are inevitable.</p>
<p>The latest B2B payments solutions bring credit directly to the point of an e-commerce transaction, with plugins within the workflows of other platforms, marketplaces, portals, and applications.</p>
<h2>Payment platforms for the Net Terms Economy</h2>
<p>Times are changing for the Net Terms Economy. Many industries are taking advantage of technology to offer better, speedier B2B payments and credit.</p>
<p>E-commerce platforms are now integrating with the Fundbox business capital platform to offer their customers a simple, fast, and transparent way to transact.</p>
<p>New payment and credit solutions now allow sellers to be paid very quickly for a small interchange fee, while buyers can receive extremely fast trade-credit decisions. If approved, those buyers can use their credit with multiple vendors as well, with more generous payment terms. With tech-enabled solutions like this, B2B companies can offer payment ease for both buyers and sellers like never before.</p>
<p>However, while <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/trade-credit-dilemma-report/">The Trade Credit Dilemma Report</a> findings indicated strong enthusiasm for these platforms, fewer than 14 percent of surveyed businesses currently use them, and nearly 20 percent have never even heard of them. Specifically, 54 percent of surveyed SMBs generating below $10 million in annual revenue report being “very” or “extremely” interested in using immediate payment platforms. A whopping 73 percent of larger firms cite wanting to send “faster payments” as buyers. In addition, companies show almost equal interest in immediate payments as sellers and buyers.</p>
<p>Many survey respondents said that immediate payment platforms would not only ensure they’re paid promptly but also allow them to quickly purchase supplies (particularly helpful when there is no pre-existing trade credit relationship between the parties). Faster payments would then allow them to focus on their core missions and growth opportunities.</p>
<h2>Vast opportunities from faster payments</h2>
<p>The concept of net terms has been around for centuries, but the massive capital tied up in <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/unpaid-invoices/">outstanding invoices</a> is a bigger problem than it has ever been. Sellers have gotten used to either waiting weeks or months for payment or having to take on the risk of extending trade credit directly to buyers.</p>
<p>At the same time, buyers have become accustomed to being stuck with payment terms that don’t work for their cash flow cycles. It has never seemed like anything could change in the world of B2B payments.</p>
<p>Getting paid right away is very powerful for B2B businesses and the entire small business economy. Now, the opportunity for a new, better Net Terms Economy that provides quicker payments has arrived. Both sellers and buyers can benefit from more timely credit decisions and on-demand funds.</p>
<p>Thanks to the speed of today’s technology, supported by data and machine learning, there no longer needs to be an alternate B2B payments universe. Instead, today’s B2B companies of all sizes can grow to the best of their potential—right here in the real world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with intelligent risk assessment and on-demand access to payments and business credit, businesses on both sides of the equation are benefiting. The opportunity to create transformational change by unlocking the Net Terms Economy is now a reality.</p>

Fundbox can still help you access liquid capital through a business line of credit that can even allow you to draw upon your outstanding invoices.</p>
<p>We purposefully designed Fundbox Pay to help make business transactions between SMB2B buyers and sellers a dynamic, frictionless, and most important, a fast experience.</p>
<h3>How does Fundbox Pay work?</h3>
<p>There are a couple of key things to know about how Fundbox Pay works.</p>
<p>If you sell products or services using Fundbox Pay, you will get paid once a buyer confirms the payment, funds arrive as soon as the next business day , similar to how business-to-consumer (B2C) merchants get paid at the point of sale.</p>
<p>When you accept payment through Fundbox Pay, you no longer have to extend net terms or trade credit, and you won’t have to deal with chasing unpaid invoices in order to reconcile your accounts receivables. Instead, simply invite your customers to begin transacting with you on Fundbox Pay. Fundbox will take care of the rest by providing your approved customers with convenient, flexible financing and net terms.</p>
<p><strong>The upshot? You will no longer have to act like a bank, assuming all of the risk while getting none of the rewards.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a buyer approved for credit on Fundbox Pay, then you will have faster access to products or services with 60 days of interest-free financing right out of the gate. After those 60 days are up, you can select extended payment terms that work best for your business and your cash flow. Buyers paying with Fundbox Pay can extend terms up to a year with a flat weekly fee.</p>
<p>Our goal with this new product is simple: to make all your SMB2B business transactions as simple and as fast as purchasing a cup of coffee.</p>
<h3>Background: How Fundbox Pay solves the small business cash crunch</h3>
<p>Often the greatest challenge of running a small business is keeping cash flowing in order to operate or grow their businesses over time. The situation for smaller businesses is very difficult, with a lack of cash flow killing more than <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/small-business/mismanaging-cash-flow-can-kill-small-business/">50%</a> of small businesses annually.</p>
<p>If you’re an SMB2B, you probably know that getting a reliable stream of cash flowing into your business in a timely manner is an elusive goal. One big reason for this is that your own customers are <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/unpaid-invoices/">not paying their invoices on time</a> which has a direct impact on your ability to keep the lights on, let alone grow and expand.</p>
<p>The late paying of invoices and their impact on cash flow has forced many SMB2B’s to seek out credit from commercial lenders and banks to compensate for the slow flow of cash, therein lies the rub. The reality is that commercial lenders have made access to credit incredibly challenging for SMB2B owners by requiring good to great FICO scores and loan thresholds that are higher than what most small businesses need or want. Both of these issues create major stumbling blocks for most SMB2Bs, which is part of the reason why bank approval rates for small businesses are a lowly <a href="https://www.biz2credit.com/small-business-lending-index">24%</a>.</p>
<p>All this is why Fundbox Pay is such an exciting solution for SMB2B owners. We designed it to remove payment friction while democratizing access to credit.</p>
<p>Fundbox Pay brings the B2C commerce experience to the SMB2B market to make transactions between small businesses as simple as buying a cup of coffee. And we think that’s pretty neat.</p>

<p>As a small business owner, your time is precious. To help you to cut through the informational haze when looking for SMB working capital, we’ve put together this overview about three popular financial product options: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_cash_advance">Merchant Cash Advances</a></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration">SBA Loans</a></span> and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit">Business Lines of Credit</a></span>.</p>
<p>Small business owners often turn to one or more of these options to secure financing for growing businesses&#8211;maybe one will be right for you.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fc7d972f-b288-4a00-acf2-01c76d22ef67_shutterstock_557159944.jpg" alt="Small Business Financing Options" width="600" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding Merchant Cash Advances</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is a Merchant Cash Advance?</span></h3>
<p>A merchant cash advance (MCA) is a lump-sum amount of funds provided by a lender to a business in exchange for an agreed-upon percentage of future credit card or debit card sales.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">How does an MCA work?</span></h3>
<p>MCAs are primarily designed for businesses whose revenue comes primarily from credit and debit card sales, such as restaurants, ecommerce or retail shops. Now, merchant cash advances are also available to other businesses that don’t rely heavily on credit card or debit card sales. An MCA provider will give you a sum of cash up front, in exchange for a percentage of your future sales.</p>
<p>MCA repayments can be structured in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first type of MCA, you can get an upfront sum of cash in exchange for a percentage of your future credit and debit card sales.</li>
<li>In the second common scenario, you can get a lump sum of cash that you then pay back in fixed daily or weekly debits from your bank account. These are known as Automated Clearing House (ACH) withdrawals.</li>
<li>This second option has become the most common type of MCAs and, they’re referred to as ACH merchant cash advances and allow providers to market to businesses that aren’t primarily tied to credit and debit card sales.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why MCAs might work for you</span>:</h3>
<p>Having a lower credit score is ok. Also, the application process is relatively easy and, once approved, there is quick access to working capital.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things to think about when considering an MCA</span>:</h3>
<p>MCA loans come with a high <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp">APR</a></span> and rigorous pay back requirements that could make a serious dent in your cash flow. And, once you’ve picked a merchant service provider you may have difficulty switching, should you want to do so in the future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/8e12a17a-59f0-4dbf-a29a-cbc2c108f36e_shutterstock_731283796.jpg" alt="Small Business Financing Options" width="600" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">SBA Loans</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is an SBA Loan?</span></h3>
<p>A<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/"> Small Business Administration</a></span> (SBA) loan is a long-term, low-interest small business loan partially guaranteed by the government.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">How does an SBA Loan work?</span></h3>
<p>SBA loans are small-business loans guaranteed by the SBA and issued by participating lenders which are mostly banks. In order to qualify, a small business owner must be at least 2+  years in business and have a personal credit score of 620+ and, an annual revenue run rate of $100,000+ or more.</p>
<p>The SBA can guarantee up to 85% of loans of $150,000 or less and 75% of loans of more than $150,000. The agency says its average loan amount was about $375,000 in 2016. The program’s maximum loan amount is $5 million.</p>
<p>If you happen to be looking to open a new office, hire more employees or refinance an existing loan, SBA loans are a great option. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/sba-loan-rates/">SBA loan rates and terms </a></span>typically are more manageable for borrowers than other types of financing.</p>
<p>In keeping with SBA rules, participating lenders set their interest rates based on the prime rate plus a markup rate known as the spread.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your loan is more than $50,000 and the term is shorter than seven years, your rate depends on the prime rate, with a maximum spread of 2.25 percentage points. As of December 2017, that meant a maximum interest rate of 6.75%.</li>
<li>If your loan is more than $50,000 and the term is seven years or more, the maximum spread is 2.75 percentage points. As of December 2017, the maximum interest rate was 7.25%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the APR on a loan differs from the interest rate. The APR is a percentage that includes all loan fees in addition to the interest rate.</p>
<p>In contrast, major online small-business lenders that don’t do SBA loans offer financing with APRs that can be as high as the triple digits.</p>
<p>In addition to the low APRs, another benefit of SBA loans is that you get more time to repay them than you would get on non-SBA forms of lending from banks or online lenders.</p>
<p>The loan term depends on how you plan to use the money. According to the SBA, you can use the funds for working capital or daily operations (term 7 years); new equipment purchases (term 10 years); real estate purchases (term up to 25 years).</p>
<p>For SBA loans, a longer term means a lower interest rate and lower regular payments. That means you’ll have more money available for other business needs.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why SBA loans might work for you</span>:</h3>
<p>For new small business owners, SBA loans offer one of the most accesibles path for securing working capital. In addition, SBA loans can restructure debt at better terms for businesses with cash flow issues by providing longer loan maturities and requiring lower monthly payments. SBA loans are also typically structured without balloon payments and longer payment terms means less cash flow pressure.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things to think about when considering SBA loans</span>:</h3>
<p>Like MCAs, SBA loans have higher interest rates than traditional banks and, applying for an SBA loan will take a fair amount of time to fill out all the paperwork. Also, unlike traditional banks that can process loan applications fairly fast, the turn around on SBA loans can take a bit longer. Finally, SBA loans require a personal guarantee from the business owner and in many cases, the SBA will secure a loan using the business owners property.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding Business Lines Of Credit </span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is a Business Line of Credit?</span></h3>
<p>A business line of credit (BLC) allows you to keep reusing (drawing down) and repaying funds as often as you’d like, as long as you make payments on time and you don’t exceed your credit limit. Most lenders allow you to repay your balance in full early to save on interest costs. The typical range for a business line of credit runs from $5,000 to $150,000.</p>
<p>BLC’s with lower credit limits are typically unsecured, which means you do not need to provide collateral such as real estate or inventory.</p>
<p>BLC’s provide flexibility that a regular business loan doesn&#8217;t. With a business line of credit, you can borrow up to a certain limit — say, $100,000 — and pay interest only on the portion of money that you borrow.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">How does a Business Line of Credit work</span>?</h3>
<p>Most traditional lenders, such as banks, require businesses to have strong revenue and at least a few years of history to qualify for a line of credit. Larger lines of credit may be secured, meaning they require collateral in the form of property or other assets. If you do not keep up with your payments, your lender can seize that collateral.</p>
<p>To apply, lenders typically require the following documentation: personal and business tax returns, bank account information and business financial statements, such as profit-and-loss statements and a balance sheet.</p>
<p>Online business lenders typically have looser qualifications than banks. However, these lenders are also likely to charge higher rates than banks and may have lower credit limits.</p>
<p>At a minimum, you’ll need at least six months in business and $25,000 in annual revenue to qualify for a business line of credit. Although some lenders don’t set a minimum credit score, borrowers most likely will need a score of 500 or higher to qualify.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why a Business Line of Credit might work for you</span>:</h3>
<p>Once you are approved for a BLC, you won’t owe any interest until you draw on your credit. (Your lender might charge a set-up fee, so be on the lookout for those. Your lender may also charge an annual fee to keep credit available until you decide to use it.) BLC’s offer small business owners a good amount of flexibility and control (when and how much to apply for). It can also be easier to qualify and get approved for business lines of credit, as opposed other types of small business loans.</p>
<p>All these benefits make business lines of credit an option you should definitely consider. And for those who might be interested in a exploring a BLC, Fundbox <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/">Direct Draw</a></span> could be an excellent solution for your business needs.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things to think about</span>:</h3>
<p>As with any other financial products, a BLC is debt, until you use it to create new revenue. For those small businesses that may be struggling, a BLC can quickly turn into a liability if not managed correctly.</p>
<hr />
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wrapping It All Up</span></h3>
<p>When it comes to financing your working capital needs for your small business, you have a ton of options. Merchant cash advances, SBA loans, and business lines of credit are just a few of the many tools out there, and it’s a good idea to have multiple tools in your financial toolbox.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best option is to use more than one, depending on your immediate needs and longer term business goals, and reevaluate your situation regularly to make sure you’re getting the best deal, the best terms possible, and the most value out of your investment in your business.</p>

<h2>Highlights from our conversation</h2>
<p><strong>Fundbox: Megan, what are some of the biggest challenges you face when servicing small-business customers?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Megan Christensen:</strong><br />
Our “why,” or the reason we do what we do, is to help small businesses succeed, while helping small business owners avoid some of the pitfalls many fall into.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Most, if not all, issues that small businesses face involve financing. Many small business owners are not even aware of self-created issues that can harm their business until it’s too late.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The top issue that we see most small-business owners create is starting their business using their own personal financing. This can affect their ability to secure business-line credit in the future. Often, small business owners don’t realize that their personal credit and business credit are linked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A second issue I see is this: When small business owners go “credit shopping,” and they inadvertently select a solution that might not be the best fit for what they’re looking to do. Many have opted for using their personal credit cards to support their business, not because it’s the best choice, but because it’s familiar and accessible at the time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In either case, our biggest challenge is helping our customers to become better educated consumers as it relates to financing. Believe it or not, many of our customers were unaware of what a business credit score is until they tried to get a line of credit and were denied.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/srU7CTe.jpg" alt="Small business challenges" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Ray, what are some of the biggest challenges you see with your small-business customers?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Ray Mejia:</strong><br />
The biggest issue we face is that we see many applicants who take out a series of very expensive loans over short periods of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In most cases like these, the small business owner finds out the hard way that the terms for these loans are very inflexible and not cash-flow friendly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The originators of these sorts of short-term loans don’t have a traditional underwriting process. Instead, they analyze the ability of the small business to pay the loan back quickly. Terms then focus on fast repayment, with little to no consideration on the potential business impact to cash flow.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In a case like this, the business owner might take one loan to meet an urgent business need and then another loan to fill in the cash-flow gaps while repaying the first loan. Suddenly, you have a domino effect where a small business owner has several loans, using each new loan to pay off the previous loan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This nightmare scenario is, unfortunately, commonplace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another common issue we see is the need for massive education and thought leadership. Our customers need to know what lending options are available to them, and which options are the best fit for their business.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many small business owners don’t do enough due diligence when looking to secure a line of credit. Later, they end up regretting their decision after they&#8217;ve committed to a loan.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We don’t want our customers to take a loan just because it provides fast access to credit. Instead, we want to make sure that our customers think through their credit needs and make an informed choice from a business perspective.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/MOME35S.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Megan, what is your process for helping small business owners with their financing?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MC:</strong> We see a good number of customers who don&#8217;t know what they want or they know exactly what they want. In either case, we have a process to help them reach their goals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We always look at our clients from <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-cs-of-credit/">a lender’s point of view</a>: Do they have all the right components lined up to qualify for a line of credit?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Next, we create a &#8220;financial roadmap&#8221; that reflects where the business is today and where they would like to be in the future. This roadmap becomes the execution plan to which we hold our clients accountable. We make sure that they have clear goals set in advance. Our expertise is helping our clients put a plan in place that leads to a positive outcome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/cqLETBZ.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Why is creating this financial roadmap so helpful?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MC:</strong> Giving them support and education, while providing extra accountability, sets them up for success.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Many of the small-business owners that become our clients start off trying to do everything on their own. They might be experts in their area of business focus, but lack financial foresight or expertise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, by the time they reach out to us, they’ve learned the hard way that trying to do financial planning on their own comes with unanticipated challenges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, many business owners use their personal credit when first starting off, instead of applying for and using business credit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It&#8217;s understandable. It’s easy and familiar. The problem is that when they want to transition from using their personal to business credit, harmed their business credit score. If this is the case, they get shut out from using business credit until their business credit score gets better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is why we use business credit education as a means to prevent small-business owners from making mistakes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/5Pbuxtl.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Ray, what does your process look like with your small business clients?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>RM:</strong> We customize everything we do to the specific needs of each client. We take a business-consultative approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What I mean by this is that we take a holistic view of our client’s business fundamentals. We look at business models, revenue drivers, operating costs, and business objectives. Then we develop a customer plan designed to help that customer reach their goals.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our team has deep expertise in business assessment that allows us to align the right credit solutions for the right reasons. And to date, our approach has proven to be successful.</p>
<p><strong>Megan, what’s different about your service vs. other brokers?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MC:</strong> I would say that experience is, by far, one of our biggest differentiators. Credit Suite is the largest broker serving small businesses. We have a long history of producing amazing results for our customers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We’ve been able to translate our experience into proven processes and procedures designed to deliver successful funding outcomes. We have examined and tested every aspect of our service. And the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Another differentiator is that we believe in educating our customers and teaching them good “credit governance” habits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This means not only understanding what a good business credit score looks like, but how to build one over time, and how to use tools like a credit report to track your creditworthiness or to select the best credit-solution providers like Fundbox, which has been an enormous asset to Credit Suite. Our clients have found that, by far, Fundbox has the simplest application process on the market today.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, when you add up our experience, our belief in an educated consumer, and our knowledge of the best tools or credit providers like Fundbox, we would like to think that in aggregate, all of these things help to differentiate Credit Suite from other brokers.</p>
<p><strong>Ray, what would you say are your key differentiators?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>RM:</strong> We’ve developed a proprietary solution that generates identifiers and specific product or service recommendations best suited to help our clients achieve their goals. By automating our own evaluation processes, we can provide advice faster and with greater assuredness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The other difference is our financial experience as a team.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, I have over 15 years of financial management experience. I can triangulate between the needs of our business clients and the various financial solutions, consultants, or other important resources available to them. As we all know, time is a currency. Our deep knowledge and experience enables us to provide value quickly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/JsLZvVT.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>Are there any important tips you could offer small-business owners when looking for a broker?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MC:</strong> Running a small business, as we all know, is not easy! When you’re an owner, you believe that you have to be an expert in everything from business strategy to marketing to operations and, of course, finance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The reality is, you can’t be an expert in everything. Knowing that, small business owners should pick partners to help them make better decisions faster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are massive opportunity costs associated with starting and growing a business, and finance is one area where costs can add up. So, don’t go it alone!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Instead, partner with an experienced financing provider or consultant who can offer you trusted advice while minimizing your opportunity costs, especially as they relate to funding and credit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The second tip I would give is, don’t neglect your business credit report. For all small-business owners, it’s not if you need business credit, but when you need to be monitoring your business credit. Be cautious about funding your business with your personal finances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>RM:</strong> This might sound counterintuitive considering the business we’re in, but when small business owners are starting to think about funding, they should set up a meeting with their local banker. Your local banker can provide meaningful insights and helpful guidance for free.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One piece of valuable advice they can provide, is how to prepare for applying for a business line of credit. If you apply for business credit without having your bases covered, then you may end up in a process that may not deliver what you need.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The second tip I would give is for small-business owners to get into the habit of using business credit cards when they need smaller amounts of credit. If you use a business credit card and you pay your bills on a timely basis, then this will help to build up your business credit score.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i.imgur.com/g9MWAFZ.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><strong>What does the future hold for broker-initiated lending?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>MC:</strong> More and more business owners are now understanding the value of their business credit report and how often business lenders check them. In the future, I hope to see small business owners using their business credit before even thinking about using their personal credit to start their companies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>RM:</strong> With more Fintech companies emerging, the broker industry will have a broader range of tools and services available. Those new tools will enable a team like ours to deliver greater value.</p>

<p>All your hard work can come to a halt when one unexpected event happens. That’s why you would never go a moment without ensuring you have adequate business insurance whether it’s general liability insurance, property insurance, commercial insurance, worker compensation insurance or natural disaster insurances (fire, earthquakes, etc.).</p>
<p style="padding-top: 15px;">According to a recent Forbes article, “75 percent of small businesses don’t have a disaster plan in place&#8230;52 percent of owners say it would take at least months to recover”. If you can&#8217;t afford those months to recover from a potential disaster, you may agree that putting a safety net in place is crucial and important for your business survival.</p>
<h2>Are you Prepared For Unexpected Shortage In Working Capital?</h2>
<p>Similarly, something that many business owners don’t think of is unexpected cash shortage that can occur due to seasonality, unexpected late or missed client payments, large influx of orders which cause cash flow issues, unexpected employee theft which require time consuming litigation, etc. All these factors can cause a disruption in your working capital &amp; cash on hand.</p>
<p>As a result, you may not have enough working capital to cover payroll, cost of goods for new client orders, funds for new time sensitive equipment deals, or additional marketing that may help boost your business during peak seasons. One missed deal from a large client order, or the inability to make payroll could result in missed income or expensive lawsuits which could overall have a serious impact on business.</p>
<p>As an astute business owner, you&#8217;re already strategically planning ahead. The more risks you remove from your day to day operations, the higher the chance your business will survive and not become another statistic. Having a disaster plan in place is a vital part of that planning.</p>
<h2>A Business Line of Credit as a Safety Net</h2>
<p>Opening  a line of credit so you have access to emergency funding when you need it is a huge step toward de-risking your business activities. A line of credit allows you to access extra working capital in case of an emergency.</p>
<div style="background: #2C3E50; border: 1px solid #fff; color: #fff; padding: 15px;"><b>Did you know?</b> Over 70,000 U.S. business owners use Fundbox Business Line Of Credit.<br />

<h3 style="padding-top: 15px;">What kind of negative situations can extra working capital prevent?</h3>
<table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Costly lawsuits from missed employee payroll</td>

<tr>
<td>Loss of income from missing large client orders</td>

<tr>
<td>Missing out on great equipment &amp; transportation deals that could further your business</td>

<td>Missing out on bargain advertising opportunity during high customer demand or peak season</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Think of it almost like free insurance against worse case scenarios that could be detrimental to your business.</p>
<p>Why haven’t you pursued a business line of credit as a safety net?</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it right now, or perhaps there’s a lot of time involved in applying for one. Or you may be concerned that you won’t be approved.</p>
<p>We understand your top concerns based on our survey with business owners. We understand what’s stopping you from opening up a business line of credit with a bank. The time consuming visits to the bank, the paperwork, multiple documents, the credit pull, and maybe you might even be unsure if your credit score is good enough to qualify.</p>
<p>According to a recent interview by Amy Feldman of Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2017/09/26/fundboxs-big-opportunity-in-changing-the-way-small-businesses-get-paid/#24f7cff15204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox is one of the companies that has been changing the way businesses get access to emergency financing</a>.

<h3>When Is The Right Time To Secure A Business Line Of Credit?</h3>
<p>Whether you have considered a business line of credit as a safety net or not, you want to act now when you don&#8217;t need the extra cash, so that it is available for you when times get rough. It’s best to apply when times are good, income is high, clients are plentiful, so that you can prepare for a time when you are struggling.</p>

There is no credit check to get started. And if you are approved, you do not pay anything unless you use your credit to draw funds. You have no obligation to use the capital right away. You can just keep it available as a safety net for your business, or as a <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/double-business-growth-in-2018/">tool to help you grow in the year ahead</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As any small business owner will tell you, it’s hard to start one.  Between having to be an expert at literally everything, to the challenges of getting customers to pay their bills on time (check out the small business </span><strong><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/unpaid-invoices/">unpaid invoice economy</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">), unless this work is truly your life calling,&#8230; then forget it.   But don’t just take our word for it, here are a few amazing Austin small business owners discussing </span><strong>what they wish they knew</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they first started out.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why Fundbox is teaming up with </span><strong><a href="https://austin.score.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCORE Austin</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pilot a new small business accelerator to be held in Austin on November 9.  The accelerator brings together some amazing subject experts including the internationally recognized small business marketing expert </span><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roncates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Cates</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who will offer effective strategies for growing your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator will have two sessions, one in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/score-austin-and-fundbox-small-business-accelerator-morning-session-tickets-38781970919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">morning</a> </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and one in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/score-austin-and-fundbox-small-business-accelerator-afternoon-session-tickets-39047091903" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">afternoon.</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All of the proceeds from this event will be donated to SCORE Austin.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So please join us and feel free to bring a friend.  We hope to see you there!  #Austin #Smallbizlove</span></p>
