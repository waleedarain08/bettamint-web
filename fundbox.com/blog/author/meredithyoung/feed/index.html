As a small business owner, you may have your doors temporarily closed. However, this is a perfect time to reflect, regroup, and reload for when business is back and you’re open again. Here are some tips and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-business-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you use these slower times to improve your business for when you reopen.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize Your Business Finances</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though you may not be in your regular office in the back of your shop, or sitting next to your manager who helps you run daily operations, this is a great time to organize your business&#8217;s finances from home. You can also use this time to apply for a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of December 27, 2020, Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP. Now <strong><a href="https://fundbox.com/paycheck-protection-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox can help connect you</a></strong> with a PPP lender. </span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many brick and mortar </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-banks-reassess-branch-strategy-amid-coronavirus-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banks are closing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for safety reasons and are making it difficult to access your accounts and organize your finances. Take advantage of this bit of downtime to explore alternative options in case anything like this occurs again. An </span><a href="https://www.northone.com/our-customers/small-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easy to use a digital bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is great to keep your business moving forward with no interruptions. Whether you set limits on your business cards from your phone, or pay employees and collect invoices through the app, digital banking could help keep your finances simple.</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from transitioning to a reliable digital bank, take the additional time to organize your business taxes. If you haven’t started the process yet, lucky you. Not only is </span><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks offering three months free</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help businesses in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, but the U.S tax deadline has extended to July 15th, again to help small businesses and those affected by the pandemic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refresh Your Public Profiles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While new reviews may not be rolling in on your company’s </span><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yelp for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google My Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pages, take this downtime to update your online identity to your exact specifications. While your website may sound like the obvious place to keep your customers updated, Yelp and your Google listing are customer facing and a great place to positively represent your brand while interacting with customers, since they’re made up of reviews from people who’ve interacted and experienced your brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on top of your business’ Yelp page during this time gives you the opportunity to read through past reviews both positive and negative. This can help you forge a bond with your customers and develop that trust. </span><a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/yelp-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guides like this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help any business owner to navigate the best ways to utilize Yelp. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with your Yelp Business page, your Google My Business is another great spot for prospective customers looking into your business. Make sure all of your information is up to date, from your hours to your website address. Even uploading new pictures can give your business a clean and professional first impression when people are actively searching.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double Down on Social Media</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might wonder why doubling down on your business’ social media would be relevant, but think about what people are doing while “social distancing”. Many are at home most of the day, not leaving, and consuming content via their television/streaming service, and scrolling through their social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doubling down on your social channels means connecting and keeping your followers in the know about what’s going on. This is a great time to run </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1738164643098669?id=445653312788501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing for Facebook ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, run promotional giveaways on Instagram, etc. Not only is it a good time to experiment, but while people are seeking interaction, it&#8217;s an opportunity for you to engage with them and stay at the forefront of their mind. While you are testing new methods and campaigns, remember the gravity of the situation. Be sure you are being sensitive to any #StayAtHome movements by not calling people to “Come hold hands and wait in line starting at 6am”. It sounds silly, but double and triple check your copy before posting, especially now!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore Alternative Options</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decrease in foot traffic may slow down your business and affect just about every industry. This can force more and more suppliers to improve their customer service, which may give you leverage to negotiate better deals or even </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/welcome-new-net-terms-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only should you discuss your payment options for the near future, but also look at other outlets for services you currently outsource that your business relies on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest challenges COVID-19 can cause for businesses of any size is how and when they get paid. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">#paytoday campaign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urges governments and other enterprises to fulfill payments to small businesses right away, instead of waiting the typical 28 days until their net terms are due. Not only could this help support employees immediately (even before </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid19-cares-act-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are applied for and dispersed), but it’s estimated that if all small business vendors were to be paid right away, it would amount to an infusion of nearly a trillion dollars into small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While COVID-19 continues to impact the day-to-day operations of businesses across the country and around the world, there are many </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-business-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief programs and other resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help and steps you can take to improve. The fallout of COVID-19 may also affect your staff, taking extra time to focus on </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/management-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing your own employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and taking care of them as best as you can. From organizing your finances and curating your online presence to negotiating fair payment terms, these few tips could help your business not only fare this storm, but face an even better future.</span></p>
