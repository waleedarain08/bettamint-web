In fact, a 2017 report from <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/US+B2B+eCommerce+Will+Hit+12+Trillion+By+2021/-/E-RES136173">Forrester Research</a> estimated business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce transactions will reach $1.2 trillion by 2021.</p>
<p>But as the industry booms, the pace of business is also picking up speed, so B2B organizations tackling e-commerce need to figure out how to keep up. After all, competition across industries is getting more fierce, particularly in tight-margin retail sectors, while small business success is more challenging than ever. Customers are also becoming more demanding, accustomed to the seamless path-to-purchase journeys they enjoy on the B2C side (think Uber and Seamless.com). In addition, as millennials move into B2B management positions, they expect technology on their terms.</p>
<p>Finally, transactions are global and 24/7, so those businesses that don’t move faster will be left behind. The faster a business can complete a transaction, the faster it can move on to the next opportunity.</p>
<h2>Complex B2B payments slowed by the paper chase</h2>
<p>The problem is, B2B e-commerce is far more complex than B2C transactions. Unlike clicking “buy” on Amazon, for example, purchasing or selling B2B goods and services often involves multiple decision-makers, high-value deals, and a highly-targeted customer base.</p>
<p>Historically, complicated B2B payment methods also slow things to a crawl. In B2B transactions, customers usually don’t pay upfront but wait until they have received goods and services. Contracts may include prepayments or partial payments in order to receive discounts or gain increased flexibility. Invoices, of course, also have to make their way through various stages of approval. In addition, complex fees and taxes are part and parcel of cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Traditional types of business payments used can also slow things down with delays and asynchronous transactions, resulting in cash flow issues, delayed deals and slowed growth. <a href="https://www.afponline.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/pub/highlights_2016electronicpayments-final.pdf">According to AFP</a>, 51% of Business-to-business (B2B) payments in the US are made by checks, with the other 49% spread across Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), prepaid debit cards, Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit and debit transfers.</p>
<p>For example, after analyzing proprietary data, including an analysis of 16,000 customers from July through December 2018, <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/introducing-fundbox-checkout-b2b-ecommerce/">Fundbox found</a> that the average small- to medium-sized company has 24 percent of its monthly revenue tied up in accounts receivable, terms, or trade credit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/digital-credit-smbs-fundbox/">PYMNTS recently reported</a> on just one example of what businesses both small and large deal with all the time in the world of B2B: Three Babes Bakeshop, a local San Francisco business, had provided weekly pie orders to Munchery, an on-demand delivery service. The bakery is still owed $20,000, but Munchery has shut down and still owes many suppliers. Receivables are only considered an asset when Three Babes gets the cash, but without it, the bakery can’t get access to working capital it needs to grow. This kind of credit risk can be devastating to a small business.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for the B2B buyer, extended payment terms from suppliers can be essential in order to get the inventory it needs to succeed. Unfortunately, the bottom line in B2B has typically been that both parties, both buyer and seller, don’t necessarily get what they need when they need it, in the ways they want it. But the B2B payment paradigm is now shifting—big time.</p>
<h2>Changing payments to move faster</h2>
<p>Freedom, flexibility, at a faster speed: That is the key to lasting financial success in B2B e-commerce payments. Offering businesses credit, in context, at the point of sale, is an essential part of this fundamental shift.</p>
<p>If both parties—the buyer and seller—can reduce friction during the payment process, both sides can win and thrive. For small businesses, including those that sell on B2B online marketplaces, using the latest digital technology to offer and receive credit at the point of sale, inside the checkout flow, is a game-changer. It means sellers can get paid right away, rather than letting months go by. At the same time, buyers can get the product they need to keep up with orders and trends.</p>
<p>The result? Buyers can purchase more on the spot, sellers can sell more without waiting for money, and the entire industry has the opportunity to grow like never before. For small businesses, B2B e-commerce can become a growth opportunity, rather than a hindrance requiring complicated paperwork and a deep understanding of complex financial solutions.</p>
<p>B2B e-commerce has long had a need for speed. Now, thanks to the latest digital solutions, both B2B buyers and sellers—especially in the small business space—can move as fast as they need, to succeed on their own terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_1323093269-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_1323093269-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_1323093269.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>B2B e-commerce is bigger than ever: The landscape leapt to $1 trillion in U.S. sales for the first time in 2018, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/12/17/the-1-trillion-b2b-e-commerce-market-arrives-early/">according to Forrester Research</a></span>, accounting for 13 percent of all U.S.-focused B2B sales. And it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. By 2023, in fact, studies predict employee-generated e-commerce transactions will be close to $2 trillion. A strong economy, low unemployment and a shift in B2B purchasing to e-commerce from traditional forms of buying are all contributing to the boom.</p>
<p>For retailers and suppliers in the gifts and housewares space, though, tackling B2B e-commerce is just one of a host of daunting industry challenges. Global retail is transforming to meet consumer demands for seamless customer experiences, no matter whether they buy products online, in-the-store or on-the-go. There is ever-growing fierce competition from behemoth retailers such as Amazon and Wal-Mart. Possible changes in tariffs are keeping businesses on their toes.</p>
<p>Trends are shifting faster than ever—including sustainability, private labels, and personalization—which means gift and housewares companies must be flexible and agile enough to keep up.</p>
<h2>B2B e-commerce picks up speed, but payments can hold business back</h2>
<p>As B2B e-commerce picks up speed, however, gifts and housewares companies must figure out how to deal with both the opportunities and the obstacles of this growing, global market. Buyers and sellers of all sizes, from small businesses to larger brands, have to contend with complicated transactions, price negotiations, delivery discussions, and multiple decision-makers.</p>
<p>Traditional B2B commerce has long been constrained by the delays and asynchronous transactions caused by paper checks, invoices and inefficient risk profiling based on traditional credit models, while cross-border payments add even more bureaucratic layers of fees and taxes.</p>
<p>For both sides of the gift and housewares industry, it’s easy to see how these payment challenges can hobble businesses looking to grow. Buyers typically want or need extended time to pay to scale growth, but they also want goods and services delivered promptly to meet seasonal needs.</p>
<p>However, delayed payments mean that B2B gift and housewares sellers may become financially stressed, unable to properly invest in new inventory or prepare for the latest design and style trends. This is no minor issue: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/late-payments">Late invoice payments</a></span> affect over half of small businesses, according to Fundbox customer data.</p>
<h2>The new win-win equation in B2B e-commerce payments</h2>
<p>What if both buyers and sellers could get what works for them in a B2B e-commerce transaction, including in today’s popular B2B e-commerce marketplaces?</p>
<p>The right business credit solution can solve the B2B e-commerce payment conundrum so that everybody wins. That is, qualified buyers receive access to credit within minutes to finance B2B payments at the point of transaction—that is, at checkout. Payments go to merchants right away, while buyers can apply for Net 60 terms or, in some cases, pay a flat fee to get even more extended terms.</p>
<p>This is a brand-new way of addressing B2B e-commerce payments is a particularly important development in an industry such as gifts and housewares, which is filled with small firms providing specialized offerings.</p>
<p>For example, take an online wholesale B2B marketplace such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fitzroy Toys</span>, that connects small toy brands with retailers. The average toy store using the marketplace deals with hundreds of vendors for everything from trains and dolls to puzzles and plush, in order to fill their shelves and tempt customers. Traditionally, handling payment terms for so many suppliers would be mind-bogglingly complex, with a vast paper chase of PDFs or faxes to set up payment terms for each one.</p>
<p>With a technology-driven business credit solution, these toy retailers can stock the products they love without sacrificing their ability to spread out their payments. Toy brands can get their products into stores using their own wholesale policies, while accounts receive payment deposits into their account as soon as the next business day after receiving a confirmation.</p>
<h2>The gift of credit</h2>
<p>The credit crunch is due to disappear for hundreds of thousands of gift and housewares buyers and sellers across the U.S., thanks to a new era of B2B e-commerce payment platforms.</p>
<p>For brands, suppliers, and retailers, these better digital credit offerings are a B2B e-commerce game-changer. It will help unlock the potential of small businesses who cannot take on big credit risks.</p>
<p>Now, both buyers and sellers can enjoy the freedom to bloom, grow and thrive, and do what they do best: Meet the needs of their customers with the best products and services possible.</p>
