Running a successful small business without a budget is virtually impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without easy access to your financial information, many decisions are tougher than they should be. For example: How could you make an informed decision about whether it’s a good time to grow your business, purchase new inventory or assets, or give yourself a raise?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear, up-to-date budgets can help with questions like these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A budget is a tool that allows you to measure your ideal financial numbers against your actual figures. Effective budgeting requires regular calibration of the real business environment against the theoretical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds daunting or time-consuming, fear not. There are online resources that simplify the process. In fact, there are several downloadable, customizable business budget templates that you can access right now. And just to keep them within your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (see what we did there?) they’re free!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re going to walk you through seven of our current favorite small business budget template tools, but first let’s look at what you need to know about actually creating a business budget.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do I create a business budget?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a business budget is an extremely important step towards making sure your business not only stays on track financially, but is using the funds you have available in the most strategic ways possible. Whether you’re a startup or a more established business, adding a business budget to your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to stay organized and to plan how you can best use your budget to your advantage. If you are running a startup, you’ll want to budget for both your ongoing costs and the costs you will need accrue to actually get your business off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you create your business budget will depend a lot on what type of budgeting method you pursue. Once you’ve chosen your preferred method, you can use one of the template tools we’re going to discuss to help you actually create your budget. </span></p>
<p><b>Master budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have a master budget, your budget will involve taking the information from other smaller budgets within your business (think marketing versus labor) and compiling them into one main budget. This type of budget is a good fit for bigger companies with multiple departments who each have their own budgets. A master budget provides a more thorough look at your expenses. </span></p>
<p><b>Operating budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This type of business budget is very popular and estimates revenues and expenditures during a select period of time. This allows businesses to compare their actual results to their operating budget.</span></p>
<p><b>Financial budget. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create a financial budget, you’ll look past just your revenue and expenditure and include any assets, liabilities, and stockholder equity in your budget. You’ll use a balance sheet to present this information and to gain a clear vision of your business&#8217;s overall health. This type of budget is often used when a business is pursuing funding, an initial public offering, or a merger.</span></p>
<p><b>Cash budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This type of budget estimates how much money will pass through a business during a certain period of time (such as a quarter). A cash budget provides insight into how an organization can meet their immediate financial obligations or if they’ll need the help of financing, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as a line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to pay for any upcoming expenses.</span></p>
<p><b>Labor budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have employees, you may want to consider creating a labor budget that can help determine how many workers you will need to hire to achieve your desired level of production and how much it will cost to do this. </span></p>
<p><b>Capital budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A capital budget helps businesses plan for purchases of large assets. For example, buying a new warehouse or expensive machinery. A capital budget will account for the cost of the asset you plan to purchase and will look at the expected payback period and what the potential return on investment will be.</span></p>
<p><b>Strategic plan budget. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">By incorporating financial information, a strategic plan budget can help create a practical road map for how your business plans to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have long term goals, this budget can help you achieve them in a realistic—and frankly financially—possible way. </span></p>
<p><b>Static budget. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business sales and expenses are fairly consistent, then a static budget may be all you need to keep things on track financially. You won’t alter this budget throughout the year and it can be a great way to identify variations between your budgeted and actual line items. A static budget can also prove useful when evaluating sales performance.</span></p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://blog.capterra.com/free-small-business-budget-template/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capterra</a></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The download available from Capterra includes both a monthly and annual breakdown that can be used on an Excel spreadsheet. “Imagine going into a month having no idea what you were going to spend or how much money you were going to make,” the site says. “If you’re interested in having money in your bank account at the end of the month, you might want to start thinking ahead.” The goal of a budget, they say, is to have a “fixed point to track your progress against.”</span></p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/9b66a6e4-ad8d-4e45-b449-23462ef0a7cb_Screen20Shot202018-02-2320at209.58.5620AM.png" alt="Google sheets budget templates" width="600/" /></p>

Google’s Template Gallery provides a variety of visually striking, easy-to-use Google Sheets business budget templates.

Check out this well-designed </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FKg6C01Pfycf_Zq8yvNztAZmNR8QwwdkGd1mIxxLrp0/edit#gid=1280396704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual budget template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656d4449-9de7-4423-8790-7b0a15739669_Screen20Shot202018-02-2320at209.51.0120AM.png" alt="Microsoft Office budget templates" width="600" /></p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mdmproofing.com/iym/excel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It&#8217;s Your Money</a> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Your Money is a no-nonsense home for all things financial, with tons of helpful and educational resources and tips that business owners can use, no matter what your level of financial savvy.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This site provides separate sheets for service-based and goods-based businesses to create their own budgets.

<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ef150335-1505-456a-9a73-57d2b322a90e_Screen20Shot202018-02-2320at2010.12.5720AM.png" alt="Vertex 42 templates" width="600" /></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/business-budget.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertex 42</a></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another site that relies on business budget Excel template spreadsheets, Vertex 42 includes a pair of sample budgets aimed at businesses that offer services or products. It features a worksheet that breaks down, month-by-month, both sales and expenses. And for anyone considering launching a new business, the site offers a free downloadable </span><a href="https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/business-startup-costs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Start Up Costs template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out which of these small business budgets is useful in outlining the goals for your enterprise. In order for any of these templates to work, however, you must keep on top of your daily expenditures as part of your regular routine. When you get closer to really mastering your cash flow, you’ll be better equipped to grow your business in a sustainable manner for years to come.</span></p>
<h3><b>Bridging Budget Gaps</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you create your budget using a business budget template, you may find that you need help bridging a gap to hire staff or purchase pricey equipment. If that’s the case, then you might want to consider your financing options. Fundbox’s business line of credit options can step in and help when your business experiences slow sales, late invoice payments, or urgent unplanned expenses.</span></p>

<p>There comes a point when your business either has to expand to accommodate your workload or you need to cull your client list. While they may leave you for various reasons, it’s less common for a vendor to dump a client, so many may take it personally.</p>
<p>There are several valid causes to re-evaluate your client list on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve recently raised your rates and a client is unwilling (or unable) to meet the increase, that client might make the cut list.</p>
<p>Does the client demand too much of your time for too little reward? Again, they may be a candidate.</p>
<p>Has your business grown away from the services you provide a certain client? You get the idea.</p>
<p>Here are some tips on how to cut these clients with tact.</p>
<h2><strong>Give Two Weeks Notice</strong></h2>
<p>Just like a job, it’s classier to give someone standard notice instead of dropping the mic and walking out. Two weeks is a good standard, though the amount of notice you give should depend on the norms of your industry and the size and scope of work you&#8217;ve been doing for that client.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you&#8217;re in, you are more likely to get a good reference and end the relationship on a positive note if you give your client ample time to make alternative plans.</p>
<h2><strong>Give a Reason</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t just disappear. Whether you are up front with the client about money or behavior issues, or just cite “creative differences,” provide a solid reason why you are ending the relationship. Otherwise, the client will craft their own narrative as to why the relationship went sour, and their version always seems to assume the worst.</p>
<p>Also, try to make sure your excuse doesn’t have you pointing fingers at your client, putting them on the defensive.</p>
<p>If there is still an open door (ie. an increase in pay), let them know. If you want to dismiss the relationship entirely, give an ironclad excuse that’s hard for them to refute like, “I can no longer accommodate your needs.”</p>
<h2><strong>Avoid Lying</strong></h2>
<p>This may go without saying, but it&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>Most industries operate in small circles, and you never know for sure who knows who&#8230;or who might talk in the future. While it might be tempting to tell a client &#8220;it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me&#8221; when ending your working relationship, don&#8217;t give reasons that aren&#8217;t true where you could be caught in that untruth.</p>
<p>For example, you can’t tell your client you’re leaving the business, moving, or changing direction if you aren’t.</p>
<h2><strong>Finish What You Started</strong></h2>
<p>While it may be tempting to drop burdensome projects, complete the work you have to do for a client before you terminate your affiliation. Pending the project, the client may release you of your responsibility, but go in with a plan on how to wrap up loose ends.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep Apologies to a Minimum</strong></h2>
<p>While you might apologize for the inconvenience, don’t go overboard with excuses. In fact, don&#8217;t feel the need to give any excuses at all.</p>
<p>Apologies could make you appear less professional, make the client feel worse about being &#8220;dumped,&#8221; or even give your client the ability to guilt you into continuing the relationship.</p>
<p>As an adult and a professional, you have every right to decide which working relationships make sense for you. There&#8217;s no reason to apologize for exercising that right, for setting boundaries, or for changing your mind.</p>
<h2><strong>Send References</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to earn a positive client reference, consider giving your client a list of vendors or other businesses that can fill the void you will leave when you stop working together.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to do this. You can tap your network and keep track of who is looking for work. You can also refer an up-and-coming company that would appreciate the new business as much as you did when you took on the client.</p>
<p>Remember that your references reflect on you, too. If you can  provide your ex-client with a fantastic reference who can jump in and pick up where you left off, your client will remember you more kindly.</p>
<p>Leave a little wiggle room to engage with the client in the future. You never know when your paths may cross again.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of the single career. Jobs that once seemed secure have been outsourced, while many that remain have become automated or simply eliminated. In today&#8217;s &#8220;gig&#8221; economy, many workers create unconventional careers with a patchwork of jobs and <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/scaling-your-side-hustle-dont-make-these-mistakes/">side hustles</a>.</p>
<p>Understandably, today’s workforce is wary of the companies for which they work and are very aware of the instability of the modern marketplace. A workforce of mercenaries has emerged, which includes some of the most talented people in their respective professions, seeking to take more control and steer their own careers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the interest of your business to make the most of this situation. Chances are, you can profit from adding freelancers to your team. Full-time employees are certainly necessary, but there is value to be had in non-traditional, contractual workers, as well. With that in mind, here are a few places to find the free agents you need to succeed.</p>
<h2>Fiverr</h2>
<p>Founded in 2010, <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> quickly became a well-known destination for freelancers of all types, connecting anyone with access to service providers on their platform. You can find nearly any type of digital service here, from graphic design, to writing and translation, to music or video production, and tons of other options.</p>
<p>Fiverr offers over 150 categories of services, with freelancers in over 190 countries offering their services. What this means to you is that no matter what kind of help you need, and no matter what your price point, you should be able to find it here.</p>
<h2>Upwork</h2>
<p>Formerly, ElanceoDesk, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a> bills itself as the world’s largest online workplace. It claims to provide $1 billion of work annually among 4 million clients, of whom more than 90% rehire. It’s a white-collar utopia, with freelance categories such as web and mobile developers, designers, writers, sales and marketing experts, customer service agents, accountants and consultants, virtual assistants and more. You can even interview your favorite candidates right online.</p>
<h2>Craigslist</h2>
<p><a href="https://craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> still looks and feels extremely basic, but don&#8217;t be fooled. Because of its name recognition and its localized approach, Craigslist remains one of the most important sites to find workers. Just be ready for the overwhelming response. An ad on this site will generate so many emailed resumes that you might need to hire someone else just to handle the incoming traffic.</p>
<p>The downside to the ease and popularity of this site is that candidates aren’t vetted and anyone can post, so you might have to sift through a lot of noise in order to find what you need.</p>
<h2>Guru</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.guru.com/">Guru</a> boasts that you can use their platform to view more than 3.4 million services by category. Who even knew that there were that many services to be done in this world? Guru claims 1.5 million members worldwide who have completed over 1 million jobs to the tune of $200 million. Post your job for free and find your guru.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The business landscape has permanently changed, giving you access to talent from all over the world, faster than ever before. Check out some of these platforms to find the talent you need to get it all done.</p>

Starting a junk hauling business could be surprisingly profitable.</p>
<p>While the details of the job seem obvious—customers call you, you take their junk away—there are several behind-the-scenes details you need to consider before undertaking the enterprise.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips on starting a junk hauling business and getting to the top of the heap.</p>
<h2><strong>5 Tips on Starting a Junk Hauling Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Know your market<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Find out which companies are already operating in your region. Some might be national, such as 1-800-GOT-JUNK, while others might be hyper-local competitors. Know who is servicing your potential customers and how much of your territory they&#8217;re targeting.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Figure out pricing<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Once you identify your competitors, call them. Not to say &#8220;hi,&#8221; but to figure out what they&#8217;re charging. Pose as a potential customer and ask them questions about their fees for hauling <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-landscaping-business-profit-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">various kinds of refuse</a>.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Build a business plan<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you know how much you can charge for each haul, figure out how much it will cost you. Calculate your overhead, including gas, marketing, and government fees. There also may be disposal costs—some refuse will head to the landfill, while other hauls might be recycled, sold as scrap, or delivered to charities.</p>
<p>Decide if you will just offer residential junk removal or if you want to expand into commercial debris. Do you only want to work on weekdays, or will you offer weekend service? You should also consider how much heavy lifting you&#8217;re willing to do. That will factor into whether you offer curbside pickup or takeout services.</p>
<p>Be aware of any government regulation in your sector. Local, state, and federal laws often have something to say on junk disposal, especially if it counts as hazardous waste. Verify that you&#8217;re in compliance, as there could be fines for illegal disposal.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Marketing<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>A simple ad on Craigslist should help you get started. Include a picture of your truck or logo to reassure customers you&#8217;re legit. Provide clients with a phone number or email where you are readily available—customers won&#8217;t wait long for you to respond before throwing their business to a competitor. Eventually, you&#8217;ll want to set up a website.</p>
<p>Remember that you and your truck represent your company, so make sure that your vehicle and your apparel make you appear trustworthy and professional when you arrive at customers&#8217; doors.</p>
<p>Need more funds to market your junk hauling company? Try <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a>. They&#8217;ll advance you cash to cover expenses while you wait for invoices to come in.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get ranked<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Whether your customers find you via Craigslist or by word of mouth, they&#8217;re probably going to check out your customer reviews. Make sure your happy customers leave a good word or two about you on sites like Yelp and Angie&#8217;s List.</li>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re a financial advisor or tax prep expert, you may be interested in starting your own accounting firm. Owning your own company is certainly gratifying, but there are several things you need to be aware of when financing your own firm.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips you&#8217;ll appreciate before opening your own CPA practice.</p>
<h2>4 Useful Tips for Starting Your Own Accounting Firm</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Assemble your own financial plan</strong></h3>
<p>You&#8217;re used to offering financial advice to others, but now it&#8217;s your turn. Assess the costs of starting your own accounting firm and build a financial plan. Initial expenditures may include computers, accounting software, and malpractice insurance. Other expenses to consider are marketing costs, required credentials, and any other insurance you&#8217;ll need to cover your practice.</p>
<p>The plan should also determine your target market and provide a comprehensive vision on how you will oversee the administrative and financial aspects of your firm. Don&#8217;t forget to account for the cash you&#8217;ll need to live on while you wait for invoices to start rolling in. Consider that there may be a few months where you are unable to draw a salary.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Ease into it</strong></h3>
<p>Leaping into full-time entrepreneurship is a big risk. Hedge your bets by starting your accounting firm with part-time clients. Start with low-maintenance customers and incrementally take on more work. At some point, you&#8217;ll have so many clients that you no longer have time for your regular 9–5.</p>
<p>Another idea is to partner with an established accountant until you can get your own business up and running. Take the clients your partner no longer has time to handle. The benefits of working with an established partner include connections, capital, and new client relationships.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Formulate a hiring strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Starting out, be prepared to act as your company&#8217;s secretary, public relations manager, IT consultant and custodian—in addition to its sole accountant. You&#8217;ll also be required to handle all financial aspects of your company from negotiations to contracts. You may work far more hours than you did at a larger firm, but remember you&#8217;re wearing many hats.</p>
<p>Need the funds to hire great staffers? Try <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank">Fundbox</a>. Fundbox provides small businesses with simple, stress-free financing options to manage cash flow gaps and fuel business growth—if approved, you could qualify for up to $100,000 in Fundbox Credit<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-accounting-business/" target="_blank">a plan to hire help</a> once you hit a certain revenue goal. There are only so many hours in a day and you&#8217;ll need staffers to ease the burden.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Build a client base</strong></h3>
<p>You may have exited your previous firm with a few clients, but there are bigger fish out there. Clients at larger firms are always looking for more personalized service. Scoop them up and give them the attention they&#8217;re looking for.</li>

Your business also needs a solid foundation, and that starts with your plan for marketing your construction business.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t grow your business if your customers can&#8217;t find you. While the size of a marketing budget differs between companies, the overall strategies are fairly similar.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for marketing <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/solution-construction-companies-cash-flow-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your construction business</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>9 Tips for Marketing Your Construction Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Determine the end result<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Begin the process by thinking about your end game. What is your goal with your marketing plan? Do you want to massively expand your customer base? Attract a few high-end clients? Consider your long-term agenda and where you want to take your business. This will determine your target audience and where you need to invest your marketing dollars.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Research your market<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Once you determine your objectives, start collecting data on your target market. This is a great time to analyze your company&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Does <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-get-equipment-financing-for-your-construction-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your construction company</a> service mid-tier clients but fall short in catering to high-end customers? Are there any barriers to expanding? How much capital do you have to invest if your marketing strategies are successful?</p>
<p>Do your homework to figure out what&#8217;s hot in your sector and how you can take advantage of new opportunities on the horizon.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>It&#8217;s all about SEO<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Search engine optimization will generate most of your construction company&#8217;s new leads. The best thing about it? It&#8217;s free. But in order to attract traffic, you need to generate content on your website that employ the keywords customers use when searching for your services.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/?channel=ha&amp;sourceid=awo&amp;subid=us-en-ha-g-aw-c-bk_mv_exa_1!o2-201167645-170095067012-google%20keyword%20planner&amp;gclid=CMPXmvb299ICFUWNfgodKCwOkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Keyword Planner</a> to search for the keywords and phrases your customers use most when looking for your services. Then, start creating web pages, blogs, or even videos that employ those keywords to boost your visibility in online search.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Where are your customers?<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Your customers can&#8217;t respond to ads they don&#8217;t see, so assess which platforms reach your target audience. Are your customers online? Google Adwords or Facebook might be the best investments for you. Catering to the business community? Marketing your construction company in trade magazines or at conferences might be the way to go.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Build your budget<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>No one has an unlimited marketing budget, so spend more on platforms that drive traffic to your business and lighten your spending on sites that offer little return on investment. Be prepared to track your ads to make sure you see results, and tweak each ad to get maximum value.</p>
<p>Need more funds to market your construction company? Set up an account with <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a> to get the cash to meet your immediate needs.</li>

<p>If your cash flow depends on a high number of invoices, you might be vulnerable to <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/set-marketing-budget-doesnt-erode-cash-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a> blunders. It seems as simple as inflow and outflow, but keeping on top of it involves a few tips and tricks.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common problems most small business owners face when it comes to staying in the black.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoid These 5 Major Cash Flow Mistakes</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>No budget<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>You would be surprised how many entrepreneurs simply wing it when it comes to finances. If you write down your spending strategy, you&#8217;re more likely to stick to it. While it may be enticing to spend on something impulsive, you should check each purchase against your master budget. It will serve as a great guide for as to whether you should buy that new desk or save for a new computer.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Spending too much<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>It takes money to make money, but being somewhat thrifty can be a boon for business. Make sure your calendar is full before hiring any part-time or full-time staffers, and don&#8217;t make any major purchases until evaluating it for its profit-making potential.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Forgetting to save<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t foresee the future, so make sure to save some cash to protect your company&#8217;s interests. Your company&#8217;s savings account could come to the rescue when you need to wine and dine that new client or get hit with an unexpected bill. Keep at least two months of operating expenses on hand.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Getting behind on invoices<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Tracking invoices can be tedious, but putting invoices on the backburner can get you in some financial hot water. Make sure your clients are up to speed on your late-payment policies and understand the penalties associated with delayed payments. Try rewarding clients with discounts on goods or services for early payment.</p>
<p>Have trouble with late paying clients? Set up an account with Fundbox to ease the stress on your cash flow statement. Fundbox advances the full value of your invoice and doesn&#8217;t interfere with customer relationships. With Fundbox, funds are available in your bank account as soon as the next business day and will cover expenses like payroll and rent while you wait on invoices to roll in.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Forgetting about hidden fees<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Do you have loans? Often, lenders will charge you fees when you get advances on your invoices. Some lenders have monthly subscription fees or can charge you to check your credit score. Other agreements require a minimum volume of invoices each month, which might mean paying fees if you don&#8217;t hit the minimum requirements.</p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox pricing</a> is straightforward, so you can concentrate on growing your business. Registering for a Fundbox account is free, and you can pay the full invoice amount early without penalty.</li>

Now is a great to time to take stock of where your small business is heading for the rest of the year, so let&#8217;s take a moment to talk about how you plan to &#8220;spring forward&#8221; and incorporate technology into your business plan in 2017.</p>
<p>Investing time and money in new technology is a big deal for your small business. You may be operating with a micro-budget or without a IT guy. How do you know where to invest your resources?</p>
<h2><strong>5 New Tech Trends and What They Mean for Your Small Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Security<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Large companies like Target, Staples, and Home Depot have been hacked, and consumers have grown wary about handing over their personal information. Also, consider that those were major brands with top-notch IT support backing them up.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity should be one of your biggest concerns in 2017. Hackers are becoming more clever and aggressive, so make sure your clients&#8217; data is protected. Always employ the most up to date security software and that you keep your staff trained in how to manage sensitive information. Set monthly, if not weekly, reminders to make sure your systems are up to date.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Frictionless transactions<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>As consumers shift to mobile, they expect their favorite companies to do the same. The mere minutes they used to spend entering in credit card information are now too precious to waste.</p>
<p>Does your website offer PayPal? Do you give your clients an option to pay on mobile? Both Apple and Google are also gearing up for mobile payments in 2017, both on websites and in the checkout line. Your clients want to pay you with a swipe, not with cash. Make sure to make it easy for them.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Personal support<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>What do your clients or customers do when they have an issue with your product or service? Do you offer more than just a FAQ page on your website?</p>
<p>If not, then you need to update your support services to make sure your customers can engage with a human being either on the phone or online. Ideally, you have immediate customer support available through your website and via an app.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Embrace the cloud<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Make this the year that you stop saying &#8220;l&#8217;ll send it to you when I get back to the office.&#8221; No more excuses—your data should be accessible in the cloud so that when a client asks to see that proposal, it&#8217;s in their inbox before the meeting is over.</p>
<p>The cloud increases connectivity with other systems and ensures your whole staff can access important information. Of course, connecting with the cloud has its security risks, so see tech trend #1 above.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Manage a mobile office<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>With mobile devices and cloud-based infrastructure, you can afford to let your staffers work on the go. Workplace flexibility is a sought-after perk people look for in a potential employer. If you offer the ability to work from home or flexible hours, then you&#8217;ll be able to recruit top-tier talent away from some of your bigger competitors. Dedicate time and resources to building a system for staffers to communicate from wherever they&#8217;re working. Check out Slack, Basecamp, or Asana if you don&#8217;t already have a go-to communication platform aside from email.</li>

However, if you want to market your landscaping business so it flourishes in the age of the internet, you need to be digitally savvy.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s customers go online to find <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-landscaping-business-profit-fall/" target="_blank">landscaping companies</a> that are local, reliable and competitively priced. Here are a few tips to market your landscaping business and make sure it stands out in the digital space.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Ways to Digitally Market Your Landscaping Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Find your target audience online<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>It takes time to figure out where your customers live online. Does your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/boost-landscaping-cash-flow/" target="_blank">landscaping company</a> target business properties? Try targeting property managers via LinkedIn. Is your clientele residential and in their 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s? You might reach them better on Facebook.</p>
<p>Conduct informal surveys among your clients to find out what sites they use regularly and start advertising in those digital spaces.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Watch what you spend<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Spending more money on digital advertising doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll get better results. It&#8217;s best to test the waters on several sites before investing heavily into an online advertising campaign. Diversify your ad budget until you find out what generates the most traffic for your company.</p>
<p>When you do spend, make sure you&#8217;re getting what you pay for. Each site you advertise on should provide you with metrics to see how well your ads perform. Important metrics include impressions, click-through rate and cost per lead.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Manage your reviews<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>How often do you turn to Yelp or Angie&#8217;s List to make decisions? Your customers do too. In fact, these sites are often your first impression for potential clients. Find out which sites your customers use and make sure your business is well represented.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a new landscaping business, you may not have any reviews posted online. Rectify that by encouraging your current clients to write online reviews on what they like about your service. You can incentivize the reviews by offering clients discounts on future visits.</p>
<p>Already have some reviews up? Make sure to thank clients who reviewed you positively and respond to those who had questions or complaints. Most sites will allow you to flag inappropriate reviews.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>The medium matters<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Customers don&#8217;t want to read a lot of text, so your ad needs to be visual. Consider whether you want to design the ad yourself or hire an external designer. Designing your ad yourself will cost you time while opting for a contractor will cost more money. Decide which is more precious to your business.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to decide if your ad campaign is static or video. How do you choose? It depends on where your advertising.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re advertising on a site that people read—like a local newspaper website—then a banner ad or graphic is perfect. Consider creating a small graphic reminding readers that summer barbecue season is fast approaching, then link it to your site. It is a simple yet effective way to generate interest in your lawn services.</p>
<p>What if you&#8217;re trying to reach people on social media? Video ads are another effective way to go. Shoot a 15–30 second targeted video ad about a topic—spring planting, perhaps. Run the spot on YouTube channels or inserted into local Facebook feeds to give your business some credibility.</li>
