This solution gives small business owners a simple way to fix their cash flow by advancing invoices without ever having to leave their QuickBooks account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn’t be more excited to be partnering with Intuit to make it even easier for small business to access the capital they need to run &amp; grow their businesses in one click. The ease of having the Fundbox experience inside of QuickBooks supports our philosophy of using technology to empower small businesses while delivering an amazing customer experience. As VP of Intuit Small Business Group Alex Chriss said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all about making it is easier for small businesses to access the short-term financing they need at the click of a button.&#8221; He continued, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our partnership with Fundbox enables us to deliver a financing solution to our small business customers that streamlines the application process, offers quicker decision making and most importantly, offers fair and transparent pricing.”  </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work?  QuickBooks Online users will have access to a new ‘Advance Payment’ button inside of their QuickBooks, on the Sales Transactions tab:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/QBO-ADV-PAY-BUTTON.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3266" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/QBO-ADV-PAY-BUTTON.png" alt="Fundbox QuickBooks Online" width="1118" height="612" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/QBO-ADV-PAY-BUTTON.png 1118w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/QBO-ADV-PAY-BUTTON-768x420.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1118px) 100vw, 1118px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For existing Fundbox customers, if you select ‘Advance Payment’ within QuickBooks Online, you’ll follow a similar process as you do today, all without ever having to open a new window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers new to Fundbox will be walked through Fundbox account creation within QuickBooks Online. In less than 3 hours, you’ll be able to start advancing outstanding invoices and have money in your bank account as soon as the next business day. </span></p>

<p>The investment was led by <b>Khosla Ventures</b> and includes <b>SV Angel</b> and <b>Vikram Pandit</b>, the former chief executive of <b>Citigroup,</b> and several other distinguished investors.
