We kept all the existing features, added more functionality and made it even easier for you to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming soon, but for now, here is what you can expect with the brand new Fundbox dashboard.</p>
<p><b>What’s New: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll now see your Invoices and Advances on two separate tabs. By separating these two, we’ve made it easier for you to find your invoices more quickly and see all of your outstanding advances to help you make better business decisions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All of the fees and payments are now clearly displayed so that you can tell immediately when your payment is due.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You’ll also always see your upcoming payment information so you can tell what your next weekly payment will be. No surprises and no calculations on your side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The new projected credit bar lets you see what clearing a new invoice will do to your Fundbox credit, so you’ll always know how much Fundbox credit you have. With this new tool, you’ll know what invoices are better for you to clear and make smarter use of your Fundbox credit.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re looking for a specific invoice or an advance, you’ll now have additional sort functionally including by amount, customer, due date or invoice number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you clear, the new side pane will show you all the associated fees and all details regarding the repayment schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you chose to repay early, this new side pane will show you how much you are saving, the total repayment amount and the date it will be debited from your bank account so you can better manage your finances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mobile Ready!</b></p>
<p>In addition, to all these great new updates, the new Fundbox dashboard is fully optimized for mobile so you can manage your Fundbox account on-the-go. Anything you can do on the desktop, you can do on your mobile browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b></b>Plus a lot more coming soon! As always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions to yourfriends@fundbox.com.</p>
