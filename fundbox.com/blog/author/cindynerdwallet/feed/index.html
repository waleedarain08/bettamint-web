<p>In the construction business, heavy equipment is critical to success, but the cost can be brutal to bear. Unless your budget can spare the cash, you’ll have to find the right equipment financing to fund the purchase. Here’s how.</p>
<h2><strong>Where to find equipment financing</strong></h2>
<p>You can obtain construction equipment financing from banks, credit unions, equipment manufacturing companies, and supply companies, as well as other independent and online lenders. There are three main equipment financing options to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Equipment leasing</li>
<li>Equipment loans</li>
<li>Small business loans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you choose a financing source and option, you’ll need to assess what kind of construction equipment you’ll need. First, determine what type of machinery, vehicles, or other equipment you want to finance. Decide if you’ll want the newest equipment updated regularly, or if you need something built to last. Once you have determined all of your needs, decide which of these three equipment-financing options will be best for you.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Equipment leasing</strong></h3>
<p>By leasing equipment, you can save money and have the benefit of getting the most up-to-date equipment. You can expect lower monthly payments than you would with an equipment or business loan. You also won’t typically have to put a down payment on the equipment to get started.</p>
<p>Leasing is more flexible than a loan, and you can often negotiate terms more easily. For instance, if you find at the end of the lease that you want to keep the equipment, you may be able to purchase the equipment at a reduced price. Or, if you find you don’t need the equipment anymore, you can always return the equipment. You’ll have to pay an early termination fee, but you won’t be stuck making payments on something you no longer need.</p>
<p>Your rental payment will be tax-deductible, but leasing doesn’t provide a depreciation tax benefit. Interest rates also tend to be higher than equipment or small business loans, and you also won’t be building equity as you make payments.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. Equipment loan</strong></h3>
<p>With an equipment loan, you own the equipment from day one. Much like a car, once you repay the loan, your equipment can be used as equity toward a new piece of equipment. At the end of the loan, you may be able to arrange a sale-and-leaseback agreement in which you sell equipment to your finance company for cash, then lease the equipment from the lender.</p>
<p>An equipment loan is often easier to get than a small business loan since credit standards are less strict and rely on other factors, such as experience with equipment. Plus, since equipment has inherent collateral, a lender can always get the equipment back to lend or resell. There are tax advantages to own equipment too—you can enjoy a tax deductible on interest and a depreciation tax benefit over time.</p>
<p>Typically, equipment lenders will require a down payment before you receive equipment. However, depending on your assets or equity, you may be able to avoid putting much money—if any—down first. If you have enough assets, the bank will use those assets as collateral and shoulder the entire burden of financing without requiring a down payment. This means, however, in the event of a loan default, your assets may be seized.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Small business loan</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/small-business-loans" target="_blank">Small business loans</a> can be used to pay for equipment as well. The term of the loan should match or be less than the expected lifespan of the equipment. You don’t want to be paying off equipment longer than you use it.</p>
<p>If you opt for a small business loan, look for the lowest annual percentage rates (APR). You can usually get the best rates from banks and credit unions, but you’ll need good credit to qualify. If your credit is less than optimal, your best bet will be with an online small business loan provider. Loans found online will be easier to obtain, but the interest rates are usually higher than those offered by traditional lenders.</p>
<p>Because construction equipment is so expensive and necessary for the industry, you may have to take out very large loans to fund a purchase. This can deplete your ability to borrow money in case you have other business funding needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Final consideration</strong></h2>
<p>Before you choose an equipment financing option for your construction business, you should also consider the type of maintenance needs the equipment will have. Some equipment leases may offer servicing in case of breakdowns or other malfunctions, but others won’t. Still, if you’re willing to pay someone else to fix equipment or if you can do it yourself, then purchasing equipment could be your best option.</p>

But managing your venture also comes with far more costs, and the amount of money you’ll need to spend to turn a profit can be downright shocking to new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>If mounting costs have you feeling cash-strapped, here are 10 tips to reduce your small-business expenses and improve your bottom line.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Renegotiate vendor contracts</strong><br />
It’s easy to sign a contract with a vendor, such as a snack supplier or printing company, then forget about it. If your small business has a solid track record with its vendors, call and ask if you can renegotiate your contract for a better rate. Some vendors may be willing to offer a discount if you commit to a longer contract or pay annually instead of monthly.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Shop in bulk</strong><br />
If your business is growing, save by buying in bulk. Wholesale purchasing isn’t just for office snacks and drinks; it can also be a good way to save on software and furniture. If your business is too small to buy in bulk, team up with another business or an association and go in on purchases together.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Compare financing options carefully</strong><br />
Many small businesses reach a point where they need to borrow money in order to grow, but selecting the wrong kind of financing can cost big bucks in fees and interest payments. For example, you can get quick and easy financing with a merchant cash advance, but the effective interest rates can be astronomical. Credit cards help if you need a few purchases, but APRs can be too high for those who plan to carry a large balance. Take the time to research and compare financing options, such as a traditional or alternative <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/best-business-loans">business loan</a>, line of credit, equipment financing and <a href="https://fundbox.com">invoice financing</a>, so you end up with capital that works for you rather than against you.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">4. Eliminate unused expenses</strong><br />
Are you spending money each month on goods or services that you no longer need? Carefully review your budget to see if anything can go. Perhaps, you can end subscriptions for trade magazines you don’t read or cut memberships at organizations where you aren’t active.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">5. Automate where you can</strong><br />
Save time and money by finding ways to <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-business-functions-you-should-be-automating-with-software/">automate processes</a>. For example, instead of manually sending contracts and paperwork to every new client, you could digitally automate the process with a tool like <a href="https://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a>. Or perhaps you take paper checks only because you don’t want to pay fees to accept electronic payments or credit cards, but inefficiencies caused by manual payment processing cuts into your bottom line.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">6. Hunt for deals and discounts</strong><br />
If you’re buying office furniture or technology, consider shopping for lightly used items — look for business liquidation sales — for significant savings. Many trade organizations offer discounts on products and services for members, so find out if you’re eligible for any savings. Also, see if your business credit card comes with perks; many cards offer discounts on office supplies, rental cars and other business expenses (and have rewards programs that can score you free travel and goods).</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">7. Manage inventory wisely</strong><br />
If you run an inventory-based business, keeping more supplies on hand than necessary ties up cash that can be better used elsewhere. Start tracking inventory closely to ensure you’re only buying what’s needed. If you currently manage inventory manually, consider adopting software that makes it easier to track.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">8. Try bartering</strong><br />
Bartering is a time-tested way to get what you need without spending cash. Find other businesses willing to trade goods or services that you need. Say you own a website design firm and badly need a bookkeeper — there may be an accountant willing to manage your books in exchange for building and maintaining a website. If you’re not sure where to start, some quick Googling will lead you to a slew of websites that facilitate bartering between businesses.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">9. Take advantage of tax deductions</strong><br />
It takes time to track your tax deductions, but the payoff can be huge. If you work from a home office, you can likely deduct a portion of your rent or mortgage interest and utilities. You can also deduct for car mileage driven for work and money spent to entertain clients. Small-business owners can get tax breaks for purchasing equipment, acquiring hybrid cars and other expenses — work with an accountant to find out what you can deduct to reduce your tax bill.</p>
<p><strong>10. Cut back on energy use</strong><br />
Many businesses don’t pay attention to how much energy they’re consuming, but being proactive can cut your utility bills. If you haven’t yet, switch to energy-efficient lighting such as compact fluorescent bulbs. If your staff forgets to turn off the lights when they leave, consider adding motion-sensing fixtures. Be sure to adjust the thermostat at the end of the day, so you’re not paying for heating or cooling when the office is empty. Also consider improving insulation and updating windows to keep energy costs down.</p>
