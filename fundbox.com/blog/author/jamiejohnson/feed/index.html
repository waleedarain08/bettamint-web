It provides coverage to small businesses for claims resulting from bodily injury, property damage, copyright infringement, and reputation harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look more closely at what general liability insurance covers, what it doesn’t cover, and who needs it. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance coverage protects your business from some of the most common claims </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/llc-business-taxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business owners face</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Paying for any one of these would be incredibly expensive without some kind of business insurance to cover you. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party bodily injury</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a brick-and-mortar business and a customer is injured at your store, you’re responsible for covering their medical costs. Not to mention, if it’s determined that the accident is your fault, that customer could decide to sue you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unfortunately, these types of accidents are not uncommon. </span><a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2015/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Hartford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 10% of businesses have a customer slip and fall on their premises, and these accidents cost about $30,000 to resolve. General liability insurance will cover any costs involved with a customer accident. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party property damage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property damage is another common liability claim. This happens when a customer’s property is damaged while they are at your business or when a customer’s property is damaged while you’re visiting them on business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of this is a general contractor accidentally damaging a client’s property while working on their home. As a business owner, you’re responsible for paying for the necessary repairs. General liability insurance will cover some or all of the associated costs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement happens when you’re accused of stealing someone else’s ideas and using them in your marketing or advertising. It can also involve claims that you copied another company’s product and sold it as your own. This can be an expensive problem to fix, especially if it leads to a lawsuit. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm happens when you make a public statement about a business owner that hurts their business. According to The Hartford, reputation management is the most expensive problem most businesses encounter and can cost up to $50,000 to fix. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Isn’t Covered By Business Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business liability insurance is a comprehensive insurance policy that covers some of the most common incidents business owners face. But it doesn’t cover everything, and knowing what isn’t covered is just as important as knowing what is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no insurance policy is the same, so you should check the policy guidelines for your general liability insurance policy. But here are some of the most common exclusions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Auto accidents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> general liability insurance doesn’t cover auto accidents that happen while you or your employees are on the job. Commercial auto insurance can protect you from these types of accidents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employee injuries: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee becomes injured as a result of their work, general liability insurance doesn’t cover that either. Workers’ compensation insurance protects employees from workplace accidents or illnesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Damage to your property:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> General liability insurance protects you from damage to a customer’s property, but it won’t protect you from your own property damage. Commercial property insurance can help with that.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Professional errors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, general liability insurance won’t cover you if a customer sues you due to a professional error that harms their business. Professional liability insurance will help with that. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s always a good idea to be aware of the coverage limits on your general liability policy. If you feel like your coverage is a bit low, it may be worthwhile to purchase a commercial umbrella insurance policy to cover more expensive claims.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Coverage Do I Need?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/cost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Insureon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most small businesses choose a standard coverage limit of $1 million per occurrence with a $2 million aggregate policy limit. So for a single claim, you’ll receive up to $1 million with a $2 million limit for that policy period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you will have to pay the insurance deductible before the insurance company will payout on your claim. You’ll choose your deductible when you initially purchase general liability insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of your deductible, the type of business you run, and your industry will all affect your monthly insurance rate. Insureon also found that the median cost of general liability insurance is $42 per month or $500 annually. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Needs General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most states won’t require business owners to carry small business liability insurance, so you can purchase this insurance at your own discretion. But if you choose to forgo general liability insurance, you could be putting your business and your livelihood at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, most businesses need general liability insurance, especially if you own an office or storefront that’s open to customers or vendors. And some clients may not want to do business with you unless you can show proof of insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should strongly consider purchasing business liability insurance if any of the following apply to your business: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a store or office building that’s open to clients, customers, or vendors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly do work on a client’s physical property</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly create advertising or marketing campaigns for your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You use social media for advertising your business and communicating with customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rent or own commercial property</span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bottom Line</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can save you from some of the most common accidents small businesses face. Suppose a customer is injured at your workplace, or you accidentally damage their property. In that case, business liability insurance will protect you from any medical bills and lawsuits that arise as a result. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I need liability insurance for my small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most small businesses can benefit from general liability insurance. It is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can protect you financially if you’re ever involved in a lawsuit or if a customer is injured on your property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate an office or storefront that’s open to customers, work on a customer’s property, or own commercial property, you should probably purchase small business liability insurance. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does general liability insurance cover for a small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance covers claims related to the following incidents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bodily injury:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A customer has an accident or is injured on your business premises.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Property damage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You accidentally damage a customer’s property during business operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Copyright infringement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re accused of stealing another company’s ideas and using them in a marketing or advertising campaign.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reputation harm: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re accused of slandering another company, and it damages their business.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1362182585-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Two entrepreneurs talking together in a coffee shop about a business partnership, multicultural owners discussing plan of cooperation." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1362182585-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1362182585.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you want to do everything you can to help your business be successful. But in the early days of building a business, time and money are often in short supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why you might consider <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/tips-for-partnering-with-another-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forming a strategic partnership</a> with another business. A strategic partnership is one of the best ways to combine your resources for future growth. It can help you reach a wider audience and access tools and resources you wouldn’t have otherwise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what is a strategic partnership, and how can forming one help your business grow? That’s exactly what this article will set out to explain. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a strategic business partnership?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a strategic partnership, two businesses agree to share their resources to achieve further growth and mutual success. For instance, you might partner with another company in your industry to reach a new target market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategic partnerships are beneficial for companies of all sizes, but they can be extremely helpful for small businesses. That’s because a strategic partnership can be a key growth strategy that allows you to compete with larger businesses.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the three types of strategic partnerships?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Joint venture:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a joint venture, two companies combine their resources to accomplish a specific objective. Each company is responsible for the costs and profits that come from the venture. However, they remain two separate business entities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Equity strategic alliance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In an equity strategic alliance, one company purchases equity in another company. Or sometimes, both companies will buy equity in the other company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Non-equity strategic alliance: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a non-equity strategic alliance, two or more companies sign a contract to combine their resources. But they don’t create a separate entity or share any equity. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a good strategic partnership?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like you spent time thinking about your ideal customer, it’s also a good idea to spend some time thinking about your ideal business partnership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things to look for is that both companies can offer something of unique value to the other. If the relationship is too one-sided, it’s unlikely to work long-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, it’s a good idea to partner with companies that aren’t your direct competitors. A good strategic partner will add value to your customers without directly competing with your products or services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And both companies need to be excited about the partnership. Again, if one business receives significantly more value than the other, the partnership will most likely fall apart. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you create a strategic partnership?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strategic partnership</a> is a great way to expand your customer base, leverage additional resources, and grow your revenue. But you want to make sure you go about it in the right way. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t rush the process</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anytime you’re entering into a new strategic partnership, it’s essential to set a strong foundation. This is especially important when each company has a significant <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial stake in the partnership</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take some time to discuss your company culture, communication style, and expectations. Don’t just assume that everyone involved is on the same page &#8212; take the time to think through how you’ll interact and collaborate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this will give your partnership the best chance of being successful. It can help to create a written vision for how you’ll work together and what you plan to accomplish. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain strong communication</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the strongest business relationship can erode due to poor communication. One of the best ways to avoid this is by scheduling regular meetings to talk about the business. Not only will this give your partnership the best chance of success, but it will also help you build trust on both sides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And each business will bring different skill sets and resources to the table. So if possible, try to let both sides focus on what they do best. For instance, one company may excel at sales marketing while the other may be better at forecasting and budgeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, invest in the tools and processes that will help both businesses work together effectively. The right resources can help you bridge the occasional communication gap. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take time to reassess</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relationships change and evolve, and strategic business partnerships are no different. That’s why it’s a good idea to regularly reassess where you’re at and if the partnership is still beneficial for both sides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are your priorities still aligned, and are both companies still focused on the end goal? These kinds of conversations can be uncomfortable, but they will help you avoid bigger problems in the long run. </span></p>
