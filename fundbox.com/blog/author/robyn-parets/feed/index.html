The good news is that you may be getting a tax refund. By now, you may have already received a refund check from Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Now, the big question is: What are you going to do with that cash? It&#8217;s certainly enticing to spend your refund right away by paying off bills or cutting bonus checks for your employees. But before you spend that money, consider how you can effectively put that tax refund to work for the long-term growth of your business.</p>
<p>To help you along, here are five ideas for how to spend that money wisely.</p>
<h1><strong>5 Ways to Spend Your Tax Refund (Wisely)</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>1. Power to your people</strong></h2>
<p>Your employees are your best resources, and investing in training your team is a smart way to use your recent windfall. Training programs and resources help keep employees productive, engaged, and more actively involved in contributing to your company&#8217;s success. To boot, employees will feel more valued—boosting morale and resulting in a happier workforce.</p>
<p>Morale might sound hard to define, but it has a major, quantifiable impact on your business success. According to the <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/dna-engagement2017/">Engagement Institute</a>, disengaged employees cost organizations between $450 and $550 billion annually due to losses in productivity and other factors. On the retention side, <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/employee-pulse/">Qualtrics</a> reports that employees with a high confidence level in their company’s senior leadership are 5 times as likely to remain with their employer more than 2 years compared to employees with no confidence. One of the best ways to retain star employees (and to keep all employees more engaged) is to invest in employee wellbeing, training and resources.</p>
<h2><strong>2. All systems a go<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that technology changes fast. Even the systems you bought just last year may be in need of an upgrade. Or perhaps you put off buying new accounting software or marketing tools because new technology wasn&#8217;t in your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balancing-a-small-business-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">budget</a>.</p>
<p>Now may be the right time to take a look at the systems you have in place and those that are on your wishlist. Even earmarking a small amount toward new technology can help improve your business  efficiency and free up your team to work on new projects.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Get ahead of the next tax cycle<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>If there&#8217;s nothing you absolutely need to invest in right now, this is a great time to make some plans for the future. With plenty of breathing room, you might take a look at <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/new-tax-law-implications-business-owners/">the new tax law</a> and any upcoming changes that may affect your business next year. You could review your investment plan, to make sure that your savings are growing.</p>
<p>Finally, you might use this time to find an accounting professional or financial advisor you can trust to work with, next time you need assistance or expert advice.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-owners-can-leverage-accounting-resources/">Learn how business owners can leverage accounting resources</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>4. Seeing green</strong></h2>
<p>Spending your tax refund on energy-efficient systems may not be at the top of your list, but you&#8217;ll be glad to know that the federal government offers rebates and tax credits on certain types of energy-saving business expenditures. Better yet, buying certain energy-saving products could also mean ongoing savings in the way of lower electric and heating bills.</p>
<p>For example, if you install solar panels on your business property, you may be able to <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/residential/solar-energy-tax-credits-rebates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deduct 30% of the cost of the system off your federal taxes</a>, according to solar provider SolarCity. You can even roll over your solar tax credit to next year if you don&#8217;t expect to owe taxes this year. Rebates and state tax credits on various other systems and products, including heating, lights and insulation, are available as well. Rebates and tax credits vary state to state. To see what you might qualify for, you can view a list of savings on the Federal Energy Department&#8217;s <a href="http://energy.gov/savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Payback time<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>To help fund your business, you may have taken out a small business loan, home equity line, or eaten away at your business credit card access line. With an influx of cash in the form of a tax refund, this could be a good time to review what you owe and determine whether you can allocate any of your tax refund dollars toward paying down your business debts.</p>
<p>In the long run, lowering debt and your payments will free up your company&#8217;s available cash flow. This way, you can begin spending your money on other resources with the ultimate goal of expanding your business.</p>
<p>To learn more about ways in which you can save, spend, or invest your tax refund, it&#8217;s a good idea to discuss your options with an accountant or financial advisor.</p>

This annual event, run by the U.S. Small Business Administration, draws awareness to the nation&#8217;s 28 million small businesses. Yet, many small business owners tend to think of this week, held April 30-May 6, as a marketing plug.</p>
<p>While the event does provide a great way to promote your small business, did you know that there&#8217;s more to <a href="https://www.sba.gov/nsbw/nsbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Small Business Week</a> than marketing gimmicks and hashtags? In fact, there are loads of free workshops and events—many of them specifically for women entrepreneurs. If you take advantage of these programs, you can get business advice that you would ordinarily have to pay big bucks for. Here&#8217;s how women entrepreneurs can tap into these programs and sign up for business boosting events close to home or online.</p>
<h2><strong>Participate in Local Small Business Week Events</strong></h2>
<p>Along with an awards ceremony in Washington D.C. honoring several small business owners, National Small Business Week takes its show on the road May 1–5. SBA Administrator <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/writing-your-success-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda McMahon</a> is onsite for <a href="https://www.sba.gov/blogs/get-ready-national-small-business-week?platform=hootsuite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events</a> in Indianapolis, Arlington, TX and Fresno, CA. If you don&#8217;t live in any of these locations, don&#8217;t worry. You can watch the events <a href="https://www.sba.gov/nsbw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-streamed online</a>. In addition to the national roadshow, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regional SBA chapters</a> are offering their own events. Also jumping into the act are National Small Business Week sponsors and local chambers of commerce with specialty programming. You can even find several city-wide programs in celebration of small business week. We did a little digging and came up with some worthwhile free events for women entrepreneurs. Take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Chicago, <a href="https://www.freerangeoffice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Range office</a> is offering an all-day <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/small-business-week-womens-collective-tickets-33669721042?aff=erellivmlt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women&#8217;s Collective Forum</a> on May 2, as well as <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/small-business-week-networking-reception-tickets-33670544505?ref=ebtn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an evening reception and panel discussion</a> on May 4. Kicking off the week, the collective day-long event starts with a networking breakfast, followed by a Q&amp;A on the unique challenges women face when starting and growing businesses. The event also features speaker Melissa Ford of <a href="http://melissafordcoaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Ford Coaching</a> and a mindfulness workshop presented by<a href="http://erinracheldoppelt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Erin Rachel Doppelt</a>. The May 4 evening event will include a talk on &#8220;Being Your Own Brand for Business Success&#8221; with a panel of female business experts including Nathalie Rosado, associate director of the <a href="https://www.wbdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Women&#8217;s Business Development Center,</a> Vanessa Valentin, associate director of marketing at WBDC, Kymberlee Kaye Raya, founder of <a href="http://www.bigshotmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Shot Marketing Inc</a>., and Kimberly Jackson, founder of Stand-In.</li>
<li>In New York, The State University of New York at Stony Brook Small Business Development Center (SBDC) is offering the Women&#8217;s Empowerment Circle on Thursday, May 4 from 5:30-8 pm. After a light dinner and networking, attendees will hear from Maria Camassa, CPA and business owner, and Ronni Rosen, a senior business advisor at Stony Brook SBDC. The evening will also feature motivational speaker Suzanne Borelli, who will discuss how to &#8220;live your life in the front row.&#8221;</li>
<li>In California, the <a href="https://www.capitalregionsbdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capital Region Small Business Week Celebration</a> offers a full slate of events from May 1-5. Although these are not specifically for women entrepreneurs, these programs can be valuable to women business owners. For example, the &#8220;Roadmap to Success: Small Business Symposium&#8221; on May 2 offers resources and answers for those just starting out in business, such as where to find <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">funding sources</a>, <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-reasons-change-ownership-shares-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what form of ownership </a>is best for your business, and valuable tax information. To sign up or learn more, go to the event website.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Participate in Online Small Business Week Webinars</strong></h2>
<p>If you can&#8217;t get away from your day-to-day responsibilities to attend a workshop or event in-person, you can still get involved online. Other than the national live-streamed events, National Small Business Week is hosting a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/nsbw/webinars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of webinars</a>. Targeted to all small business owners, women entrepreneurs may be interested in registering for <a href="https://cc.readytalk.com/registration/#/?meeting=v0iioflv4wvh&amp;campaign=mmcrl3tbysfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Find the Hidden Money in America&#8221;</a> on May 4, presented by media mogul <a href="http://www.nelygalan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nely Galan</a>. Galan was the first Latina president of entertainment for Telemundo and is the author of the New York Times best-selling book, SELF MADE. Galan will discuss how entrepreneurship provides a path to empowerment and offers advice on where to find financial resources.</p>
<p>You can also use social media to keep up with events and news about National Small Business week by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/SBAgov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SBA on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SBAgov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>. If you <a href="https://www.sba.gov/nsbw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go to the small business week webpage</a>, you&#8217;ll find the latest tweets there or you can use the hashtag #SmallBusinessWeek to stay in the know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_327644201-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="4 Ways to Boost Sales Without Discounting" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_327644201-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_327644201.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>If you own a small business, you know what it&#8217;s like to experience a sales slump. Watching your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a> dry up can be stressful—even if <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you run a seasonal business </a>and you deal with this often. In fact, you may feel anxious waiting around for your sales to pick up again. This can cause you to make a snap decision to try to boost sales by discounting prices.</p>
<p>Before you do this, however, you might want to think again. Discounting products and services may seem like a smart way to boost sales, but this can actually hurt your sales in the long run. That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a direct correlation between price, discounting, and a consumer&#8217;s perception of value, according to <a href="http://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/bid/170106/How-Discounting-is-Killing-Your-Pricing-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Price Intelligently</a>. In other words, the bigger the discount, the lower the perceived value of your products. This means that your customers may be less likely to pay regular prices in the future—leaving you in a <a href="http://www.slantmarketing.com/how-to-drive-e-commerce-sales-without-discounting/">constant cycle</a> of discounting.</p>
<p>If discounting isn&#8217;t the best way to build value in your brand and boost sales, then what is? There&#8217;s no easy answer, but if you get creative, these 4 marketing tips can help you boost sales without devaluing your brand. Better yet, you won&#8217;t spend any money—a welcome relief when your sales volume is low. Read on to learn more.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Ways to Boost Sales Without Discounting</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Implement a loyalty program<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>According to Slant Marketing, members of loyalty programs<a href="http://www.slantmarketing.com/how-to-drive-e-commerce-sales-without-discounting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> spend 13% more than average customers</a>. You can use <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/customer-loyalty-increase-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a loyalty program to offer rewards and perks </a>to your most faithful customers. The end result: You&#8217;ll attract new customers as well as keep existing members coming back.</p>
<p>Once you have an established loyalty program complete with an active customer base, you might then consider running some targeted sales. This way, you can consider this a thank-you rather than an angst-ridden attempt at discounting prices for a quick <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow fix</a>.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>The write stuff<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t already have a company blog, now is a great time to start one. Likewise, if you have a blog but never write anything, <a href="https://thrivehive.com/10-tips-for-starting-a-successful-blog-for-your-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now is the time to get cracking.</a> <a href="https://thrivehive.com/how-to-market-yourself-to-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogging is an effective way to market</a> to your customers. It also gives you an outlet to position yourself as a knowledgeable resource in your field. Better yet, <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/does-your-business-need-a-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogging can improve your SEO and help you rank higher in a Google search. </a>This in turn can drive traffic back to your website and keep customers there to shop or learn more about your business.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get reviews<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that only about two percent of online shoppers convert to buying customers on the first visit to a website? This means that regardless of what type of business you operate, you have to work hard to build trust in order to garner sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-market-millennials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer reviews are one of the top ways to build trust</a>. In fact, 61% of customers read reviews before making a purchase, and reviews are trusted 12 times more than product descriptions. Here&#8217;s the kicker: Reviews lead to an 18% uptick in product sales.</p>
<p>If you have no reviews yet, no worries. You can ask a few customers to write brief, positive reviews and post them on <a href="https://www.yelp.com/sf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp</a> or to your Facebook page. You can then use your social media channels to share these positive testimonials.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get social<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>If you are not already using social media to boost sales by marketing your business, products, or services in a big way, now is the time to start. According to Pew Research Center,<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/08/social-networking-usage-2005-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 65% of adults were using social media sites in 2015</a>—almost a ten-fold increase since 2005. As you can imagine, that percentage is probably even higher now.</p>
<p>Indeed, your customers are likely already using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest to engage and communicate with their favorite businesses and brands. By beefing up your online presence, you can join the party and begin actively engaging with your customers. For example, you can use <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/valentines-day-marketing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook to run contests tied into a holiday</a> or a company anniversary. You can also use social media to post industry news, tout new hires, and talk about exciting new product offerings. And, now that you&#8217;re blogging, you can use Facebook and Twitter to generate buzz for your blog posts. One more thing: Let&#8217;s not forget about those new reviews. You can maximize exposure for your positive testimonials by sharing these with your followers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of which marketing tactics you dive into first, the sky&#8217;s the limit when you put on your marketing hat. Remember: These are all free ways to gain and retain customers, as well as increase your sales.</p>

While<a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> invoice financing</a> helps you handle your cash flow gaps and get paid faster, it&#8217;s still your responsibility to send invoices and ultimately collect payments from your customers.</p>
<p>With so many invoicing tools available to help you manage your finances, it&#8217;s not always easy to decide which platform is best for your business. For this reason, we&#8217;ve put together a list of budget-friendly tools to create professional invoices and help you get paid faster. Take a look:</p>
<h2><strong>4 Easy Ways to Send Invoices</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>QuickBooks</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuit&#8217;s QuickBooks</a> is a popular full-scale accounting choice among small business owners. Among a host of other bookkeeping features, QuickBooks offers an easy way to manage and send invoices. QuickBooks touts several different price points and packages. Out of all of the options, QuickBooks Self-Employed is perhaps best-suited to freelancers who want to both create and send invoices. Starting at $4 a month, you can <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/self-employed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create and send invoices on the go</a><u>,</u> and if you enable online payments, you can get paid by credit card or bank transfer.<a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> QuickBooks Online</a>, on the other hand, is a more immersive option for small businesses. It allows you—or maybe <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-to-hire-a-bookkeeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bookkeeper</a>—to gain access to the platform from any device. Pricing starts at $10 a month, and with QuickBooks online, you can send invoices that accept credit and debit card payments, take payments using free bank transfers, and set up recurring invoices with reminder notices.</p>
<h3><strong>FreshBooks</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreshBooks</a> cloud accounting system is another well-known invoicing tool for small business owners and self-employed freelancers. It offers an all-in-one platform for managing bookkeeping tasks, which includes invoicing and sending late payment reminders. According to FreshBooks, its average customer <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/self-employed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saves over 16 hours a month</a> by using FreshBooks to eliminate the hassle of creating invoices and collecting payments. Clients can pay invoices directly through FreshBooks using credit cards. Pricing plans starting at $15 a month, plus you&#8217;ll pay an extra credit card payment fee per transaction (typically 2.9% plus 30 cents). You can try <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FreshBooks for free</a> for your first 30 days.</p>
<h3><strong>Wave</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to <em>free</em> invoicing, <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wave</a> is riding the crest. Creating a Wave account takes less than a minute. You&#8217;re then on your way to creating and sending customized invoices using a myriad of available templates. Among the <a href="https://www.waveapps.com/invoice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many Wave features</a>: You can use the simple system to send follow-up statements for overdue accounts, issue payment reminders to your clients, and send professional receipts. You can also use the Wave app to send invoices from your phone and accept credit card payments. This option will cost you a typical credit card transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents.</p>
<h3><strong>Hiveage</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.hiveage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiveage</a>, formerly called Curdbee, is similar to Wave, yet it&#8217;s not free. The basic Hiveage package <a href="https://www.hiveage.com/online-invoicing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts at $15 a month</a>, although you can give it a free test run for the first 14 days. Hiveage is a bit more comprehensive in its offerings than Wave and may be a better option if you run more than one business or have multiple employees who also use it. Hiveage offers business owners the ability <a href="https://www.hiveage.com/manage-multiple-teams-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to share invoicing functions among employees</a> or manage invoicing for more than one company from a single account. When it comes to accepting payment on invoices, Hiveage raises the bar by allowing your clients to pay with major credit cards, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal,</a> <a href="https://wepay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WePay </a>and <a href="https://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>When deciding which invoicing tool is best for your business, you may also want to consider <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-apps-tools-manage-your-cash-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrating your bookkeeping platform with Fundbox.</a> This way, you can create and send invoices and get paid immediately via Fundbox while awaiting payment from your clients. Here&#8217;s how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox </a>account and select a bookkeeping app from a list of partners (which includes QuickBooks and FreshBooks).</li>
<li>If approved, you can then choose the invoice you want to advance.</li>
<li>The amount of that invoice is transferred via Fundbox into your bank account as soon as one business day.</li>
<li>You pay Fundbox back via weekly payments over either a 12 or 24-week repayment period.</li>
<li>You deal with collecting from your client via the chosen payment method on your invoicing platform—Fundbox doesn&#8217;t interfere with your client relationships.</li>
</ul>

It can also be challenging, especially if circumstances change with one of the owners. For example, if you start to work more hours at the company than your co-owners or one of the founders leaves the small business, it may be time to change ownership shares.</p>
<p>Even if your company&#8217;s ownership formation is working well at the moment, it&#8217;s a good idea to understand what types of circumstances may cause this to change. Take a look at 4 reasons why you may decide to <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">split profits differently </a>in your business.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Reasons to Change Ownership Shares in Your Small Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>You decide to invest more money into the small business<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s how a scenario like this might happen. Let&#8217;s say you launched your small business with two friends or colleagues. Initially, the three of you ponied up equal amounts to start the company. But that was two years ago, and now the firm needs another cash infusion in order to continue growing. You&#8217;ve discussed this with your partners, but neither of them have the money. You, on the other hand, have the funds and wish to put your cash back into the business. In return for your investment, however, you&#8217;d like a larger percentage of the company (change ownership shares). If you and your co-owners are able to work out an agreement, this may result in a higher ownership stake for you.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>You decide to work full-time at your company<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>If you spend more hours working at your small business than your partners, this may give you an incentive to ask for more of the company&#8217;s profits. Take a look at this example. Up until now, you and your partners have been running the small business as a side hustle. All three of you work at other full-time jobs and you each own about 33.33% of the company. For your first year in business, you haven&#8217;t been able to afford to leave your job and neither have your partners. But, you&#8217;ve been saving money and you got married, giving your household a second income. You have decided that now is the time to take a risk, quit your job, and work at your business full-time. You discussed this with your partners, and all of you have decided that you should own more than one-third of the company in exchange for your sweat equity.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>You work for a small business in exchange for ownership shares<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>In this particular situation, perhaps you have perhaps recently started doing project work at a startup in addition to your day job. With limited funds, the company offered you ownership shares in exchange for your skills and work. You may have a smaller stake than the founders of the company, but if you start spending more hours at the business, you can always ask for more shares.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>You think that it might help you get funding<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve funneled all your available cash into your small business, it may be time to take out a small business loan. Before you do this, however, it&#8217;s important to understand that a prospective lender will generally look at the financial qualifications of all owners with more than a 20% share in the company. Along with this, the lender will typically look at all of the owners&#8217; credit scores.</p>
<p>For many loans offering lower interest rates, you&#8217;ll need to have a credit scores of 620 or higher. This means that if you meet this threshold and your small business partners don&#8217;t, you may think it&#8217;s a good idea to change ownership shares so that only your credit is examined. However, you may want to think again. Changing ownership percentages just to qualify for a better loan isn&#8217;t always a wise move, especially if your capital investment or sweat equity in the company is exactly the same as it was before starting the loan process, says Anna Dodson, a partner at Goodwin Procter LLP.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to consider another form of funding: <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invoice financing.</a> With invoice financing, you get cash advances on your unpaid invoices. This can improve your company&#8217;s cash flow, manage your expenses and augment your working capital without worrying about needing to change ownership shares just to qualify for a decent loan. With invoice financing, you also won&#8217;t have to go through a lengthy loan approval process or worry about your credit score in order to get funding.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get started with invoice financing through <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a>. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><strong>Register for free.<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>You’ll need your business name and business email to register.</li>
<li>
<h4><strong>Click to connect your bookkeeping app.<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>Fundbox supports a number of different accounting platforms. By integrating with your accounting software, Fundbox&#8217;s technology assesses your small business and determines if we are able to offer Fundbox Credit—no personal credit pull needed to get started. If approved, you could qualify for up to $100,000 in Fundbox Credit<sup>TM</sup>.</li>
<li>
<h4><strong>Choose which invoices you want to advance.</strong></h4>
<p>Your available invoices will appear in your Fundbox dashboard. Select the unpaid invoices you want to advance with the click of the mouse or a tap of the finger. Unlike traditional factoring, you have the control to choose precisely which invoice to advance.</li>
<li>
<h4><strong>Start spending your cash.<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>The full value of the invoice—100%—will be sent to your business bank account in as soon as the next business day.</li>
<li>
<h4><strong>Repay the advance over the next 12 or 24 weeks.<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>Depending on your preference, you can choose between 12 or 24-week repayment terms. Fundbox automatically debits a portion of the amount advanced, plus a small fee, each week. You&#8217;ll see both the weekly and total fees before you confirm the advance. Best of all, you can repay early without any early repayment fees—and all remaining fees will be waived.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="513" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_596409677-768x513.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="cash flow" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_596409677-768x513.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_596409677.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>As a small business owner, using your business credit or debit card for daily coffee runs or dining out is something you may feel entitled to. Let&#8217;s be real: You worked hard to launch your business, and it&#8217;s perfectly legal to write off these types of expenditures on your business taxes. You probably don&#8217;t expect it to affect your business&#8217;s cash flow statement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, lunches at the local taqueria, iced mochas, and other non-essential expenses are not mission-critical to the survival of your business. If you don&#8217;t watch it, those daily runs for $10 designer burritos can add up and eventually negatively impact your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/your-small-business-needs-a-cash-flow-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow statement</a>. While this may not seem important at the time, keeping an eye on your extraneous expenses will help you generate more cash than you spend, leading to a positive cash flow statement. This, in turn, means you&#8217;ll have more money available to pay your bills, cover your overhead, and invest in your future growth.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can I Improve My Cash Flow Statement?</strong></h2>
<p>If you must have your daily burritos, you might want to consider transferring a set monthly amount from your business checking account to your personal bank account. This way, you can use funds from your personal bank account to buy lunches while keeping a more realistic pulse on your business <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/common-issues-affecting-cash-flow-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a>. If you find it challenging to separate your business and personal expenses or can&#8217;t easily kick your burrito habit, take a look at our top four tips for improving your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-small-business-secrets-to-improving-cash-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a> statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Create and stick to a budget<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Your budget should take into account all of your business costs, including big-ticket items like a lease and payroll as well as smaller expenses like dining out. Figure out how much money you&#8217;ll need to cover your essential business expenses and then come up with a reasonable amount to spend on non-essential costs. Most importantly, stick to your budget.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Check your business bank account daily<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>By doing this, you&#8217;ll get a real sense of how much money you have—which means you can make a concerted effort to stick to your budget and only spend money when you have the available cash. This is especially important as spending money when you don&#8217;t have it can be a costly mistake. For example, if you buy that $10 burrito with non-sufficient funds (NSFs), you could end up with a $40 overcharge fee, bringing the cost of that burrito up to $50.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Take a long-term view<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>When you have a small business and money is flowing in, it&#8217;s easy to live in the moment and spend your cash frivolously while you&#8217;ve got it. However, things can change, and next year, you may want to hire a new employee or lease more office space. For this reason, it&#8217;s a good idea to create a cash flow cushion so that you can cover any planned or unexpected major costs while still paying for your daily expenses and overhead.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Make sure you keep the cash flowing<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>To help your company stay cash-flow positive, it&#8217;s important that your clients pay their bills on time. This isn&#8217;t always so easy, which is why you may want to consider working with an invoice financing company like <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a>. By using Fundbox to clear your unpaid invoices with immediate advances, you can better maintain a predictable and strong cash flow statement. To get started, all you need to do is set up a Fundbox account, select your bookkeeping app and choose the invoices that you would like to pay. Fundbox advances the full value of your invoices to your bank account. You&#8217;ll then repay Fundbox by making 12 or 24 weekly payments, including a small fee. In the meantime, while you wait for your clients to pay their invoices, you can use the cash generated by the Fundbox invoice advances to help cover your overhead and other daily costs—or even use it to fund faster growth!</li>

This is where accurate accounting with help from  bookkeeping apps can help you get a handle on your finances.</p>
<p>Although there are many bookkeeping platforms available, there are also a multitude of accounting tools and bookkeeping apps that target small business owners and freelancers. By using a bookkeeping app, you can monitor your cash flow, keep track of expenses, pay bills, send invoices to your clients, and more—<a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-apps-tools-manage-your-cash-flow/" target="_blank">on the fly and from your phone</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Bookkeeping Apps to Help You Manage Your Cash Flow</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.waveapps.com/" target="_blank">Wave</a></strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to free and simple bookkeeping, it&#8217;s time to ride this Wave. You can create a Wave account in under a minute. Called &#8220;real accounting for non-accountants,&#8221; Wave allows you to create and send invoices, generate financial reports, track expenses, and link directly to your business bank account. You can even use the Wave app to send invoices from your phone and accept credit card payment (for this service, you&#8217;ll pay a typical credit card transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents.)</li>
<li>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.kashoo.com/home" target="_blank">Kashoo</a></strong></h3>
<p>Built for small businesses by a team that claims to have a working knowledge of how small businesses function, Kashoo is a simple accounting tool and app designed for busy entrepreneurs. Kashoo&#8217;s software lets you control your bookkeeping needs from one simple and organized place.

<li>
<h3><strong><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank">Quickbooks</a></strong></h3>
<p>Intuit&#8217;s Quickbooks offers an immersive way for freelancers and small businesses to manage their cash flow, invoicing, billing, and even taxes. With many different price points and packages available, the “self-employed” plan is perhaps the best option for independent contractors who want an immersive accounting platform for an affordable price. At only $5 a month for new customers (regularly $10/month), you can <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/self-employed/" target="_blank">generate and send invoices</a> and also get paid by credit card bank transfer (to accept payments, you&#8217;ll have to pay a small fee.) The self-employed package also lets you track and itemize business expenses as well as monitor your automobile mileage.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/" target="_blank">FreshBooks</a></strong></h3>
<p>This cloud accounting system is a great option for small business owners and independent contractors who want an all-in-one option for managing their bookkeeping tasks, including invoicing, sending late payment reminders, tracking time, managing expenses, and viewing financial reports. According to the company, the average FreshBooks customer <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/self-employed" target="_blank">saves over 16 hours a month</a> by using its platform to eliminate the hassle of creating invoices and collecting payments. Costs start at $15 a month, and you can also give FreshBooks <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/pricing" target="_blank">a free test drive </a>for your first 30 days.</li>
</ol>
<p>While comparing bookkeeping apps, there&#8217;s another function that all of these tools on our list share: They all help you get paid fast with <a href="https://fundbox.com?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=4-bookkeeping-apps-cash-flow" target="_blank">invoice financing</a>. By integrating your bookkeeping tool with <a href="https://fundbox.com?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=4-bookkeeping-apps-cash-flow" target="_blank">Fundbox</a>, you don&#8217;t have to wait 30, 60, or sometimes 90 days to get paid on your invoices. Here are the basic steps to help you get started <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/new-business-invoice-financing-help-cash-flow/" target="_blank">with invoice financing</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a free Fundbox account and select a bookkeeping app from a list of partners (which include the four apps listed here).</li>
<li>Once approved, choose the invoice you want to clear.</li>
<li>Fundbox transfers the amount of that invoice to your bank account in as soon as one business day.</li>
<li>Repay Fundbox via weekly payments over either a 12 or 24-week time frame.</li>
</ul>

However, before you get too relaxed, it&#8217;s time to start your marketing preparations around the next holiday: Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day is big business, even for small businesses. While only about 55% of Americans celebrate the day of love, those who did celebrate last year spent an average of $146.84, according to the National Retail Federation. All told, Valentine&#8217;s Day spending hit about $19.7 billion in 2016, <a href="http://time.com/money/4213074/valentines-day-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Money Magazine</a>. That large holiday payout, however, happens rather quickly. In fact, <a href="http://business.time.com/2012/02/09/valentines-day-2012-spending-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Time Magazine,</a> 60% of all Valentine&#8217;s Day spending occurs on February 14 and in the five days leading up to it.</p>
<p>This may be good news for you, as this means it&#8217;s not too late to create themed promotions around Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Valentine&#8217;s Day Marketing Tips</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get social</strong></h3>
<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day is a perfect hook for social media promotions that reward your customers for telling others what they love about your business. You can start with a special promotion on Facebook and Twitter that runs through Valentine&#8217;s Day. For example, you can ask your customers on social media to post or tweet their favorite service or purchased product in order to receive a special discount. Or you can hold a social media contest and ask your customers to post what they love the most about your business, services, or products. Perhaps the prize is a full year of savings on products or a free month of services. On Valentine&#8217;s Day, you can announce the winner with a photo or repost of that client&#8217;s love story about your business.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Create special discount coupons<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>During the month of February, you can show your customers that you care by sending out a Valentine&#8217;s Day-themed email blast which includes a special offer, such as a discount on their next purchase, 50% off a particular service during the month, or a buy-one-get-one free deal. You can include this special cupid promotion in the body of your email or attach a coupon that your clients can redeem in person or online. Since your e-blast will generally go out to existing customers or at least those who have provided you with their email addresses, you can also ask those your clients to share the deal by forwarding it to their friends.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Share the love<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Along with Valentine&#8217;s Day hearts, February also marks American Heart Month. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Americans, and the upcoming heart month encourages Americans to become more aware of eating healthy and exercising to <a href="http://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve cardiovascular health</a>. Tied in to American Heart Month is the American Heart Association&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go Red For Women campaign</a>, marked by National Wear Red Day on February 3. If your business wants to align with heart-healthy causes, you might consider holding a Valentine&#8217;s Day special event or promotion where a portion of your proceeds or sales from a particular day would be donated to your local chapter of the American Heart Association or another heart healthy charity of your choice. Even if you don&#8217;t end up raking in much money, sharing the love with a great cause is <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/tips-generate-media-coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">positive publicity </a>for your small business and often leads to increased sales down the line.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Sweeten the pot<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone loves hearts and chocolate, and Valentine&#8217;s Day is a great excuse to give away a little of both. This type of promotion won&#8217;t cost you much and you will likely reap the rewards in higher sales as your customers will remember the sweet sentiment. Some ideas include leaving a dish of heart-shaped candies on your desk to give out to clients or keeping a stash of Hershey&#8217;s Kisses near your cash register to dole out to your retail customers. You may also want to put together bags filled with assorted pink candy. Lastly, if you can pull it together in time, pink and red <a href="https://www.mymms.com/home.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized M&amp;Ms </a>with your company logo are inventive and will make a lasting impression on your clients.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_409298560-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="invoice financing" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_409298560-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_409298560.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Have you heard of invoice financing? If you&#8217;re a freelance writer, you know how difficult it is to <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/new-business-invoice-financing-help-cash-flow?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=invoice-financing-jumpstart-freelance-writing-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>manage your cash flow</strong></a>. Perhaps you left a full-time job to go out on your own, leaving behind a steady paycheck and benefits. Or, maybe you&#8217;re trying to build your writing business on the side so that you can eventually become a full-time freelancer.</p>
<p>Regardless of your particular situation, you&#8217;re likely getting used to sending invoices to your clients and then waiting to get paid—sometimes for up to three months. Although you may work from home with no employees to worry about, you still have to pay your mortgage or rent, buy groceries, and cover a myriad of other costs. You may also have business overhead such as marketing fees, an accountant to pay, office supplies to purchase, and other expenses. Mounting bills coupled with unsteady cash flow is enough to make many freelance writers give up their newfound independence and go back to a full-time job.</p>
<p>However, there is a way to solve your cash flow dilemma: <a href="https://fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=invoice-financing-jumpstart-freelance-writing-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invoice financing</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is invoice financing?</strong></h2>
<p>Invoice financing <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=invoice-financing-jumpstart-freelance-writing-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a type of funding whereby you receive advances for your unpaid invoices.</a> That&#8217;s right. If you are tired of waiting for 30, 60, or 90 days to get paid by the publications and companies you write for, invoice financing may be a perfect solution for your freelance business. It&#8217;s different than a conventional loan in that you don&#8217;t borrow a specific amount of money that you then have to pay back plus interest. Instead, you can use invoice financing to advance you the funds to cover the exact amounts of specific invoices. For example, if you know one of your clients always takes at least 60 days to pay you, you can request advances on just the invoices that you have sent to this one client.</p>
<p>Invoice financing also gives you access to your much-needed cash fast—typically by the next business day. This way, you can pay your bills and better manage your cash flow.</p>
<h2><strong>How do I start using invoice financing?</strong></h2>
<p>If invoice financing sounds like a good solution for you, your next question may be: How do I tap into this for my freelance business and start getting paid for my outstanding invoices?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be glad to know that some companies, like <a href="https://fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=invoice-financing-jumpstart-freelance-writing-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox,</a> make it simple for you to start right now. Here&#8217;s how it works in three simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Set up a Fundbox account.</strong></h3>
<p>You can sign up <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=invoice-financing-jumpstart-freelance-writing-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a> by entering your email address, selecting a password, and designating your bookkeeping app.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Begin clearing your invoices.<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Simply click on any of your outstanding invoices, and the amount will be sent to your bank account as quickly as the next day. You then pay back Fundbox for the total invoice value, plus a flat You can choose to make weekly payments stretched out over 12 or 24 weeks.</p>
<p>For a $1,000 invoice, for example, your weekly payment would be about $89 a week if you choose to repay over 12 weeks ($83 for the invoice value, and roughly $6 in fees.) If you&#8217;d prefer to repay over 24 weeks, your payments will be about $48 a week ($42 of invoice value plus about $6 in fees). Fees may vary, but you&#8217;ll always have access to your fee and weekly payment in the Fundbox dashboard before you clear any invoices.</p>
<p>Another big perk: If you have the available funds to pay back those invoice advances early, you can do this without penalties. For example, if you pay back an invoice in full on week 6 instead of making all 12 payments, you&#8217;ll only pay fees for weeks 1–6. The fees for weeks 7–12 will be waived completely.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Live your life. Grow your freelance business.<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you can rely on a steady cash flow, you can pay your bills, invest in marketing your writing services, and enjoy your freelance career.</li>
</ol>
<p>A final note: Most freelance writers dread sending emails or making phone calls to clients to ask for payment. With invoice financing, these collection calls may be a thing of the past as you won&#8217;t have to worry about waiting to get paid. In most cases, the check will roll in eventually. Meanwhile, you can relax knowing that you already have the funds to cover those invoices in your bank account.</p>
