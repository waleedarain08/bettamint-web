<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re talking about</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to Know Your Customers Day</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a quarterly event recognized on the 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of each January, April, July and October. Consider it an opportunity to not only get to know your customers better but to also think about how you can enhance the customer service experience overall. The outcome? How does repeat business and the development of a strong customer base sound (</span><a href="https://khoros.com/blog/must-know-customer-service-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">because data indicates that this will be the result</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways you can enhance customer experience (with the ultimate goal of winning new customers and solidifying relationships with existing ones) on Get To Know Your Customers Day, and all the days that follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be strategic about free consultations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In service-based businesses, free consultations sometimes seem par for the course. Unfortunately, free consultations often fail to convert prospects into clients because the consultations are nothing more than thinly veiled sales pitches. If you run the type of small business known for offering free consultations—like a hair salon, a personal training studio, a photography business or a tax preparation firm, for example—and you choose to offer them,</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/win-new-customers-with-free-consultations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">make sure that you are conducting each consultation in manner that leaves your prospect with a positive impression of your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One way to do this is to focus on getting to know the customer during the consultation rather than just telling them about all the goods and services you have to offer. This way, potential clients will know you truly committed to serving their needs rather than just getting them to swipe their credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep customers in the loop</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you changing your hours? Re-evaluating your COVID-19 protocols? Eliminating or adding services? This is certainly your prerogative as a business owner, but you need to make sure your customers (and potential customers) know what’s up so they aren’t caught off guard. Imagine how frustrated they’ll feel when they show up at your door and find the place all locked up (on a day you are normally open for business).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t have to happen, though—customer experience is greatly enhanced by the simple act of keeping people updated on your hours, policies, procedures and offerings. All you have to do is regularly log on to your website to update pertinent information, edit your business listing on Google, post updates on social media, distribute the information via email to customers, etc. Your time investment is minimal, but the payoff is tremendous due to the fact you are eliminating the risk of losing a potential customer over them receiving outdated information about your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to feedback from newer and loyal customers alike</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soliciting feedback is the first step—and you can do this in a variety of ways, like surveys, questionnaires or asking them directly about their experience—but the important part is to really take that feedback to heart. If someone expresses concern about a customer service encounter, for example, make sure that customer knows that you are committed to making it right. If the customer survey you send out reveals a pattern of behavior among staff members that needs to be addressed, address it. If your online reviews leave something to be desired, investigate and make changes as needed. Most importantly, thank your customers for sharing their thoughts with you so they know their voices have been heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive feedback is worth acknowledging, as well. First and foremost, it never hurts to say ‘thanks’ when a customer gives you a five-star review. Also, keep in mind that if customers say they appreciate something they may want more of the same. Whatever it is, continue to provide it to them and their customer experience is bound to be enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer incentives to loyal customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-established, larger companies often have the resources to set up attractive loyalty programs, and statistics indicate that customers love them—according to the</span><a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/352767/TLR%20Library/Bond%20Loyalty%20Report%202020_US%20ExecSummary.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Bond Brand Loyalty Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 78% of folks surveyed say they are more likely to continue doing business with brands that have loyalty or reward programs (and 72% are more likely to recommend brands with loyalty programs to friends).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business owners can get in on this, too. Even if your resources don’t allow you to put together a multi-tiered program with all the bells and whistles, you can still reward loyal customers in other ways. Simple incentives like gifts, freebies, discounts and special insider deals can go a long way toward enhancing the customer relationship with your loyal patrons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay attention to social media analytics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to use social media to engage with existing and potential customers (and data suggests this is a good idea,</span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/226029/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2019-of-population"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">especially if you are targeting Millennials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Zers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), posting regularly and learning the ins-and-outs of the individual platforms is important and beneficial—but don’t stop there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the major social media platforms, from Instagram and Facebook to TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn and Snapchat, provide usage analytics to small business owners. In order to really get to know your customers (and grow business, to boot), consider taking the time to study these analytics—they provide valuable details about the demographics of your social media audience, as well as information about how certain posts are performing, how many people are clicking through to your website and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have this information, you can use it to more effectively reach the folks most likely to interact with you on social media. Rather than just posting updates randomly, for example, you’ll have insight as to the types of posts most likely to appeal to active users, and you’ll know when these active users are logging on to your page. As an added bonus, through the process of elimination you’ll also learn which demographic is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responding to your social media posts so you can find alternative ways to get to know them better.</span></p>

You also need to</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-retain-millennial-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">retain these employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you fail to keep them around, you might find yourself in a vicious cycle of hire-train-repeat (an endeavor that can be costly, time-consuming and aggravating).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things you, as a small business owner, can do to avoid this vicious cycle is to help your employees stay motivated. Not only are motivated employees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees, they are also less likely to say “I quit” in response to on-the-job challenges and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely to consistently produce high-quality work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, exactly, does it take to motivate? It really all comes down to a few enduring motivational techniques. Here are five reliable ways to motivate the people who work for your small business so that they, in turn, will give your business the best that they’ve got.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Provide freedom and flexibility to your team members</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your team is remote or working on site, the level of motivation among individual employees is bound to be higher if they don’t feel trapped by a micromanaging boss who demands a detailed account of how they spend their time each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than concerning yourself with how many hours people are spending in front of their computers, allow them to structure their workweeks as they see fit. Does someone need to leave at 3pm to take a child to soccer practice, or put in a few extra hours on Wednesday and Thursday so they can take Friday afternoon off to tend to a personal matter (the scenarios are endless, but you catch the drift)? No problem, so long as they are holding up their end of the bargain (i.e. getting all of their work done on time). They’ll appreciate the autonomy and, in return, are that much more likely to spend their working hours in a state of focus rather than a state of clock watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service-oriented businesses may find this concept less feasible, considering you can’t exactly allow retail employees or receptionists to come and go as they please. However, that does not make this motivational technique null and void for such businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider letting employees request the days and hours they want to work rather than simply assigning shifts and time slots. Let them choose when they take their breaks. Be gracious if they need to make changes (even if those changes are sometimes last minute, because emergencies happen) and make sure they know whom to notify or talk to about needs related to their scheduled work hours.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Trust your employees to do their jobs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the same lines as providing freedom and flexibility, trusting them to do their jobs is a key piece of the motivational puzzle. Assuming you made great hires, they probably don’t need an overseer keeping tabs on them or telling them how to complete their work. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t provide tools and training when tools and training are needed (you should!). It simply means your employees will feel more motivated to do great work if they believe that their boss considers them capable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practically speaking, one way to let your employees know that you trust them is to avoid looking over their shoulders all the time, demanding that they follow your processes and methodologies. Instead, concern yourself with the final product,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">assuming that whatever processes and methodologies they choose (within reason, of course) will lead to the results you want. As long as expectations are clearly communicated, a positive outcome is probable.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Show appreciation and recognize achievements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By showing appreciation, we are not referring to a quick ‘thx’ text message sent in response to “the report will be delivered by 5pm.” We’re talking about those small but tangible things you can do to truly make your employees feel valued, like treating them to coffee, offering an extra personal day, sending flowers on their birthday, or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating employee appreciation day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The options are endless and they don’t have to be grandiose. All they have to be is genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re at it, take note of the fact that employees are also highly motivated by receiving recognition for a job well done. Did someone knock that presentation out of the park? Win over a tough-as-nails client? Solve a stubborn technology problem? Let them know you noticed. Whether that involves something as basic walking over to their desk and telling them you how much you appreciate their hard work or something as major as giving them a promotion and a raise is up to you, but the fact of the matter is you are more likely to see results like this again and again when their achievements are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledged</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again and again.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Give employees jobs that matches their interests and skills</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you hire a new employee and they inadvertently wind up doing tasks that aren’t listed in their official job description (which they may or may not appreciate). Sometimes, time reveals that your sales assistant’s skills are more on par with a sales </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manager</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role or that your customer relations coordinator, despite a rock-solid work ethic, isn’t a good fit for a job that involves direct communication with customers. Regardless of the specifics, keeping someone in a job that doesn’t suit them, or one they have outgrown, is a surefire way to destroy motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remedy? Make sure all of your employees are in the right roles. Promote when the time is right, reassign people to other jobs when necessary and listen to what your employees are saying about their ideas and work-related goals. The other option, letting people languish in positions that aren&#8217;t right for them, is pretty much a guarantee that you’ll either lose good employers to other jobs or have a team full of discontented folks who are constantly counting down the minutes to the weekend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Compensate your employees fairly</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Seattle business owner made headlines several years ago when he decided to phase in a $70K per year minimum wage for all employees, something that led to a significant salary increase for many of them (he cut his own salary from $1.1 million </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $70K to help fund the new pay scale). Evidently, this action resulted in higher levels of productivity and job satisfaction, across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, of course, is an extreme case (few small business owners have the budget to establish this sort of compensation program). However, the reported success of this program makes the point that employees are often more motivated to do good work if they feel they are being paid fairly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make this a reality among your employees by staying on top of your industry’s salary trends and making sure the compensation you offer is in range (because underpaid employees are bound to lose motivation, sooner rather than later).</span></p>

You’ve even created—and deployed—</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a robust marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are using a whole host of proven B2B marketing tactics in your quest to turn promising leads into loyal clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge? Competition is fierce, so sticking to basic marketing tactics isn’t always enough. If the goal is to generate more B2B sales among new and existing clients, it may be time to harness some of that same creative energy you used to revolutionize your industry’s offerings in the first place to take your small business’s marketing strategy to the next level (thanks to the pandemic, you may be planning to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update your overall digital marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anyway—so the time to do think specifically about B2B marketing has never been better).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are four innovative B2B marketing strategies your small business can use now to build client relationships, increase sales, and stand out in the crowd. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customize the client experience with augmented reality </span><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, with a large portion of the workforce conducting business at home rather than in an office, it is harder and harder to get your products in front of would-be clients so they can actually see and experience the benefits firsthand before making a purchase. The antidote to this? It&#8217;s an interactive technology called </span><a href="https://www.fi.edu/what-is-augmented-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike virtual reality, which places the user in a virtual environment, AR places a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">user’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environment. This allows said user to visualize, in detail, how the product might appear/function within their own workspace before they actually make the purchase. Picture a coffee shop owner, for example, “trying out” a new espresso machine virtually as a way to determine whether it actually fits in the allotted space, or a business manager doing the same with a multifunction copy machine. If your business is one that offers product customization, AR allows you to customize virtually so clients can see what something might look like with these customizations before making a commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An almost </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 billion (and growing) global industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AR is conducted with a smartphone or tablet camera, in conjunction with a web browser and special AR software. The downside to AR? The cost to implement the technology varies significantly based on whether you build your AR tools in-house using a DIY app or hire a pro to design custom software—so be aware that it may be cost-prohibitive for some small businesses, depending on needs and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>AR is one of several</i> </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective marketing tools for B2C ecommerce businesses</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. If you’ve ever shopped for a car online or visited a virtual dressing room to try on jeans, you’ve probably seen it.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiment with long-form content</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you’ve heard that blog content is supposed to be short, punchy and straight to the point. While this may have been true at one time, research actually indicates that long-form content </span><a href="https://www.semrush.com/ebooks/state-of-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets shared three times more than short-form content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to earn a first-page ranking on Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask, what does this have to do with innovation? Despite these stats, long-form content hasn’t really caught on yet in the B2B world. As of 2020, only </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38% of marketers in the B2B space were using it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Content Marketing Institute. You’ll be ahead of the curve if you start incorporating long-form content into your content marketing plan now, before it becomes commonplace.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of content can be long-form?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-form content is characterized primarily by length. CMI defines it as </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2020/04/long-form-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any piece of content in the 2-3K word range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (anything above and beyond that is considered “extra-long”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of long-form marketing content include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case studies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White papers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-books</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guides/tutorials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillar pages (in-depth and lengthy, with lots of links to related content) </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equip your website with real-time personalization</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200311005240/en/Folloze-Research-B2B-Marketing-Sales-Teams-Link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 survey of B2B sales and marketing professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that more than half of respondents believe personalization in marketing leads to “higher conversion rates.” At the same time, a considerable portion of them (42%) reported struggling to incorporate personalization into their B2B marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the struggling-to-incorporate camp, now may be the time to really dive into the process of figuring out how to use personalization in your B2B marketing strategy because, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2019 report by McKinsey and Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is expected to be the “prime deliverer of marketing success” by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One innovative way to make this happen? Through the use of automated tools that customize your website content for each unique set of visitors, otherwise known as real-time personalization (this is just one of many types of personalization in B2B marketing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, with real-time personalization, your website uses IP addresses, locations and domains to instinctively recognize where various visitors are coming from. Then, it shows these visitors text and images that are most relevant to their businesses (in the form of products, informational blog posts, event announcements, etc.) while simultaneously weeding out content that is less likely to pique their interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may sound complicated and expensive, you’re in luck—it doesn’t have to be. Many automated personalization tools, such as</span><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize-360/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Optimize 360</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are competitively priced or, in some cases, even free. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a podcast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week, </span><a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68 million Americans listen to podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While comedy is the most popular genre (no surprise there), plenty of people are interested in listening to informative business and educational podcasts, hosted and/or created by leaders in their respective fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this adds up to an enormous and potentially game-changing opportunity for you as a small business owner. For one thing, while podcasts are certainly growing in popularity, the market is nowhere near saturated—especially in niche areas like B2B (</span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/why-podcasting-matters-to-marketing-infographic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to one source, collectively a mere 3% of marketing pros were podcasting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of March 2020).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasting is also:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple to navigate, with fewer constraints on access compared to some other media channels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable (you can create a podcast without a large financial investment)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to establish credibility as a subject matter expert in your field</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450637/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for branding and relationship-building purposes</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A way to generate ad revenue</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to discuss on a B2B podcast? Keep in mind that podcasting is really just an extension of your existing content marketing efforts, so refer to your existing content for inspiration. You can also interview important figures in your field, share company news, discuss the history of your business&#8217;s niche, really anything at all that your clients (and potential clients) might enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Did you know</i> </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox produces a podcast</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics indicate that business owners are taking advantage of Instagram’s clout—</span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of businesses use Instagram to at least some degree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Perhaps more importantly, </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of Instagram </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">users</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning consumers with personal Instagram accounts) turn to the platform for information on products and services before making a purchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes everything from doing research on products and services to getting the particulars on promotions and sales to finding links to websites and contact information. All add up to a potential goldmine for small business owners interested in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updating their digital marketing campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proven e-commerce strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply being on Instagram (e.g. signing up for an </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram business account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) isn’t going to get you very far, though. You need to actually use it in a way that will pay off. How can you do this? Multiple factors are involved, but one of the most important factors involves your followers. Not only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is following you (although that can be important, too), but how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are following you as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does it matter? That’s because followers beget </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">followers, along with more shares, more visibility and ultimately (hopefully!) more sales. Learning how to gather followers isn’t necessarily instinctive, but once you know the ropes it will feel like second nature. Do you have just a handful of followers, or are you working with a sizable list of actively engaged folks who regularly view your posts?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is the former, here are four actions you can take now to increase the number of your small business’s Instagram followers:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Use hashtags strategically and effectively</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hashtag may appear to be nothing other than a random word or phrase with a pound sign in front of it. In reality, hashtags are your business’s best friend—at least in terms of getting an influx of Instagram followers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the purpose of hashtags?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashtags provide a chance to connect your business to a cause relevant to your brand, a promotional opportunity or a trending topic by catapulting a post into the search results related to said hashtags so your business is easier to find (the sheer volume of content on Instagram means a lot of great posts get buried without them). When an Instagram user enters a search term preceded by a hashtag into the search field, posts that include that hashtag will appear (coffee connoisseurs may search for #espresso, whereas someone planning a vacation may search for #travel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you can research hashtags that apply to your business and include them in your Instagram posts to increase the potential for views, likes and additional followers (examples include hashtags like #nationalsmallbusinessweek or #smallbusiness). You can also create custom hashtags for special events (like a seasonal sale), and advise customers to search for and follow those hashtags on Instagram.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many hashtags should you use?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of hashtags you use in a post is all up to you, and that decision will depend greatly on the hashtag protocols in your industry. Instagram’s hashtag limit is 30 per post. You certainly don’t need to take it that far if you don’t want to, but you may want to consider using at least one—</span><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/instagram-stats-every-marketer-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data supports the idea that posts with hashtags receive more consumer engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than those without. The sweet spot? Around five hashtags per post.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: To help establish brand recognition, create a hashtag specific to your business name and/or brand and encourage followers to use it when mentioning your business in posts.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Invest in Instagram ads</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never considered capitalizing on the power of </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now may be the time to give it a try if one of your objectives is to gain more followers. Often more affordable than traditional forms of advertising, like radio or print, Instagram offers a lot of flexibility in terms of how you format your ad. You can take an existing post and morph it into an ad, you can produce ads in Instagram Stories, you can create shoppable posts and so on. </span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/how-much-does-social-media-advertising-cost.html#instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost to you, as the advertiser, is click- or impression-based and varies a lot depending on several factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do ads help increase your follower count? Instagram uses algorithms and data to target folks who show interest in products or services like yours, even if they aren’t already following you. As they scroll, your ad appears. Not all will follow you but, thanks to targeting, some probably will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Tip: Another advertising option?</i> </span><a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-sponsored-posts/#:~:text=An%20Instagram%20sponsored%20post%20is,account%20for%20a%20lucrative%20career." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored posts</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This involves partnering with (i.e. paying) an influencer to promote your products or services in their own posts or stories. Because their followers presumably consider them a credible source, their endorsement may result in more followers for you.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Host contests and giveaways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram users love contests and giveaways and, as a small business with an Instagram business account, it may be worth your time to sponsor one. Why? Because a contest/giveaway provides an opportunity to quickly and easily gain followers. Contests and giveaways also allow you to engage with your current followers in a way that encourages them to help you spread the word about your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting one up isn’t hard. It all starts with determining what it is you want to give away and setting contest parameters (be aware that </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/179379842258600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram has several rules about contests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you’ll need to adhere to). Since your goal is to gain followers, however, you’ll want to make sure that those parameters help get you there.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few ideas:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage followers to tag a friend for an additional contest entry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the contest open to followers only.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborate on the contest with another business or influence (cross promotion for the win). </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Engage with followers (and potential followers)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you do this yourself, maybe you hire a social media manager to do it or maybe you assign the task to an employee. In any case, one of the best ways to increase your Instagram following is to actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram as the communication tool that it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This starts, of course, with posting regularly, but it doesn’t end there. You also need to make sure your followers know you actually see and hear them. How?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reply to their comments, questions and concerns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone tags your business in a post, thank them in the comments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow them back—especially those that like and/or comment on your posts regularly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comment on other users’ posts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regram” (i.e. share) posts that you think may interest your followers (unlike Facebook and other social media apps, Instagram doesn’t make this easy—</span><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/how-to-repost-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll need to use a third-party app or take a screenshot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to share another account’s post).</span></li>

Although this ongoing global calamity will eventually become a part of history, it won’t be the last crisis we experience (individually or collectively). That’s why, just as you protect your health by getting a vaccine and wearing a mask, it is important to protect your financial security by learning how to best manage your money throughout a crisis situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These personal finance rules apply to everyone, whether you are gainfully employed, struggling to keep the doors of your small business open amid capacity restrictions and decreased customer traffic, or even</span> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">among the 9.7 million Americans who were unemployed as of March 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are seven money management tips to help see you through the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis, and any other crisis that may come along in the future (and let’s face it, some of this financial advice holds true any time, crisis or not).</span></p>
<h2>1. Stick to your budget (and refine it if necessary)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve heard over and over again that you need to create a budget. And for good reason—when managed properly, a budget works wonders (because it allows you to take control of your money rather than allowing your money to control you). When you are in crisis mode, however, stress and shifting expenses can make it tough to stick to this budget (even if you were great about it before). Resist the urge to let your budgeting practice go during the worst of times. If you do, you could find yourself dealing with yet another financial fallout when the crisis that led you to abandon your tried-and-true budgeting practice finally subsides.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New to budgeting? Just like</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are numerous tools to help you create a budget for your small business</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are also a variety of templates and programs out there to help you figure out how to keep your own budget in check. The best one is relative, but guiding principles include allocating enough money from each paycheck to cover all your fixed monthly expenses (mortgage, utilities, insurance, etc.), figuring how much you need each month to cover groceries, gasoline and incidentals, prioritizing savings and paying off debt.</span></i></p>
<h2>2. Save/plan for big expenditures</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/capital-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you know you may not want to dip into your working capital to pay for expensive equipment or to fund the construction of a new facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The same theory applies to your personal finances, especially during times of crisis. Yes, it is OK—and perhaps even smart, considering the fact that </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/explore-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interest rates are so low</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—to buy a new house, upgrade your dishwasher or replace an aging vehicle during a time of crisis, but it might not be a good idea to upset your cashflow to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, set aside specific funds to cover the costs in question. Maybe that simply means allocating a certain amount of money each month in a “dishwasher fund” or waiting to buy that new house until you have a larger down payment in hand. Either way, think twice about haphazardly putting what is supposed to be your grocery money toward a payment on a newer/more expensive car.</span></p>
<h2>3. Analyze your expenditures</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because something is in your budget doesn’t mean it has to stay in your budget. Are you actually using all of those apps and streaming services? Do you really need that monthly subscription box? Can you still afford to pay to have your house professionally cleaned twice a month? If the answer is no, press pause on these items. You can always start up again when times aren’t so uncertain.  </span></p>
<h2>4. Seek help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the nature of the crisis (health, personal, business, etc.), programs exist to help people with their financial obligations during troubling times. Often, all you have to do is ask. Offerings range from the most basic, like food boxes distributed through schools, community organizations and places of worship, to more formal types of aid, like (COVID-19 specific) </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government assistance programs for small businesses owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also ask your utility companies and other service providers for extensions, or you can </span><a href="https://www.usa.gov/help-with-bills#:~:text=The%20Low%20Income%20Home%20Energy,your%20heating%20or%20cooling%20bills&amp;text=Low%2Dcost%20home%20improvements%2C%20known,and%20lower%20your%20utility%20bills." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for aid if you need it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it is a medical crisis you are attempting to navigate, ask your provider’s social worker about help as well—many hospitals partner with nonprofit organizations to provide financial support to patients in need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While asking for financial assistance isn’t always easy, it can go a long way toward successful money management during a crisis because help in one category allows you to reallocate funds to a more critical budgetary category if needed.</span></p>
<h2>5. Keep an eye on your credit card spending</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash back rewards are nice, but not if you are paying interest on the purchases that allowed you to earn those rewards. While it is not usually a good idea to use a credit card to pay for things you can’t afford, it is especially problematic during a crisis because the stress of the crisis situation could result in the charges getting out of hand (be sure to pay your bill on time, too, because late payments will eventually impact your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2>6. Be fastidious about how you use your stimulus payments</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can use your check to buy a new TV or to treat your family to a weekend getaway. But before you do that, consider whether that is the best use of the funds. Do you have outstanding debt, or do you need cash to fund your kids’ extracurricular activities? Is your emergency fund non-existent? If so, you might want to consider putting at least a portion of your stimulus toward those practical items so you are not scrambling to cover the costs later.</span></p>
<h2>7. Remember that your emergency fund is there to help you in a crisis situation.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of emergency funds, when you’ve worked hard to put money away in a savings account, it can be distressing to use that money (even when you really need it). However, the whole point of an emergency fund is to carry you through a time of crisis or to cover the cost of an unexpected expense, so you should consider all options available to you.If you’re thinking about dipping into your emergency fund, it may be helpful to plan out how you can rebuild the fund (with at least three- to six-months of living expenses) when your financial outlook improves.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_443955802-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Casual businessman holding a document kneels on the floor over a Content Marketing diagram" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_443955802-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/shutterstock_443955802.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a professionally-designed website with the contact information for your local business prominently displayed on your home page. So, why is your main competitor’s page getting all the hits while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website struggles to make it to the top of page three on Google? Are they just lucky?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at all. Search engine results have little to do with luck. Chances are, your competitor is using a variety of search engine optimization (SEO) tools, including content marketing, to drive web traffic to their page.</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in getting those page one Google results for yourself, you need to do the same.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And you need to do it more effectively than your competitors.</span></p>
<h2>What is Content Marketing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, content? But I’m a (plumber, personal trainer, attorney, real estate agent, etc.), not a writer or marketing professional. True, but as a pro in your field, you have lots of information and expertise to share with would-be customers. And this, says Greg Gifford, vice president of </span><a href="https://searchlabdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SearchLab, an SEO agency that specializes in helping small- and medium-sized businesses reach local customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the key to getting your page to pop up when someone Googles ‘plumber near me’ (for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Businesses) have to have better content on their site to answer the questions potential customers might be asking about products or services, to outshine competitors and look better to Google,” Gifford explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean making your home page wordier, says Gifford—it means adding content, in the form of a blog, to your website. The blog should contain “purely informational content” </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rather promotional/sales-oriented content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you can establish yourself as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local expert on the product or service you provide (the fact that you are a local business that wants to draw in local customers, as opposed to one with a wider geographical reach, doesn’t change anything about the content marketing you engage in other than the fact that you’ll need to use the same keywords local customers are using in searches). Even though the content isn’t written with the intent to make an immediate sale, it is likely to increase sales in the long run because readers will a) remember that they read something useful on your blog and b) return in the future with money in their pockets.</span></p>
<h2>What Type of Content Will Drive Traffic to My Website?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the type of content you post will depend directly on the type of business you are running. A plumber, for example, might post articles about how to unclog a toilet or deal with frozen pipes. An interior designer’s potential customers might like to read about how to select paint colors or how to remove wallpaper. For a coffee shop owner, articles that answer questions like “what is a macchiato?” or “can I make a latte with oat milk?” are bound to get hits. Just think about some of your industry’s most sought-after information, and go from there, says Gifford.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clincher: The content must be well-written, with plenty of strong/relevant keywords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Writing poorly-constructed content or content with grammatical and spelling errors is going to hurt you more than it will help you,” Gifford says.</span></p>
<h2>Should I Hire a Professional to do My Content Marketing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a good writer who also happens to have some basic SEO knowledge? Creating a content marketing plan and writing the content yourself is always a possibility (especially if your budget doesn’t allow you to outsource). If you decide to go this route, Gifford suggests taking some training courses rather than just winging it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a lot of free resources out there,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, bringing a professional onboard to help create a content marketing strategy is never a bad idea. For one thing, it frees you up to focus on other things (like actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best at what you do in town, rather than writing about it). Plus, professional content marketing strategists already have all the necessary knowledge and tools at their disposal, so they can get a program implemented in a reasonable timeframe without all the roadblocks you might encounter trying to figure it out yourself for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who do you hire to help? Options include full-service SEO agencies (like Gifford’s), smaller agencies that specialize specifically in content marketing or independent/freelance content marketing experts. All are great options, as long as the folks you are working with understand SEO and analytics along with content marketing strategy.</span></p>
<h2> Using Social Media to Market Your Local Business</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether you decide to outsource your content marketing or DIY, posting content on a blog is really just the beginning of an effective content marketing strategy. You’ll miss many opportunities to market your business locally if you fail to incorporate the use of social media into the plan (because social media is one of the most effective ways to let people know your content exists, says Gifford).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few ways to use social media as a content marketing tool:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post/share links to your content on your social media channels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with your audience on social media. If someone leaves a comment or asks a question, answer them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on the social media tools your target audience uses. TikTok sounds like fun, but is your target audience actually spending time on TikTok? If they aren’t, that isn’t a productive use of your time (at least not when it comes to advertising your local business).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, stick to channels that are well-suited to the type of business you run. A visually-oriented business, like a hair salon or a remodeling company, is a good candidate for Instagram. A plumbing service? Not so much.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t shy away from paid advertising, Gifford says, because “organic social reach is very, very low.” This means paying Facebook or Instagram, for example, to promote a post that links to your latest piece of content so that it gets in front of the audience you are trying to reach (otherwise, the link to the post you spent so much time on could fade away into Facebook oblivion).</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Do I Have to Develop a Content Marketing Strategy?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside to incorporating content marketing into your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-term marketing plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Time and money, of course. And no, you don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do it. But it really is one of the best ways to make sure your business stands out in the crowd, says Gifford. Plus, content marketing is an advertising strategy that is growing exponentially (</span><a href="https://www.technavio.com/report/content-marketing-market-industry-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one recent report indicated that the industry is expected to grow, as a whole, by more than $250 billion between now and 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Just be sure that your content marketing strategy is, well, strategic. Know your goals, know your audience, know your keywords and search terms—all before you start creating content. Armed with that information, you’ll be well on your way to creating a plan that will draw more traffic to your website and, ultimately, more customers through your front door.</span></p>

This year’s next Get to Know Your Customers Day is July 15. Consider it an opportunity to improve your customer relationships by adding names to faces, and finding out precisely what your customers love about your business and what added services and/or features might make them love it even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to know your customers goes beyond just learning their demographics or even their names. It can be more actionable for your business to learn what their pain points are, what problems they are trying to solve, what they expect, and even what their complaints are (both about your business and especially your competitors).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How (and why) did <em>Get to Know Your Customers Day</em> start?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific origins of the customer-centric holiday are unknown, but some sources trace it back to the early days of the e-commerce boom when brick-and-mortar establishments needed to find ways to avoid losing business to online retailers. And while the retail- and service-industry landscapes have evolved since then (particularly in the past year), the principles that guided the creation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customers Day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still apply. Namely, the importance of two-way communication between customers and businesses—according to Microsoft’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 State of Global Customer Service Report</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service-en-au.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of respondents nationwide look favorably upon businesses that solicit and respond to customer feedback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The tangible outcome? Increased loyalty to your brand, thanks to prioritization of the customer relationship.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observing <em>Get to Know Your<br />
Customers Day</em> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how, specifically, do you get to know your customers better (on January 21 and beyond)? Here’s a know-your-customer checklist, with five actions to help establish and nurture positive customer relationships.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Ask customers to complete a digital survey/questionnaire.</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customer Day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great opportunity to ask for that aforementioned feedback. Then, use the information you acquire to better meet their needs. If you already have a database of customer email addresses, you’re one step ahead. You can also post a link to your social media pages or tell them about the survey when they visit your establishment in person. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good probing questions include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you hear about us? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What product or service among our offerings is most important to you?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How often do you shop for our products and/or services?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How satisfied are you with our policies and procedures?</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take this a step further, consider conducting what Franz calls a journey mapping event, in which you gather information from customers about the “journey” that ultimately led to a purchase (she likes to do this in person if possible, but journey mapping can also occur digitally or remotely).  </span></p>
<p><b>2. Talk to them.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you can’t interact with customers face-to-face, conversations are still possible. Customers appreciate responses to social media posts and email messages. And if your business is currently open to the public, take some extra time on January 21 for genuine get-to-know-you conversations (Franz calls this ‘collecting breadcrumbs of data’). Once you know things like where they live, what they do for a living, how many children or pets they have and what they like to do for fun, you can create customer profiles—and these profiles will allow you to provide a more personalized experience to each individual (for example, you’ll know to call them when you receive a shipment of a product they love). If your doors are closed, no worries—social media is a great tool for info gathering too (many customers enjoy responding to inquisitive posts from business owners). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with customers through conversation is also an effective way to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage problems like late-paying customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A customer you know well is probably more likely to answer your inquiries about payment-related issues.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b>3. Host a giveaway.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oftentimes the mere opportunity to receive a gift is enough to draw someone in. Let them know how much you appreciate their loyalty by giving away a coveted product or service, or by offering a swag bag to the first 50 people to enter your establishment, or to anyone who returns the above mentioned survey. If your doors are closed due to Covid-19 restrictions, consider conducting giveaways on social media instead.</span></span></p>
<p><b>4. Hold a customer appreciation event. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invite customers to stop by during designated hours for refreshments, special discounts, prizes and casual conversation (essentially, a party in their honor).You can even set up the event outside if indoor events are prohibited.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b>5. Thank them.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And if live events, giveaways or surveys aren’t doable at the moment? Nothing beats a genuine ‘thank you’ when it comes to opening the lines of communication with a customer. Consider sending a card or email, or even picking up the phone to say “we appreciate your business” and to let them know you welcome feedback and conversation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting your plans to work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of knowing your customers and showing you care about them can require some modest investments, to cover events, promotions, of giveaways. If you don’t have the immediate budget for such initiatives, a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can give you fast access to the short-term cash you need to make these happen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1922217593-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Young smiling Black woman sitting at home behind her laptop removing her medical mask." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1922217593-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1922217593.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continued telecommuting once offices are again open after COVID-19 restrictions sounds appealing, but is it right for your small business? That depends on the business. </span><a href="https://associationofvas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent data obtained by the United States Bureau of Labor and Industries suggests that “63% of U.S. jobs require significant onsite presence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” This means that if your business is primarily service-oriented (retail, hospitality, trade-related, etc.), long-term telecommuting might not be possible for a significant portion of your workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the remaining 37% of jobs are fairly remote-friendly. If your business provides professional services or employs people in administrative roles, for example, permanent telecommuting is a very viable option. The key is to make it not only work for your business, but work</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recognition of this year’s Telecommuter Appreciation Week (March 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through March 7th—the holiday is celebrated the first week in March to coincide with the March 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> birthday of Alexander Graham Bell) here are six ways to make telecommuting better for your small business.</span></p>
<h2>Establish a remote work policy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you send everyone home with a laptop computer and permission to work in pajamas, it is absolutely critical to create a set of telecommuting guidelines so that everyone is on the same page, says Laurel Farrer, CEO of</span><a href="https://www.distributeconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Distribute Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a remote work consulting firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy, she says, is a mutual agreement between employer and employee, spelling out exactly what needs to happen in order to make telecommuting successful. While policies are customized to each individual business, they typically include things like communication expectations, work hours/meeting attendance, the type of office supplies and equipment to have on hand, and where to turn for help with technical difficulties. The policy also provides an opportunity to address subjects like work-life balance, sick leave, and the intersection of parenting and telecommuting (right now, Zoom meeting interruptions by mischievous toddlers are par for the course—but in the future, it may be reasonable to require childcare during work hours).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the policy something you just sit down and write on your own? No, says Farrer—it is imperative that you solicit suggestions and feedback from your telecommuting team members, since they have a vested interest in making sure the policy is practical and sustainable.</span></p>
<h2> Avoid micromanaging remote workers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your employees are telecommuting, resist the urge to watch them work on a webcam in order to make sure they aren’t taking too many breaks and scrolling Instagram while on the clock. Likewise, don’t require them to check in with you multiple times a day or to fill out lengthy status reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Micromanaging is only going to decrease the productivity metrics, and it is going to create a toxic culture,” says Farrer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, focus on results, she says. Give them projects with deadlines—and the autonomy to meet those deadlines. Let them know when they need to provide an update (once a day is fine), and allow them to ask for feedback or assistance when and if they need  it. You are still monitoring productivity, but in a non-imposing and supportive manner.</span></p>
<h2>Incorporate team building activities</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Socializing in the break room is an important part of office culture, and obviously that goes away if everyone is working from home. But camaraderie is still important, says Farrer, even if everyone is telecommuting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you can’t talk about puppies, you can’t talk about profit margins,” Farrer says, explaining that the ability to discuss low-pressure topics makes way for more effective communication when it comes to high-pressure topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recommends dedicating the first 10 minutes of team Zoom meetings to small talk or, if you use tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, creating “just for fun” channels where employees can share favorite recipes, talk about their weekend plans or discuss the books they are reading (for example). You can even host virtual games like trivia or bingo over Zoom, or have a team picnic at a local park (when/if outdoor group events are safe in your area).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are giving people an opportunity to be people, and not just workers,” Farrer says.</span></p>
<h2>Standardize tech tools for all telecommuters</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Zoom and Slack, if your team is remote it is absolutely essential that all team members use the same software and the same web-based tools for the same purpose, says Farrer. This means that you actually need to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your employees what to install and/or download, and provide it to them if necessary. Do you have to go out and buy the latest and greatest software package available to your industry? Definitely not—many businesses function just fine by using email and other basic tools. However, your team won’t be productive if team members aren’t all using tech tools in a cohesive manner. Even if some employees experience a learning curve at the start, your whole team will benefit in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, be aware that as a business owner it is up to you to supply remote employees with the tools they need to do their job. So, if you decide to require high-speed internet or a particular printer, be prepared to foot the bill. Despite the cost, this will make telecommuting better for your business overall because a) everyone will be able to work efficiently and b) the employees working from home will feel valued (because they are equipped, literally, to succeed).</span></p>
<h2>Prioritize mental health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all the benefits of telecommuting, there are a few downsides. For your employees, one of the big ones is the stress related to social isolation (not to mention burnout—research indicates that remote employees have always worked a lot, and nowadays they are putting in more hours than ever). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you can make telecommuting better for your small business by recognizing the importance of mental health and encouraging your employees to engage in self-care, says</span><a href="https://melissasmith.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa Smith, a remote work consultant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://associationofvas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO of the Association of Virtual Assistants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She recommends offering perks to your telecommuters, like online yoga classes or subscriptions to relaxation apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering a mental health day now and then, especially on a Friday or a Monday, is another great way to encourage balance. Showing your appreciation also makes an impact, Smith says. For example, you can provide gift cards for dinner if your employees are working late, or send a bouquet of flowers just to say “thank you.” These gestures, Smith explains, let your remote workers know that you see them, even if you don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">see</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them.</span></p>
<h2>Recognize the difference between &#8220;pandemic remote&#8221; and &#8220;regular remote&#8221;</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it is important to understand that telecommuting in response to Covid-19 is somewhat different than telecommuting under normal circumstances, says Farrer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is happening now is not remote work,” she says. “What is happening right now is an international contingency plan for a global catastrophe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this mean for your small business going forward? It means that at some point, the things that have made telecommuting difficult in recent months (like trying to help kids with schoolwork while simultaneously preparing an important presentation) will cease to exist. This will allow you, a small business owner, to really hone in on the tactics that are best for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small business and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people. The result? A successful and productive remote workforce. </span></p>

In fact, exhibiting at or attending gift markets and shows could be one of the most important things you do for your business.</p>
<p>“Gift shows are a great way to learn about new trends and products in the marketplace, what’s about to go viral and what’s not,” says Nicole Schaefer, founder of TheGiftingGoddess, a service in Portland Ore. that helps people find the perfect gifts for their loved ones, friends and clients.  “Shows are also a great way to connect and network with your peers and to learn with educational seminars … (and to) get an unfiltered look at what the competition is up to since information is almost always readily available and accessible (at the show).”</p>
<p>The dilemma: figuring out which shows and gift markets to attend. With so many held throughout the year in practically every region of the country—not to mention niche shows geared toward specific categories like gourmet, jewelry or collectibles—the choices are endless. Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t possibly attend them all.</p>
<p>We’re here to help with a fresh list of some of the best gift markets and shows around—plus a cheat sheet you can grab to keep them all handy. Here&#8217;s where the pros go to see and be discovered.</p>
<h2>Atlanta, Las Vegas are huge for gift pros</h2>
<p>First up is <a href="https://www.americasmart.com/markets/january-gift-home-rug/"><strong>The Atlanta International Gift and Home Furnishings Market</strong></a> at AmericasMart Atlanta.</p>
<p>If you want to see everything in one place, this 53-year-old market might be the one for you. With more than 7 million square feet of total exhibit space, AmericasMart is often pointed to as the largest market in the world. And the gift and home furnishings market, held twice a year in July and January, is certainly one of its biggest draws.</p>
<p>The Summer Market (scheduled this year for July 9th through 15th) alone has 8,000 brands exhibiting—and that doesn’t even include all of the permanent showrooms. Chelsea Peabody Bohannon, media relations manager for AmericasMart, says the show offers a mix of small and large brands, as well as international exhibitors and even some hyperlocal artisan vendors.</p>
<p>Kirstin Martin, owner of Smitten Boutique in Chicago, says she makes it a priority to attend the Atlanta market every year. She loves the layout as well as the quality of the exhibitors she finds there.</p>
<p>“(Last time) we went with a wish list, and we checked off most the items on our list,” she says.</p>
<p>If you want an experience similar to Atlanta but can’t make it all the way to the East Coast, the <a href="https://www.lasvegasmarket.com/"><strong>Las Vegas Summer Market</strong></a>, coming up July 28th through August 1st at World Market Center in Las Vegas, is a good alternative (the Winter 2020 market is January 26th through 30th). Even with 4,300+ exhibitors, the market remains walkable.</p>
<p>The focus, says PR Manager Dallas Britt, is on “exclusive products and programming” not easily found at other events, such as fundraisers for charitable organizations, celebrity appearances, and design awards.</p>

Image courtesy of ShoppeObject in NY.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>&#8220;Must attend&#8221; shows in NYC and beyond</h2>
<p>If you’re on the East Coast, don’t miss the classic <a href="https://www.nynow.com/"><strong>NY Now</strong></a> wholesale show, which many industry insiders such as Schaefer consider “a must.”</p>
<p>Rosie O’Neill, co-founder of the luxury confections brand Sugarfina says exhibiting at NY Now at the Javits Center in Manhattan has been a significant contributor to the success of her brand. The show boasts 2,300 exhibitors and more than 25,000 attendees. Sugarfina exhibits at both annual shows (this year’s summer show is August 10th-14th; dates for the Winter 2020 show are not yet available), and O’Neill says it enables her to really target Sugarfina’s ideal audience.</p>
<p>“We don’t think of ourselves as a confectionary brand,” she explains. “We are a lifestyle and gifting brand so we want to go to shows with that position.”</p>
<p>This is exactly what NY Now offers. O’Neill started exhibiting at the show in 2014 with the goal of creating brand awareness. She quickly met her goal.</p>
<p>“Now we have a really great line-up of accounts that we work with,” she says, adding that her company’s relationship with the brand Total Wine is a direct result of NY Now.</p>
<p>As long as you’re in New York, <a href="https://shoppeobject.com/"><strong>ShoppeObject</strong></a> is a very new but very up-and-coming show that is held at Pier 36 and happens to coincide with NY Now’s dates. Stacy Maiano of Red Sail, an accessory, home and gift boutique in Portland, OR, says she has found hundreds of designers that she loves at ShoppeObject—and the show has only been in existence since last summer. This summer’s show will be its third. She says she loves that the show is much more curated than some of the others she has attended, and quality of the designers is impeccable.</p>
<p>“We have an eye on advanced and progressive design-minded brands,” says Minya Quirk, ShoppeObject’s co-founder, adding that they are aiming to bring in sophisticated exhibitors who are catering to top-tier buyers.</p>
<p>Quirk says she anticipates around 400 brands and 8,000 attendees at the summer show. While so-far small, Maiano considers this show a must-attend for discerning buyers such as herself.</p>
<p>There are so many shows in this industry that these are just the beginning. In addition to the shows listed above it also hard to go wrong with the <a href="http://dallasmarketcenter.com/markets/"><strong>Dallas Total Home and Gift Market</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.the-reef.com/la-mart"><strong>LA Mart at The Reef</strong></a>, Schaefer says.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stylemaxonline.com/"><strong>StyleMax</strong></a> in Chicago is also highly recommended by many of the gift industry veterans we asked, along with <a href="https://seattlemart.com/"><strong>Seattle Mart</strong></a> and <a href="https://mplsmart.com/"><strong>Minneapolis Mart</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, the cost can be a factor when it comes to deciding which gift markets to attend. Schaefer recommends seeking out cost-saving opportunities like early registration, show-related hotel deals, incentives for first-time attendees and the possibility of getting day passes at reduced rates.  She also suggests looking into show sponsorship, since that frequently comes with incentives like free passes.</p>

<h2>Have a gift market game plan to maximize your time</h2>
<p>In terms of making the most of the shows you ultimately decide to attend, Martin says having a plan of attack is key. This means knowing what you are looking for along with what you are <em>not</em> looking for (for example, don’t spend a bunch of time looking at greeting cards if you know don’t need them).</p>
<p>“If you do not have a focus or a game plan, you [will] become overwhelmed,” she explains, adding that having a budget and comfortable shoes are also non-negotiable.</p>
<p>For brands looking to exhibit at a gift market, a game plan is just as important, albeit somewhat different. O’Neill recommends attending before exhibiting so you can get a feel for it. From there, she suggests starting out with just one show and making sure you can really focus on getting the most value out of it with your limited time.</p>
<p>“You are really going to learn a lot from your first show, so put your focus and effort into that,” she says.</p>
