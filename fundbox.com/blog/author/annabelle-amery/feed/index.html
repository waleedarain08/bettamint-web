Congratulations! That’s the hard part&#8230;or was it?</p>
<p>Now that your new funds are at your fingertips, you may be realizing that the battle has only just begun. Your next big challenge is deciding how to put those funds to the best possible use and realize a healthy return on investment.</p>
<p>How you decide to deploy your funds will always vary depending on your business, situation, and industry. That said, there are a few common things you’ll want to consider as you begin using this new capital.</p>
<p>Two central questions to start with are: First, how will I use this loan for my business—in one main area or spread across a few? And second, how will I repay it?</p>
<p>Here we’ll take you through how to use your first business loan effectively to get the most out of those hard-won funds.</p>
<h2>1. Don’t lose sight of long-term costs</h2>
<p>Your bank account feels full right now, but you’ll still need to think about cutting costs and planning your budget. You may have the funds to cover your expenses today, but you can never be too prepared for a future financial emergency. Put some money aside and build your safety net. Your future self will thank you.</p>
<h2>2. Make a constructive plan</h2>
<p>No matter what your business, it’s important to plan. Figure out the area (or areas) of your business that would benefit the most from an infusion of cash.</p>
<p>What this means for you will vary depending on your business stage and situation. A few common areas to focus on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventory<br />
</span>Stock and product are vital for the normal functioning of your business and it’s likely that this is where your loan will be spent, especially if you’re in the retail field. Using your funds to replenish your stock and purchase inventory can be a great way to manage <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/">seasonal dips</a></span> and even try out new products.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equipment </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Consider whether it’s time to purchase new equipment. Depending on your industry, that might include a new van for your delivery company or a new piece of machinery for your construction company. Equipment is often the driving force behind growth that can take your business to a whole new level, either by increasing your efficiency or allowing you to take on more clients.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operational expenses</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether it’s rent for a physical space, gas, utilities, internet services and more, at the end of the day, it all adds up. Before you know it those regular operational expenses can snowball out of control so it may be wise to delegate a portion of your loan towards keeping those lights on.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Marketing and advertising</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You may decide that using some of your loan for marketing is a valuable investment for expanding and drawing in new customers. After all, to grow your business you’ll need to get new customers through the door and stay memorable to old ones. This might mean investing in search engine advertising, print ads, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-customer-appreciation-ideas-for-your-home-services-business/">customer appreciation events</a></span>.</p>
<p>All of these areas can be great places to invest, whether you’re focusing on one of these key areas or spreading your business loan across a few. It all depends on what makes the most sense for your<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>business.</p>
<p>The key point here is that you’ll need a game plan detailing exactly how you’re going to strategically spend your loan. We propose that you have your plan ready <span style="font-style: italic;">before </span>you receive the funds (and then finalize it once you know exactly how much you&#8217;re qualified to receive).</p>
<h2>3. Launch a new product or service</h2>
<p>Already have a loyal customer base and strong sales? Sounds like your business is in good shape. For a business owner in this position, especially if competition is on the rise, it might just be the right time to launch a new product or service.</p>
<p>If you want to grow a long-term, sustainable business, you’ll need to stay one step ahead and not only think about next year but the next five years and beyond. A new product or service might be just what you need to keep old customers loyal and keep up with the forever evolving market.</p>
<h2>4. Pay off other debts or refinance</h2>
<p>If you’re not a first-timer when it comes to receiving financing, it may be that you have some debts. Borrowing from a large range of lenders, however, is often less economical than having a single loan, with a single repayment strategy.</p>
<p>Paying off old debts or consolidating your loans into one place will make it easier for you to manage and budget for payments, rather than juggling several different debts at various times of the month. Not only that, you may be able to find some significant cash savings in the process.</p>
<p>If you have several outstanding debts, take a look at all the interest rates and payments. Consolidating your debt into a single loan that charges a lower interest rate could be a great move for your business.</p>
<h2>Getting your first loan</h2>
<p>Now that you know which areas of your business to focus on when you receive your very first business loan, it’s time to get your hands on the funds in the first place.</p>

There are the long applications demanding copious amounts of information and after all of that effort, you can still wind up with a rejection. That’s a hard pill to swallow. It can happen to you and even happens to well-established companies.</p>
<p>So how can you increase the chances of getting a business loan?</p>
<h2>First, the stats</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.smefinanceforum.org/sites/default/files/post/files/Harvard%20White%20Paper.pdf">58% of businesses </a></span>can’t nail a loan at the big banks, essentially freezing their dreams and goals in place. According to recent data from Lending Express, within that 58% of businesses that can’t qualify at the banks, there are still 14% of ‘worthy’ businesses that are just inches away from being able to qualify for business loans.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, what about alternative lending? It&#8217;s a great option for many. However, it&#8217;s always good to know your options and understand them before making a decision.</p>
<p>Here we take you through what you can do to boost your odds of getting a business loan as well as how to reduce your ‘riskiness’.</p>
<h2>1. Clean up your credit score</h2>
<p>No way around it: business and personal credit scores are important. Credit scores are a factor that comes up again and again, and for good reason. Your credit scores make up the most influential factors when it comes to getting approved for a business loan from most sources. If your business is young, it wouldn’t have had the opportunity to establish much of a business credit score, which means lenders’ eyes will probably fall on your personal credit score.</p>
<p>Your ability to pay up on time is what’ll draw or deflect lenders, so make sure to set up automated payments so that you never miss one again. If it’s financially possible for you to do so, get current and work on paying down any existing borrowing so that you can improve your utilization rate (the ratio between what you owe and your credit limit for your various credit cards and lines of credit).</p>
<p>Building a good credit score takes dedication and patience. If you haven’t got the time to build up an excellent credit score, know that there are alternative options—even for those with lower scores (more on that later).</p>
<h2>2. Start mixing that credit—but not <span style="font-style: italic;">too </span>much</h2>
<p>Another area of your credit score that you should keep an eye on is your credit mix. Having experience with different types of credit is actually seen as a <span style="font-style: italic;">good </span>thing in a lender’s eyes &#8211; it shows you have more experience with juggling different types of financing.</p>
<p>Make sure however, that you don’t open accounts just for the sake of it, this can backfire big time in the long-run. You need to be sure that you open them only as you need instead of, for example, taking on an installment loan that you simply can’t afford just for the sake of mixing.</p>
<h2>3. Build a healthy business</h2>
<p>Getting your business to not just stand, but run is a challenge that every business faces.</p>
<p>Besides your credit score, it’s your business’s gross monthly revenue and overall ‘health’ that lenders want to see. They’ll be interested in whether your business is capable of generating not just a trickle, but a sturdy revenue with a solid cash flow. The more stable your cash flow, the less risky you’ll appear to lenders.</p>
<p>To keep gross monthly revenue nice and high, you’ll need to master the art of preventing your funds from running dry and find ways to increase your revenue. Whether it’s through increasing your customer base, encouraging returning users or even raising your prices (don’t overdo it, you’ve got to find that sweet spot), there are hundreds of ways to go about this!</p>
<p>Now if only there were such a thing as a hospital for businesses, where you could stroll in, have a check-up and then leave all fixed-up. Well, this doesn’t quite exist yet but there is a next best option and many things you can do to make your business more healthy&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.lending-express.com/">Lending Express</a></span> has a new dashboard ‘Lending Score<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />’, where businesses are deeply analyzed through AI and machine learning technology and then allocated a personalized funding profile. Each business is guided with insights and step-by-step actions as to how to increase their score (based on how their business looks in a lenders eyes) and ultimately find the shortest path towards funding. In the meanwhile, the business will be shown which loans it can qualify for (if any), and presented with how to improve its &#8220;fundability&#8221; and unlock <span style="font-style: italic;">better </span>funding opportunities.</p>
<h2>4. Get a time machine</h2>
<p>The longer your business has been open, the more data there is to analyze. Most lenders want to see at least six months (sometimes even two years) worth of data, though the most recent three months of your business are the most important. For startups, business age, unfortunately, is something that there is little control of and perhaps a time machine would be the ultimate solution to this one.</p>
<p>If a jump into the future isn’t possible, don’t worry. Young businesses may have fewer options but alternative funding solutions are out there. Many young companies turn to friends and family, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/">crowdfunding</a></span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">startup loans</span> to get through those early stages.</p>
<h2>5. Choose the right lender and product</h2>
<p>There are 100’s of different financing products and lenders on the market for small-medium businesses and taking a look at all of them is enough to make anyone dizzy. This is where matching technology fits into the market. You could either personally sift through all the different lenders and products under the sun, figuring out which one you may or may not qualify for (applying and potentially undergoing multiple credit checks in the process) or you could use a platform that does some of the work for you.</p>
<p>One such platform is Lending Express. With one application, Lending Express uses AI technology to match small- and medium-sized businesses seeking funding, with one of its 30+ partners (including Fundbox). You will then be able to see which of the lending partners and their products you might qualify for, saving time and reducing the need for so many hard credit pulls.</p>
<p>With so many financial products out there, it&#8217;s an option well worth considering when making your choice.</p>
