There&#8217;s a common misconception that a brand is just your company&#8217;s logo, but a brand is a lot more than that. Your brand is the perception customers have about your company and the experience customers have when they do business with you.</p>
<p>Every cleaning business has a brand, even if they don&#8217;t know it (and even if they don&#8217;t have a logo). Your company&#8217;s brand is what makes you unique and stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>A brand is never done developing, and as your business grows and changes, so should your brand. Whether you&#8217;re just <a href="https://academy.getjobber.com/articles/how-to-start-a-cleaning-business-with-no-money/" target="_blank">starting a cleaning business</a> or you&#8217;ve been running a successful cleaning business for years, you should periodically look at your brand and identify ways to improve.</p>
<h2><strong>Start with your staff</strong></h2>
<p>Your cleaning staff are the people that are out in the field representing your cleaning business. They are the face of the company to your customers and are an integral part of your company&#8217;s brand.</p>
<p>Even though cleaners spend much of their time alone, you should make sure to train your staff on communication and customer service skills. Your staff will be communicating with your clients on behalf of the company, and everything from how a cleaner greets a customer to how they deal with customer questions is an important part of the company&#8217;s brand.</p>
<p>Providing your staff with a simple-to-follow dress code or uniform is another a way to ensure your company comes across as professional. The uniform doesn&#8217;t need to be fancy—a simple dress code of all-black or dark pants and a colored tee (pick your favorite!) will do just fine.</p>
<p>The key is to be consistent and professional. If your clients expect top-notch customer service and a professional look, and you deliver, you&#8217;ll be putting yourself ahead of the competition.</p>
<h2><strong>Before and after the job</strong></h2>
<p>Your customers don&#8217;t just interact with your company when you are cleaning their home. The truth is, every interaction you have with a customer is a part of your brand. From the first time a customer phones your business to when it&#8217;s time for them to pay, each interaction influences the perception customers have about your company.</p>
<p>There are a few easy ways to help your brand and customer service stand out even when your company isn&#8217;t cleaning a home:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a standardized way that your team answers the phone. Answer with a positive greeting that includes the name of the person answering the phone and the name of your business. Just because you&#8217;re being professional doesn&#8217;t mean you need to be boring! Be friendly and make sure to answer the phone in a way that is a good representation of your company.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Remind your customers about upcoming appointments with a simple phone call or email. This is a great way to avoid any customer confusion and <a href="https://academy.getjobber.com/articles/prevent-last-minute-cancellations/" target="_blank">prevent last-minute cancellations</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Send your <a href="https://academy.getjobber.com/articles/3-ways-improve-customer-service-followup-emails/" target="_blank">customer a follow-up email</a> once the clean is complete. You can ensure your customer is happy with the clean, and your company stays top of mind after the job is done.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Get your cleaning business online</strong></h2>
<p>An online presence gives your business credibility and allows people to confirm your business exists.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? Get started with social media. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide free and easy ways for you to get your business online. These platforms give your company an opportunity to engage with potential and existing customers. Share company updates, behind-the-scenes photos, and customer testimonials. Start with one platform first (we recommend Facebook), and once you feel comfortable, you can grow your online presence.</p>
<p>Online reviews are one of the best ways to help your company stand out. Anything your customers say about your company will carry more credibility than what you say about your own work. Talk to some of your best customers and see if they&#8217;d be willing to write an online review about your company. Google Business Listings, your Facebook page, and Yelp are great places to start.</p>
