										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="494" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1222932370-768x494.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1222932370-768x494.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1222932370.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Every company needs new customers in order to grow. But a business can’t lose focus from keeping the valued customers it already has. This is particularly true for small business owners who know just how difficult it can be to bring customers through the door.</p>
<p>While you want to be creative and invent new strategies to make your products and services look enticing, you’ll need to strike a balance between bringing in new customers and retaining your loyal ones. There are plenty of innovative ways to attract people’s attention, but keeping it is another story. If you’re a small business owner with limited time and resources, focus on these three areas of lead generation and customer retention:</p>
<h2>Examine your customer list</h2>
<p>Determine who on your customer or client list is coming back and who is giving you the most business. Is there a way that you can work better for them? Once you figure out what draws those customers back, you can determine some ways to bring in new customers based on that information.</p>
<p>But remember, it’s all about finding the middle ground. You want your marketing strategy to be interesting and informative to new prospects, but you also want to make sure your loyal customers are happy and promoting you to their networks. If you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pareto-principle">apply the Pareto Principle to your business</a></span>, you presume that 80 percent of your revenue is generated by 20 percent of your customer base. That means, your success is largely dependent on the loyalty of your existing customers.</p>
<h2>Harness your social media power</h2>
<p>Is your small business on social media? If it isn&#8217;t, it should be. You know customer retention is crucial to the survival of your business, and should also know you can&#8217;t do it without building solid relationships. Those relationships are a two-way street. Social media is a great place for customers to connect with your brand and for your brand to connect with them.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to reach new customers and strengthen your relationship with old ones through social media:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-use-facebook-ppc-ads-and-popups-to-get-more-business/">paid advertisement on Facebook</a></span></li>
<li>Have an Instagram sale</li>
<li>Run a contest on Twitter</li>
<li>Use Google+ to build new connections</li>
</ul>
<p>When using social media to connect with your customers, you must be an attentive listener. While providing contests and giveaways is a nice way to attract customers, show off your brand, and build your following, you also need to focus on customer satisfaction. This means answering every question you receive, acknowledging comments, and engaging in conversations with customers.</p>
<h2>Generate new products and services</h2>
<p>Expanding your offering is an effective way to bring in new customers. While you may be hesitant to take on more debt to support innovation, remaining competitive should be a priority for any business and there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/simple-small-business-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part4Customers&amp;keywords=2">smart ways to finance your efforts</a></span>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/short-term-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part4Customers&amp;keywords=3">Short term business loans</a></span> are a fast and easy way to get cash in hand when you need it for things such as financing a new growth opportunity. Short term loans can cover project costs that will be recouped in a few months, bridging a seasonal sales slowdown, or even purchasing inventory at a great price. There are no restrictions on how you can use the funds.</p>
<p>Remember that in addition to helping you generate new products and services to attract and retain customers, using short term financing can help you improve your credit history and score, build a thicker credit profile, and help you qualify for different types of financing down the road. The key is to be smart about calculating the return on investment for your business before you take on this type of financing.</p>

<p>Any business owner will tell you, it takes courage to go out on your own. Leaving behind a comfortable 9 to 5 to turn a dream into a full-time job takes a measure of doing. When you consider the long hours, the stress, the people management, and the never-ending list of responsibilities, there’s only one thing that keeps small business owners going when times start to get tough: passion.</p>
<p>But what happens when that passion starts to wane and your motivation begins to suffer?</p>
<p>You may think it won’t happen to you, but there are many reasons why passion fades as a business grows.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are also ways to avoid it. Here are a few things to look out for as you seek to stay motivated through the challenges of running a small business, as well as tips on how <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/simple-small-business-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part3Passionate&amp;keywords=2">smart financing</a></span> can help you maintain the passion you need to succeed:</p>
<h2>Burnout</h2>
<p>Success doesn’t happen overnight, and small business owners know that. But reaching for success day in and day out can often lead to burnout. It might not be obvious when burnout rears its ugly head; some common signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Anxiety and panic attacks</li>
<li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not uncommon for hardworking small business owners to feel a burnout approaching. A 2016 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">study</span> from Business Networking International found that one in four entrepreneurs say they feel moderately burned out. When burnout starts to happen, there are a few ways small business owners can pump some gas back into the tank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate to lessen the workload</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Take a vacation</li>
<li>Disconnect from digital life, including work e-mail, for a few days</li>
<li>Designate at least one day off every week and stick to it</li>
</ul>
<p>Burnout isn’t something to take lightly—understand the signs of burnout and have a few tools for managing it so you can come back refreshed and energized.</p>
<h2>Fear of competition</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty normal as a small business owner to fear a competitor might put you out of business. But that fear can be crippling. By fearing your competitors and putting your focus on them, you are giving them a great deal of power. Instead, focus your time and energy on making your customers happy and improving your own business.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad idea to keep up with what your competition is doing, but it’s more important to reflect on your own business. Take some time to ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your business good at?</li>
<li>What is your business bad at?</li>
<li>What’s your long-term plan?</li>
<li>Who is your competition?</li>
<li>How are you going to make adjustments to improve?</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of fearing the competition or being complacent about it, think of all the ways you can be better and subsequently, outperform the competition.</p>
<h2>Feeling uninspired</h2>
<p>Getting stuck is part of life. We all hit roadblocks, fall into exhaustion, and have difficult challenges to navigate. In business, learning how to get unstuck is critical. If you’re feeling stuck, try taking a break, free from guilt. You’ll come back more relaxed and productive.</p>
<p>Another effective way of getting out of an uninspired rut is to talk to someone. It’s much easier to approach a problem with support from people in your network. Talk to an employee, a business partner or even a business coach to get the ideas flowing again and restore your excitement and motivation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10040" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_523778200.jpg" alt="Running a business, it's easy to get burned out." width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_523778200.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_523778200-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2>Money troubles</h2>
<p>Every business has to handle peaks and valleys in revenue, and these large swings can make it difficult to manage your cash flow. The reality is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmorganchase/en/legacy/corporate/institute/document/institute-growth-vitality-cash-flows-exec-summary.pdf">most small businesses fail within five years</a></span>, in large part because they don’t have the capital to keep the doors open. When it comes to using smart financing to solve this big problem, the secret lies in being proactive about accessing capital.</p>
<p>Business credit cards, lines of credit, short term loans and cash advances are all ways to be proactive about money problems. When you have access to funds you can build a safety net for cash flow emergencies as well as better support innovation and prevent missed opportunities for your business to grow.</p>
<p>Having sufficient funds to innovate and grow helps you maintain the entrepreneurial passion that drove you to start your business in the first place. To get ahead of this, make sure you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part3Passionate&amp;keywords=3">understand the pros and cons of each type of financing</a></span> as well as your return on investment before deciding which one is right for you and your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_278513663-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Helpful Strategies to Manage Your Next Cash Flow Crunch" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_278513663-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_278513663.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Porters Bar &amp; Grill</span> in Boston is a lively neighborhood watering hole for concert-goers and sports fans alike. Located near TD Garden (home of the Celtics and Bruins), the pub is a popular destination for after-hours visitors looking for comfort food and local beer.</p>
<p>But in the summertime, the area goes dark, the ice on the hockey rink melts, and the event facilities furlough their employees. With its busy season heavily concentrated between October and April, the lean summer months present a tough cash flow situation for Porters.</p>
<p>Not all businesses experience the same degree of seasonality as Porters, but most businesses do have predictable times of year when business is significantly slower. These large swings in revenue make it difficult to manage cash flow throughout the year.</p>
<p>The harsh reality is most small businesses fail within five years because they don’t have the capital to keep the doors open, according to a new <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmorganchase/en/legacy/corporate/institute/document/institute-growth-vitality-cash-flows-exec-summary.pdf" rel="nofollow">study</a></span>. The life expectancy of businesses in specific industries is closely tied to the cash flow challenges each presents:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Real estate: </span>9 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Health care services: </span>8.8 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">High-tech services:   </span>6.2 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Construction:</span> 5.1 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal services:</span> 4.9 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wholesalers:</span>  4.7 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Repair &amp; maintenance: </span> 4.6 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retail:</span> 4 years</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Restaurants</span>: 3.7 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The study also reveals that working capital loans and lines of credit can help small businesses manage irregular cash flow and extend the life of their operations. The research shows that cash flow management is as important as liquidity. If a small business can’t properly manage its cash flow, it’s unlikely to grow. With a loan to get through the lean months and get cash flow back on track, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/blog/small-business-spotlights/porters-bar/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=2" rel="nofollow">Porters Bar &amp; Grill has far exceeded its life expectancy</a></span> and is positioned to increase its annual revenue.</p>
<p>There are many <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/">ways to manage cash flow in a seasonal business</a></span>, or to handle the peaks and valleys in revenue that every business experiences. But when it comes to using smart financing to solve this big problem, the secret lies in being proactive about accessing capital.  Sometimes, the <a href="https://www.mymillennialguide.com/best-money-making-apps-for-2017/">best money making apps</a> can help you gain additional income.</p>
<p>Here are five ways to put this principle into practice.</p>
<h2>Invoice financing</h2>
<p>Invoice financing is easy to confuse with invoice <span style="font-style: italic;">factoring</span>, and it’s helpful to know about both. Invoice <span style="font-style: italic;">factoring</span> allows your business to sell its invoices at a discount in exchange for a lump sum of cash. Invoice factoring can provide immediate working capital to help cover any cash flow issues and is typically easier to get approved for than traditional bank loans.</p>
<p>But, traditional invoice factoring generally requires you to sell your unpaid invoices to a third party factoring company. Your customers then pay the factoring company—not you. A slightly different approach called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invoice </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">financing</span> can help you avoid this less-than-ideal repayment scenario, giving you access to a revolving credit line that won’t affect your client relationships.</p>
<h2>Business credit cards</h2>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business credit card</span> is great for capital upgrades such as computers but can also be handy for emergency situations and slow seasons. Like personal credit cards, business credit cards offer the benefit of rewards like cash, points, or miles based on how much you spend.</p>
<p>If you have trouble staying within budget or tend to overspend, be careful with cards. Also be aware of annual fees and interest rates, and take advantage of promotional rates when you can. Always do your research before applying.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9938" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_567634105.jpg" alt="Business Credit Cards" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_567634105.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutterstock_567634105-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>Lines of credit</h2>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business line of credit</span> is a loan that allows you to withdraw money, when you need it, from a set amount instead of borrowing a lump sum. Business lines of credit are a great option if you’re looking to buy goods, grow your business, and/or expand your company, and they can also be an invaluable lifeline in case of an emergency or a cash flow crunch.</p>
<h2>Short term loans</h2>
<p>A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">short term business loan</span> can keep your company operating through slower seasons and help you cover unplanned expenses. They’re also handy for helping you finance unexpected growth opportunities that pop up. Short term loans typically offer smaller funding amounts with higher interest rates—around 10% and higher—and they have shorter repayment periods. It’s not uncommon for lenders to request that borrowers pay back the loan on a weekly or daily basis.</p>
<h2>Cash advances</h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/cash-advance/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=4">C</a>a<a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/cash-advance/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=4">sh </a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">advances</span> are quick and unsecured, which means you won’t have to forfeit any personal or business assets if business is bad. Because there is no fixed term with cash advances, they can be a great solution for businesses that need to pay less during slower months.</p>
<p>Cash advances generally come with a high annual percentage rate, and this can make them far more expensive than a traditional business loan. Business owners should proceed with caution to fully understand the terms and properly vet any cash advance provider before jumping in. Make sure you understand the provider’s interest rates, how the rates compare to other loan products, and how they compare to other providers’ rates.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing cash flow crunches, aim to play offense, not defense. When you’re proactive about accessing funds you can build a safety net for cash flow emergencies as well as better support innovation and prevent missed opportunities for your business to grow. Proactive financing will allow you to make things happen, rather than waiting for something to happen so you can take your business to the next level on your timeline.</p>

<h2>4 Hiring Challenges and Solutions for Small Business Owners</h2>
<p>Small businesses can face any number of challenges from the size of their company to its lack of resources, and very few of these challenges are as unavoidable and difficult to overcome as finding the right employees. According to The Megaphone of Main Street Small Business Jobs <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mentoring.redesign/s3fs-public/SCORE-Megaphone-Main-Street-Infographic-1-Small-Business-Employment_0.pdf">report</a></span>, half of small businesses say hiring new employees was the top challenge they faced in 2017.</p>
<p>Key highlights from the report show a variety of issues among small businesses when it comes to hiring:</p>
<ul>
<li>51.3% cannot find qualified applicants (when it comes to skills and expertise)</li>
<li>26.2% need to raise salary or wages to be competitive</li>
<li>12.9% need to offer other benefits to attract workers</li>
</ul>
<p>Hiring the right employees can be overwhelming, but understanding the challenges you’re up against can help your small businesses proceed strategically. Here are four of the most common hiring frustrations for business owners and how to overcome them:</p>
<h2>1. Finding qualified applicants</h2>
<p>It’s not uncommon for small business owners to have a limited pool of qualified applicants to choose from versus larger companies with more recruiting resources. If you want to recruit new talent without a lot of cost, often your best bet is to actively search for candidates using social networks such as LinkedIn or Facebook, and encourage your friends and employees to do the same—word of mouth is powerful and doesn’t cost you a thing.</p>
<p>You may also need to turn your approach away from hiring the cheapest labor you can find—such as recent college graduates—toward seeking candidates with more experience. You’ll find that by hiring more experienced workers who are mature, self-starters that don’t need constant supervision, you’ll free up your time for more important work.</p>
<p>Casting a wider net is worth it to find the right candidate. As hiring is a long-term investment in your company and can significantly accelerate growth, it may be well-worth <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/simple-small-business-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=HiringChallenges&amp;keywords=1">proactively seeking funds</a></span> to invest in the process. Once you’ve carefully calculated the return on investment, you can create a smart borrowing strategy to help you bring aboard the right talent that will help your business grow.</p>
<h2>2. Offering a competitive salary</h2>
<p>One of the biggest hiring challenges for small business owners is offering competitive salaries. While you may be tempted to offer new hires minimum wage from the get-go, start by conducting thorough research in your industry to determine the average pay for the position. You don’t need to pay the highest salary, but compensating new employees fairly will help you recruit quality employees and ensure they want to stay.</p>
<p>In addition to competitive compensation, consider <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/business-line-of-credit?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=HiringChallenges&amp;keywords=2">investing in your employees</a></span> through other benefits such as a generous time off policy, flexible summer hours, a dog-friendly environment, happy hour, remote work opportunities, or a fully-stocked kitchen. While pay is important, remember there are creative ways to level the wage playing field to attract and retain top talent.</p>
<h2>3. Lack of training</h2>
<p>Training is crucial in any size business, both for getting new employees up-to-speed and for helping your current staff build new skills. While larger businesses tend to have the means and resources for larger-scale training programs or initiatives, small business owners have to be more innovative when it comes to getting employees ready to work.</p>
<p>Think of training as an important investment in your business. Though it will cost you, offering courses and educational opportunities to help your employees advance professionally will immediately benefit the business as well. And advertising these types of benefits will help you attract those qualified candidates you’re seeking.</p>
<p>At the very least, you should invest in resources such as welcome packets, employee handbooks, and dedicated <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-onboard-new-employees/">training time for new hires</a></span> to shadow more senior-level employees. You can also host learning sessions for the entire team so employees can learn from each other while also promoting teamwork.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9801" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_524374522.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_524374522.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_524374522-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2>4. Wearing too many hats</h2>
<p>Small businesses are just that: small. As a business owner, you wear many different hats, and so do your employees. When you don’t have the means to hire dedicated staff for every department, your small staff will need to be willing to pitch in and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-build-a-backup-bench-of-employees/">work as a team to make the business successful</a></span>. It helps to be upfront about what the job entails from the beginning.</p>
<p>Consider investing in a recruiter who can help you find prospective employees with diverse backgrounds and across-the-board experience that will be a good fit for your needs. While it may cost you more money up front to recruit and vet out the most well-rounded candidates, finding the perfect match will pay off in the long run.</p>
