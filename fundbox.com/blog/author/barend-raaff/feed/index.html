This is where landing pages–that is, the page on your site where your users first land–come in. While they are created with the aim of encouraging visitors to interact with your website in small ways, the ultimate goal of a landing page is to make them buy your product.</p>
<p>Think of your company website as the central hub of all your online business activities. This is where you provide the vital information that people need to become paying customers. This includes things like detailed information on a product or service, customer support vehicles, buying options–all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">factors that push visitors to conversion</span>.</p>
<p>Landing pages are like the messengers that go out into the world and raise awareness for what you have to offer. The more intricate your business operations are, the more diverse your landing pages should be. This is why <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2015/08/data-talks-2-proven-lead-generation-tactics-to-jump-on-now.html">nearly 70% of B2B companies</a></span> use them to generate <a href="https://www.followupboss.com/blog/13-timeless-sales-principles-generate-leads-business/">new sales leads</a>. Your website provides numerous paths to bring in revenue, along which landing pages are meant to encourage a specific action.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss how these types of pages can help support and develop your business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Grab attention</span></h2>
<p>You can have the best product or service on the face of the planet. But, if no one knows it exists, it’s not doing you or the public any good. Landing pages are crucial for introducing people to the top of the sales funnel, or, the awareness stage. Even more, these pages give users a look at your brand’s style, feel, and the relationship it has with the world around it.</p>
<p>Landing pages form the first impressions to what your business is all about. Therefore, compelling elements should be present in order to encourage viewers to take immediate action. These include visual components like videos, images, graphics, and of course, compelling CTAs. Studies have found that people respond better to visual information over text, so make sure you get the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/visual-hierarchy/">visual hierarchy</a></span> of your landing pages right.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/8f66ed31-bef8-4706-b3af-292f70529695_image2.jpg" alt="https://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/image2-568x390.jpg" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, marketing of any kind is all about attention. Regardless of how you use landing pages to promote your brand, it needs to be done in a captivating way that prompts engagement.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Strategically support business goals</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of using landing pages is that they give you opportunities to diversify your strategy around different objectives. Whether it be to promote a new product or service, reach a new market or close sales, you can design these pages to cater to the most susceptible audience.</p>
<p>Using targeting tactics based on your research, certain pages can be factored into your business model to drive development. For example, let’s say you want to promote your messaging in a certain location. Through the use of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/local-seo/how-to-capture-more-customers-with-regionalised-landing-pages/">regionalized landing pages</a></span>, you can increase engagement in specific areas. This particular practice is especially useful in promoting content that pertains to a niche market.</p>
<p>Whichever goal you are working towards, landing pages are one of the best ways to reach prospective customers – wherever they might be.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Improve effectiveness of content marketing</span></h2>
<p>Content marketing is an extremely hot button topic in the modern business landscape. Businesses across the board are significantly <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.pointvisible.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics-and-trends-2017/">increasing their investment</a></span> in this area with no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/5faf4c14-f9aa-4b0c-9dd7-e80afd8cbe22_image3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Assuming the majority of your content is home-based on your website, unfortunately, the “build it and they will come” mindset will not result in nearly the amount of traffic you typically need to run a profitable business. That being said, landing pages are incredibly useful in spreading your messaging around the web.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say you regularly post content on your website and distribute it through social media profiles, email, PPC, and more. Landing pages can be used for bringing actionable attention to your chosen marketing channels by prompting visitors to follow, sign up, and check out the messaging you promote with your content.</p>
<p>In ecommerce, this has actual implications in selling. Ecommerce platform Shopify has a landing page for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/pos/retail">retail point of sale (POS)</a></span> systems that enables retailers integrate their online and offline sales. Shopify supplements this with a content strategy that helps sellers build customer profiles, manage inventory, and improve business in general <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/pos-data-how-to-use-information-from-your-point-of-sale-to-improve-your-business">using this POS data</a></span>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Build credibility</span></h2>
<p>In the online business world, credibility is a currency that is way more valuable than money. Without it, the money is practically nonexistent and opportunities are scarce. Your ability to showcase expertise in the industry is an enormous factor in presenting your unique selling proposition and solidifying buying decisions.</p>
<p>Your landing pages should communicate credibility upon first glance. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can achieve this.</p>
<p>For starters, everyone knows how important third-party validations are, such as online reviews and testimonials, when it comes to influencing decisions. Keeping this mind, building your landing pages to feature a quote or positive word of reinforcement can very powerful in establishing credibility. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://blog.visme.co/social-proof/">Social proof</a></span> works to make your landing pages convincing.</p>
<p><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2eb91679-940d-4987-b3e0-3a7f89b2fab5_image4.png" alt="How to Gain Instant Credibility with Visual Social Proof trust seals" /></p>
<p>If you go this route, be sure to keep it short and concise. If designed correctly, you can have multiple testimonies present on your landing pages. Additionally, a positive photo is a great touch.</p>
<p>Another fantastic way to build credibility with your landing pages is with personalization. Effective copy speaks directly to the reader. When a user glances at your page, they should be able to feel an immediate connection with it. Even more, it should genuinely understand their pain points and concerns. Achieving this feat is the key to marketing. This can all be traced back to your research and ability to capitalize on industry trends.</p>
<p>For example, there were a ton of businesses whose search engine rankings took a hit following the latest <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.e2msolutions.com/blog/google-search-algorithm-updates-2017/">Google algorithm updates</a></span>. For an SEO agency looking for prospective clients, designing landing pages to address these concerns and present unique solutions would be a phenomenal way to draw in the viewers who are searching for answers.</p>
<p>Competition in the age of the internet is fiercer than ever. When push comes to shove, credibility is what sets brands apart. In terms of landing pages, it must be presented as quickly and clearly as possible.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">In conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Landing pages are one of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most important ingredients</span> in the modern marketing mix. They serve all kinds of functions related to promoting your branded content, nurturing relationships, learning more about your audience, determining your next move, and much more.</p>
<p>Take your time in creating them. These pages are your essential building blocks to achieving a healthy ROI.</p>
