That’s why we say small business is in our DNA. One such example is our Fundbox Chief of Staff, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/humans-fundbox-emad-elshawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emad ElShawa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who was featured in a recent </span><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/SF-Sams-Burgers-North-Beach-Anthony-Bourdain-16059579.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFGate article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about his restaurant Sam’s, noted as “One of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s favorite burgers in the world.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15467" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/samsout2-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15467" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/samsout2-1.png" alt="Street view of Sam's Burgers, open since 1966." width="600" height="337" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15467" class="wp-caption-text">Sam&#8217;s restaurant in San Francisco.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a moment to catch up with Emad to share an even deeper story behind his lifetime of helping to run a popular family business and how this also drives his work at Fundbox to help others.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
We’d really like to get your experience as a small business owner, to understand a little bit of the trials and tribulations, challenges and opportunities. To start, please tell us a little bit about your experiences growing up.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The restaurant itself we opened in 1966 and my dad originally was working with his uncle, named Sam, when he opened it. Back then it really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a grind, with my dad trying to raise a family and get a business off the ground at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was literally working 7 days a week 365 days a year. He really never took a day off. But Sam realized pretty quickly that just wasn’t the lifestyle for him, so he decided to go a different direction. My dad took over the restaurant in 1967, keeping the name. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
What gave your dad and uncle the idea to open a restaurant, especially something as specific as a burger place?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad immigrated to the United States when he was 19 years old, originally from Palestine. After he graduated high school, he worked on a farm and then became a butcher. So what he understood more than anything was meat—how to make a good cut of meat, cook it, and serve it properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that really helped him narrow down his options and say, “Okay, this is what I know how to do best and what I think I can make successful.” That’s where the original idea of Sam&#8217;s came from. My dad knew he wanted to run a burger place. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
How did your location in the uniquely nightlife-driven San Francisco neighborhood  of North Beach affect your Dad’s business?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Beach is not normal. It&#8217;s not a normal place for hamburgers nor really any area to run a restaurant. Historically speaking, North Beach was the area where the bars, the jazz clubs, and all the speakeasies and strip clubs were, even back in the 1960s. It&#8217;s kept some form of that throughout the last 50 years. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15468" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15468" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png" alt="A photo looking up Broadway Street in San Francisco, with iconic neon signs in the foreground and an arrow pointing to the location of Sam's restaurant halfway up the block." width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15468" class="wp-caption-text">Broadway Street, North Beach/Chinatown in 2012. Photo by John O&#8217;Neill.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, Sam’s hours were from 4:00 in the afternoon to 4:00 in the morning—because that&#8217;s when people would go out there to get some drinks, and then they would want some food after that. So Sam’s became a super late-night place, the majority of our business happening between 1:00 and 4:00 in the morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So imagine that. Add to the daily grind not only having to work 12 to 15 hours a day, but those hours are in the middle of the night. So you’re working when everyone else is sleeping and sleeping when everyone else is awake, and then getting up to do it all over again, back-to-back. It’s like having no life.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
I know that over the years you have not been the only burger restaurant in North Beach, but you seem to be one of the few that survived.</h3>
<p><strong>Emad:</strong><b><br />
</b>Sam&#8217;s being in the neighborhood has become something that holds a cultural significance to the City. In the early 2000s, my dad realized that people were coming to Sam&#8217;s just because they wanted a taste of authentic San Francisco. It wasn&#8217;t just a burger place. People started to equate Sam&#8217;s with an authentic San Francisco experience.</p>
<h5><b>[EDITOR’S NOTE:] In honor of its continuous operation—365 days per year since its founding in 1966—Sam’s Burgers is now poised to </b><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/An-authentic-San-Francisco-experience-16197716.php#photo-21030186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>gain Legacy Business status</b></a><b>, already approved by the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission (pending a final vote by the Small Business Commission on June 6, 2021.)</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Other burger places did try to get a piece of the action. A Carl&#8217;s Jr. opened up about a block from where we are. That was one of the biggest scares for my dad, because until then, you had never had these big fast food chains coming into North Beach. We wondered, “What is our actual staying power as a small business?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This difference in dealing with chains and franchises is that you’re not competing with other mom-and-pop burger shops and small restaurants. You&#8217;re now competing with an organization that has deep pockets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, that Carl&#8217;s Jr. only lasted pretty much a year and went out of business. Apparently, people preferred supporting the neighborhood and wanted to continue enjoying that authentic San Francisco experience. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>You need that personal touch with your customers because people aren&#8217;t just coming in for the burgers. They&#8217;re coming in to hear your story. They&#8217;re coming in to hear stories of San Francisco from 30 and 40 years ago.</em></strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Fundbox: </strong><br />
&#8220;In all your years running a restaurant, what stands out as something you’ve learned about small businesses success?</h3>
<p><strong>Emad:</strong><br />
A lot of people ask me, “Why did your dad work 50 years seven days a week? Why don&#8217;t you just hire a bunch of people and sit at home and manage the place?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m a firm believer that small businesses and restaurants in general will have as much success as their owners&#8217; involvement in the place. You can’t be a successful small business owner by being an absentee owner. I&#8217;m not saying that you need to be there every day—but if you are there every day, it does add some sense of additional success by being close enough to manage any step of the process when you need to. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15461" style="width: 303px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15461" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg" alt="Emad ElShawa" width="303" height="303" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg 1056w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2-768x769.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15461" class="wp-caption-text">Emad ElShawa</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very prideful point for my dad was to say, “We&#8217;ve made every last burger better than the one before it.” When you delegate that mission to employees, it’s hard to really guarantee that level of quality. But when you&#8217;re doing it yourself, it matters so much to you that you&#8217;re serving every last customer with that same attitude.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>What financial challenges have your family faced running a small business for so many decades?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the biggest trials we&#8217;ve had is just the amount of sheer work that it took to keep that up for 55 years in terms of financial troubles. I will say we&#8217;ve been lucky up until this last year, and that while business wasn’t always gangbusters like it had been for the 15 years before COVID, we&#8217;ve always had enough to where we knew we had our bills covered and we can get by.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How did COVID impact your business?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was challenging. We weren&#8217;t immune from everything that came with the pandemic, since the business was closed. That meant we had to essentially fund everything out of pocket at that point. We were still paying our four full-time employees. We paid them all to sit at home—because part of a smart business strategy is when you find good employees, you don&#8217;t want to let go of them. They become a part of the family and a part of the success of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one of our employees has been with us for eight years. These are people that are embedded in the fabric of our business. Customers come in and ask for them personally. So it&#8217;s very difficult for us to go and say hey we got a pandemic going on. There was no revenue coming in but we had to figure out a way to pay our people enough to support their families (in addition to rent and utilities) with zero money coming in, which we did for the first couple months. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><strong>Part of a smart business strategy is when you find good employees, you don&#8217;t want to let go of them. They become a part of the family and a part of the success of the business.</strong></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a very stressful time, to be quite honest. We were just hemorrhaging money as things started to slowly reopen—but not really reopen, just to be open for business. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How did Sam’s adapt to the new normal?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to completely pivot how we did business throughout our history. Sam&#8217;s is an old-school place. We did not accept credit cards. We were not on any of these delivery apps. We were used to being the place the neighborhood and people around would come in and that was part of the aura in the mystique and the simplicity of Sam&#8217;s for 55 years. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><strong>We realized really quickly that if we&#8217;re going to have any sort of success of making it through this we were going to have to race to come up-to-date. </strong></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We said, “All right, let&#8217;s add as many of these delivery apps as possible. Let&#8217;s figure out how to price things to where we could still pay the delivery apps’ cut and still come out ahead.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also needed to figure out a way where we could add credit cards really quickly. Having a credit card machine is a little bit more difficult than it is anywhere else because it&#8217;s literally an alleyway restaurant. We needed to figure out a way to physically structure the place so people could pay without actually having face-to-face or hand-to-hand touch with any one of our employees. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How has your recovery been going?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic yet, but the worst of it was about a year. We were open for business, but we were losing money every single month. Nevertheless, we never ever had the conversation of attempting to close. The conversation was how we were going to get to the other side of this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s so embedded in the fabric of our family now, and I think even in the fabric of the community, that closing it down would hurt a lot of us significantly. Long term we knew we wanted to contribute to San Francisco coming back. We wanted to be part of North Beach. It was just like a day-to-day pivot of how we can actually get there.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>You’re not just a part of your family business; you’re also part of the Fundbox family. What was your professional background that led to your work in fintech and with us?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born and raised in San Francisco, and educated in public schools in San Francisco throughout my life—Lincoln High School, then City College, then San Francisco State, then Golden Gate University after that. A large San Francisco bank offered me a work sponsorship program, so I started my first job actually during college as a banker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working for this bank, I saw people from all walks of life coming in. The biggest thing for me was that I could connect directly with small business owners because that’s what I knew. I saw my dad do it every single day. I could naturally talk with a small business owner about the difficulties they were having and relate it to what I saw my own family do to combat those difficulties. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Tell us more about how you focused on small business banking.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating and for about seven years with a major bank, I was the head of small business banking for San Francisco and Marin. During that time I would see a lot of those customers facing the pain points of dealing with traditional banks. For example, taking time out of their day to come and talk to a banker in person, having to bring all these documents, and then having to wait for money that might not come.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
How well have small businesses been served by most brick-and-mortar financial institutions?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional banks have a one-size-fits-all system for everybody. They don&#8217;t have a personalized approach to small business banking—and that doesn&#8217;t work in the world of small business. Every single small business, even within sub-industries, is very, very different, just like Sam&#8217;s is different from any other restaurant. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>If you want to offer any type of financial services, it&#8217;s very important that you know your customers and get as much information about them as possible so that you can tailor an approach that will work specifically for them and their business. </em></strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many large, traditional financial institutions lack the technology or the infrastructure to do that. Plus, generally speaking, they are less willing to take on risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics show that in 2019, only about 27% of small business owners actually got approved for a small business loan by big banks. And that&#8217;s after having to submit a very </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/business-financing-options/bank-loans/#:~:text=Bank%20Loan%20Details&amp;text=And%20applying%20also%20takes%20serious,funds%20to%20expand%20your%20business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy paperwork process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often 30 to 40 pages, and going through an underwriting process, which in most cases takes from weeks to months to complete and get an answer. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>With all those forms they review, you’d think banks would have a better understanding of their borrowers. Where is the disconnect?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they&#8217;ve seen a ton of small businesses, typically these lenders haven&#8217;t done a good job of collating the information they received from these businesses, so they don&#8217;t have a holistic view of things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the guy who actually had to collect these documents and often the one underwriting the loans. So this became the issue that was top of mind for me and I started to think about where I could make a better impact for small businesses. That’s when I quit the big bank and joined Fundbox about four years ago.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Tell us about your evolution at Fundbox and how you started helping small businesses get credit.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of Fundbox’s first underwriters for our highest limits program, my job was to come in and develop an understanding and a strategy of how to give people access to loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously we could not have 40-page applications because we’re not like a big bank. We wanted to fix that pain point, to remove those obstacles from small business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how could we still do this? Theoretically, it’s the same underwriting process, but we do it a ton simpler. For example, our application was only one page long. We also put a ton of emphasis on actually speaking to the customer and getting to know their specific business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our early process was kind of this middle ground between a traditional underwriting approach and where we wanted to go—which was to develop a holistic algorithm that puts more emphasis on data points that traditional banks don&#8217;t even look at. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hands-on, small business underwriting experience helped Fundbox to develop and make our algorithms smarter, because over time, as you&#8217;re looking at hundreds of small businesses, you start to see that certain individual data points matter more than others. That’s just one reason why our algorithm helps make credit decisions possible in minutes, instead of weeks.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>In what you’ve learned as a small business owner and working at Fundbox, what are three quick tips you can offer other businesses?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The number one tip is to solve one problem at a time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plugging all the holes at the same time is tempting but it’s not possible. Whatever the biggest problem is at that moment, solve that one and then move on to the next. </span></p>
<p><b>The second tip is to be a nice person.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s probably an under-appreciated one, but that&#8217;s going to affect your day-to-day life in everything you do as a small business owner. Be nice in how you deal with vendors, how you deal with customers, how you deal with employees, and even lenders. Niceness has a mushroom effect. Your customers and employees will be more loyal. Even your vendors’ deliveries may be prioritized over people that are not as nice as you. </span></p>
<p><b>Third, find a way to personally engage with your customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sam&#8217;s personal touch advantage has been a challenge to adapt to this new reality of social distancing, so social media has become a great way to pick up the slack. We try to engage with the people who follow us so that they can at least continue to be reminded of who we are and what we mean to the City. People want to have those conversations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are ready to fully open up again, it&#8217;s going to go right back to that because people want to come and they want to get to know you and talk and share their own stories. That&#8217;s going to come back. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Thank you Emad, and congratulations on your recognition as a legacy business in San Francisco. We’re hoping the next 50 years ahead for Sam’s Burgers will be as warm and successful as your first 50 years.</h3>

In fact, since you don’t have staff headcount, payroll, and benefits to calculate, your application process (for the loan and later for forgiveness) should be much simpler.</span></p>
<p>As of December 27, 2020, Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as a sole proprietor, the PPP loan can provide you with funds equivalent to your <em>pre-pandemic</em> gross earnings over 2.5 months (or 3.5 months if your business is in the food services or accommodations industry)—based on a comparative period from 2019 (or the first 2.5 months of 2020 if your business began in 2020).<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use a portion of this loan to cover some </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operational expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business (like business-related rent, utilities, or interest payments on a mortgage or other business loans, and certain business-related supplies or repairs). However, if you want to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">qualify for loan forgiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these operational expenses can only account for up to 40% of your total loan amount. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Can You Expect to Borrow?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most independent contractors, calculating your PPP borrowing limit is a 3-step process: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Find line 7</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (gross income) on your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (If you haven’t filed yet for 2019, go ahead and fill it out). If the amount on Line 7 is over $100,000, write $100,000.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Effective March 8, 2021, most lenders will now accept line 7 (gross income instead of line 31, net income, as previously required).</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If line 7 shows $0 or less, you do not qualify for a PPP loan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the amount from Step 1 by 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiply the amount from Step 2 by 2.5 (or 3.5 if your business is in the food services or accommodation industry, with a <a href="https://www.naics.com/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAICS code</a> starting with 72). For most borrowers, this will be your<a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP%20--%20How%20to%20Calculate%20Maximum%20Loan%20Amounts%20for%20First%20Draw%20PPP%20Loans%20%281.17.2021%29-508.pdf"> maximum PPP loan amount</a>.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: If you received an EIDL loan between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 you can refinance that as part of your PPP loan (minus any amount received as an EIDL grant).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how you can spend your PPP loan</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace your compensation (based on your 2019 or 2020 income)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay interest payments on a mortgage or loan (such as an auto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">loan) you use to perform your business*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business rent payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business utility payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make interest payments on any other debt incurred before February 15, 2020 (but such amounts are not eligible for loan forgiveness)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li>Operations expenses for business software and cloud computing services and other human resources and accounting needs that facilitate business operations</li>
<li>Payments to a supplier for goods that are essential to the operations of the borrower pursuant to a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed or with respect to perishable goods</li>
<li>Property damage costs related to looting due to public disturbances in 2020 that are not covered by insurance or other compensation</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*You must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 or 2020 taxes for expenses described in 2, 3, and 4 above. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s What You’ll Need to Apply for a PPP Loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your lender is accepting PPP applications, the following documentation will be needed. <em>Please note that specific requirements and acceptable documents may vary depending on the lender. The SBA may issue further guidance, at which time these recommendations will be updated.</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3>1. Completed PPP Application Form</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is one <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP%20Borrower%20Application%20Form%20%28revised%201.8.2021%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">application form for first-time PPP loans</a> and a different <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP%20Second%20Draw%20Borrower%20Application%20Form%20%281.8.2021%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form for second draw PPP loans</a>.</li>
<li>Include your contact name and email address.</li>
<li>Indicate your Business Type (Independent Contractors and Sole Proprietors have slightly different document requirements).</li>
<li>Check Yes or No for all questions on the form.
<ul>
<li>If you answer Yes to questions 1,2, 5, or 6, you do not qualify for a PPP loan.</li>
<li>If you answer Yes to question 3 or 4, you may still qualify, but you must include an Addendum on a separate sheet explaining the details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Proof of Self Income</h3>
<p>For Independent Contractor/Self-Employed/Sole Proprietorship with no employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>2019 or 2020 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C. (If you are using 2020 to calculate the loan amount but you haven’t filed your 2020 taxes yet, you may provide a draft.</li>
<li>If you are the sole proprietor for multiple businesses, consider bundling all your businesses&#8217; revenue documents together and apply using a single PPP form to avoid separate applications from being flagged as duplicates under your Social Security Number. (Please consult your own legal, financial and accounting advisor to determine how to proceed.)</li>
<li>If you are including an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) that was taken from 1/31/20-4/3/20, provide a bank statement showing the deposit into your business account.</li>
<li>Invoice, bank statement, book of record, or a 1099 MISC that covered the period up to 2/15/2020.</li>
<li>Remember: as a sole proprietor, your PPP application won’t involve payroll calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Unexpired government-issued photo ID</h3>
<p>Along with your SSN, lenders will also require a government-issued ID such as a Passport or a state-issued Driver’s License.</p>
<h3>4. Voided check</h3>
<p>So the lender can deposit approved funds into your account, you may be asked to provide a voided check.</p>
<h3>5. Documents needed for proof of 25% revenue reduction (for a second draw PPP)</h3>
<p>If you’ve received and exhausted a previous first-time PPP loan, you may now qualify for a second draw PPP. You do not need to have received forgiveness for your first PPP loan (with few exceptions). In addition to the documents listed above, you will need one of the following (your choice) to demonstrate your income reduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>2019 and 2020 tax forms (IRS Form 1040 Schedule Cs).</li>
<li>2019 and 2020 quarterly income statements (for the same quarter for 2019 and 2020)</li>
<li>If the business started between 1/1/2020-2/15/2020, quarterly income statements or bank statements for Q2, Q3, or Q4 compared to Q1.</li>
<li>2019 and 2020 bank statements (for the same quarter for 2019 and 2020).</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Can Apply?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sole proprietor or independent contractor, you may be eligible for a PPP loan if all of the following are true:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You were already</span><b><i> in operation</i></b><b> on February 15, 2020. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(With very few exceptions, you can&#8217;t have started a business this March or April and expect to get PPP funds.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><b>primary place of </b><b><i>residence </i></b><b>is the United States</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (You don’t have to be a U.S. Citizen); </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business </span><b>has filed </b><b>a 2019 or 2020 tax return</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the IRS. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For independent contractors, this means a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2019 or 2020 showing self-employment income.</span></li>
<li>Entities with significant ties to China are ineligible for a second draw PPP loan.</li>
<li><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, to qualify, you must certify in good faith that </span><b>the loan is “necessary to support [your] ongoing operations.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” (In other words, PPP loans should be your only way of accessing needed money.)</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What If You Don&#8217;t Qualify for 100% Forgiveness?</span></h2>
<p><b>Amounts not forgiven simply convert into a 1% interest loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">payable over the next two years. There&#8217;s even a grace period. No payments would be required until the SBA remits the forgivable amount to your lender. </span>If you do not request forgiveness, you will not have to make any payments for 10 months<span style="font-weight: 400;"> following the date of disbursement of the loan. (However, interest will still accrue from the date loan was disbursed.)</span></p>

Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP, and the program will be open until May 31, 2021 or until funding runs out. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">.</span></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><em>The information discussed in this article was collected from a variety of external sources, and to the best of our knowledge, was correct as of December 28, 2020. Some of the PPP details have changed with the restart of the program, and we are awaiting final guidance from the SBA, at which time those details will be updated here. This content is for informational purposes only. Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide financial, legal, or accounting advice. You should consult your own financial, legal, or accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help explain the PPP loan,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here are updated answers to some key questions about the loan program, including necessary application documents, authorized uses for the loan, loan forgiveness, and special circumstances for independent contractors. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about a quick overview of the PPP program and what it means to small businesses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As we all know, due to closures and restrictions, the coronavirus has severely impacted the economy. This is especially true for small businesses and their employees, as well as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 27, the government passed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act—the CARES Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and on December 27, 2020, the Covid Relief Bill was added to renew financial assistance programs. These stimulus packages were designed to give financial relief to individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These acts include two loan options for businesses: the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP), and the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or EIDL. </span><b>This article focuses on just the PPP loan.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a PPP loan? What makes it different? Why should I be trying to take out yet another loan at a time like this?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PPP loan is a new program from the Small Business Administration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think it may be a disservice to call this program a loan. It&#8217;s more like a loan that converts to a grant, and it&#8217;s for small businesses—typically those with fewer than 500 employees—to help them maintain their employees and their payroll over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is hopefully the most significant business disruption. It&#8217;s unique in a few ways. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it&#8217;s </span><b>low interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just 1 percent. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, as the name implies, it&#8217;s</span><b> intended to support payroll costs (or self-employment income) and/or business operating expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like rent, mortgage interest, and some operation expenses. Qualified businesses can borrow up to $2 million at a 1% interest rate, calculated based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs, or 3.5 months if you’re in the food service or accommodation industry (businesses with a NAICS code starting with 72).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, and to some this is most important: it&#8217;s </span><b>potentially forgivable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, becoming a grant that you might not have to pay back—as long as you use the money from the loan according to the rules of the program. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is eligible to apply for a PPP loan, especially if I don&#8217;t have employees other than myself?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are basically eligible to apply for a PPP loan if you are a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or an </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/independent-contractors-guide-cares-act-relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">independent contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or other self-employed individual who has been harmed by the pandemic—as long as all of the following are true:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have 500 or fewer employees (300 or fewer if applying for a second draw PPP).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tangible net worth is under $15 million and the average net income for full two fiscal years prior to application does not exceed $5 million. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are not a publicly traded company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You were already</span><b> in-operation on February 15, 2020.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><b>primary place of residence is the United States</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (You have to be a U.S. Citizen).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has filed a 2019 tax return with the IRS. For independent contractors, this means a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2019 showing self-employment income. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, to qualify, you must certify in good faith that the loan is “necessary to support [your] ongoing operations.” (In other words, PPP loans should be your only way of accessing needed money.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>If applying for a second draw PPP loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you must also attest that:</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">You have 300 or fewer employees.</li>
<li aria-level="2">You have already spent all funds you received from your first PPP loan.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experienced a reduction of at least 25% in gross receipts during the first, second, third, or fourth quarter in 2020 relative to the same quarter in 2019.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has no significant ties to China.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some new </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may make you eligible for a PPP loan even if your business previously didn&#8217;t qualify for an SBA loan. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are operating as </span><b>a franchise, the normal affiliation rules do not apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (You&#8217;re counted on the size of the specific business location you own, not on the main franchisor&#8217;s numbers.)  </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I meet all the basic qualifications, are there some things that might still make me ineligible for a PPP loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some &#8220;yes&#8221; answers (like to questions 1, 2, 5, and 6) on the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP%20Borrower%20Application%20Form%20%28revised%201.8.2021%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as a few other stipulations may automatically disqualify you. For example, business owners may be ineligible because of delinquent child support obligations, engaging in illegal activities, or they&#8217;re in one of the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20Form%202234C%20app.%204-23-14_working.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">excluded industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as: farms or ranches, gambling, businesses of a prurient sexual nature, or lobbyists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, business partners who report self-employment income are not eligible to also apply for a PPP loan as self-employed individuals. A good rule-of-thumb is: </span><b>no double-dipping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s the first step someone should take to apply?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA does not lend money directly. It only guarantees loans provided through SBA-preferred financial institutions, such as banks, microlenders, and even some fintech companies. In order to get a PPP loan, </span><b>you have to apply through a financial institution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which then submits the application to the SBA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So your first step could be to ask the financial institution you do your business banking with if they are an approved PPP lender, and if they are accepting PPP applications. If your business bank is not an approved SBA lender, you need to find a lender now. You can find a state-by-state list of approved lenders on the </span><a href="http://sba.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>SBA.gov</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you learn that your business&#8217;s bank or credit union is not an approved lender—</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SBA can help you find a lender</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the lender approves your application, it gets sent to the SBA for approval and then it’s time to cross your fingers and hope you get approved before May 31, 2021 or before the next round of funding is exhausted, whichever comes first. If you are lucky enough to get your application approved before the funds run out, </span><b>you will get notification (usually by email) to sign final agreements, you&#8217;re then issued an SBA loan number, and then payment is electronically deposited into your business bank account within 10 days.</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can I do to maximize my chance of getting approved for the loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it&#8217;s important to act fast, since these loans are considered on a first-come-first-served basis. The SBA does not weigh the merits of one business over another. Unfortunately, </span><b>the program is not set up to even allow for essential services—or businesses helping essential services—to take priority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s mostly a matter of timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are some things you can do to help ensure your success. Some businesses fail because they </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/common-mistake-small-businesses-make-applying-for-loans-says-sba-official.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make common mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fail to do their homework, or they&#8217;re </span><b>missing some critical documents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of some of the documents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you&#8217;ll  want to have at your fingertips. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Please note: every lender is different, and this list may be incomplete and will be updated once we receive final guidance from the SBA and our lending partner.</em></span></span></p>

Such forms may include: Form 940, Form 941, Form 944, and your payroll processor records if you have employees. For sole proprietors and independent contractors, you&#8217;ll need your Form 1099s and Form 1040 (at least the completed Schedule C, in case you haven&#8217;t filed yet).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof of </span><b>mortgage or rent, mortgage interest, and utility expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your business owns or works out of a vehicle that you&#8217;re making payments on, have these records handy too. Even if they&#8217;re not asked for during the application process, such records may help with calculating or proving figures for potential loan forgiveness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Articles of Incorporation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ Organization. Make sure to list the established date.</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For details on these documents and a complete list of what the SBA and/or your lender will want you to provide, please see our Fundbox blog article on the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP Application Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain the $100,000 salary cap for employee wages.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 100K limit is for calculating what loan amount and forgiveness you&#8217;re eligible for. For any individual employee who makes an annual salary over $100,000, you can only claim (and receive forgiveness for) a loan amount of what they&#8217;d make during 2.5 months (or 3.5 months if in the Food Services or Accommodations industry) as if they only had a salary of $100,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So no matter if their actual annual salary is $100,000 or $110,000 or even $150,000 per year, the SBA may only loan and forgive you for up to 2.5 (or 3.5) months of their salary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does loan forgiveness mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 100% of the PPP loan is forgivable if you follow certain requirements around payroll and employee retention during a loan forgiveness “covered period” of either 8 weeks or 24 weeks. Now all businesses have a choice between using an 8-week or 24-week covered period on which to base the forgiveness calculation (including retroactively for previous PPP loan recipients). This choice depends on how long you wish to pay your employees while being held to the criteria for forgiveness, as explained below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These forgiveness rules are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>60% of the money for payroll costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a period of 8 weeks or 24 weeks—beginning on the day the PPP funds were deposited in your business bank account. To qualify for full forgiveness, the remaining loan funds (up to 40%) must be spent on eligible non-payroll business costs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For both a first-time or second draw PPP, your loan </span><b>forgiveness can be reduced</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if—during your 8- or 24-week forgiveness period—you have:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced the number of employees, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced employee salaries by more than 25% </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: Certain </b><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_ppp_forgiveness-guide.pdf"><b>safe harbors</b></a><b> that apply that can exempt you from retention and wage related forgiveness penalties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as in situations when an employee refused to accept an offered position.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Forgiveness is not automatic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You must apply to your lender for forgiveness. However, if your loan was for less than $150,000, the SBA will provide a simplified one-page application process for loan forgiveness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you also receive or received an EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) advance from the SBA, your amount of PPP loan forgiveness </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will not be reduced</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the amount of the EIDL advance. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Here’s how it works: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an employer and keep your employees for 8 (or 24) weeks from the time your loan is originated and maintain their salaries, the SBA will forgive the portion of the loan you used to cover payroll, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities, as long as at least 60% of the loan funds were spent on payroll, and that the remaining funds were spent on qualified business expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple caveats, though. For instance, as The Chamber of Commerce’s </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can’t factor in the salaries of employees who live outside the United States when calculating payroll.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is loan forgiveness automatic? Is the whole loan forgiven? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan forgiveness is not automatic, and it may not cover 100% of the loan if you don&#8217;t follow the rules. You must apply to your lender for forgiveness. However, the SBA will now provide a </span><b>simplified one-page </b><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form-3508-paycheck-protection-program-loan-forgiveness-application"><b>forgiveness application</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if your loan was for less than $150,000.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What &#8220;payroll costs&#8221; are forgivable?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salary, wages, commissions, or tips (capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee benefits including costs for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave; allowance for separation or dismissal; payments required for the provisions of group health care benefits including insurance premiums; and payment of any retirement benefit</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local taxes assessed on compensation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a sole proprietor or independent contractor: replacing your compensation (wages, commissions, or gross earnings from self-employment, based on your 2019 or 2020 income and capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember, the intent of this PPP loan is to keep employees in their jobs and/or to cover actual business operational expenses. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you lay off any of your employees within the eight-week time period or cut wages by more than 25% for individual employees who already earn under $100,000 a year, your loan forgiveness amount may be reduced, according to the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA&#8217;s guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, there are other factors that may count towards your payroll expenses. For example, if you increased employee wages or compensation during the eight-week period—by covering employee tips, for example—you may be eligible for additional loan forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another benefit is that you can bring back any employees you’ve already laid off to be eligible for the loan. You won’t be penalized for re-hiring employees or reinstating their original wages as long as you keep them on payroll for the designated 8 or 24 weeks. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What &#8220;non-payroll costs&#8221; are forgivable?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP funds may be forgiven if they make up no more than 40% of your total loan amount and are qualifying expenses related to your business during your chosen covered 8 or 24 week period. Such expenses may include these costs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business mortgage interest payments* </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest payments on a loan (such as an auto loan) needed to perform your business*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business rent and lease payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business utility payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operations expenses for business software and cloud computing services and other human resources and accounting needs that facilitate business operations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to a supplier for goods that are essential to the operations of the borrower pursuant to a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed or with respect to perishable goods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worker protection expenditures required to comply with public health guidance related to COVID-19 (such as personal protective equipment, drive-through windows, and sneeze guards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property damage costs related to looting due to public disturbances in 2020 that are not covered by insurance or other compensation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*If you are self-employed, you must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 taxes for expenses indicated with an asterisk above to be forgiven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business expenses paid for using PPP funds are now tax deductible. This applies to past and future PPP loans. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if a 1% interest loan sounds like a good deal? What if a business wants to borrow more than they know they can be forgiven for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can only borrow funds and use them for </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP--IFRN%20FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorized purposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those purposes are payroll and associated costs, rent/mortgage interest, and utilities. That’s it. If you use the funds for anything else you’re in violation of the loan agreement and the SBA may penalize you.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not more than 40% of the loan can be used for non-payroll purposes.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 60% of the loan proceeds have to be used for payroll purposes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If PPP funds are used for unauthorized purposes, SBA will direct the borrower to repay those amounts however they do not say how quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If PPP funds are knowingly used for unauthorized purposes, the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbfreeman/2020/04/09/five-things-every-paycheck-protection-program-borrower-should-do-after-receiving-a-loan/#550c2e076170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">borrower may be subject to additional liability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as charges for fraud.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there is now a need to certify that the loan is &#8220;necessary&#8221; for business continuity. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the borrower can demonstrate that 60% of the proceeds were used for payroll, then the entire loan will be forgiven. What remains unclear—and for which we are awaiting guidance from the SBA—is what sort of documentation will be required to support that 60%, and whether SBA will also ask for verification of how the remainder of the funds were used.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the CARES Act covers two types of loans, can I apply for both the PPP loan and an EIDL?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you’re allowed to apply for both the paycheck protection loan and disaster loan. However, you can’t use both loans for the same purpose. If you received an EIDL between January 31, 2020 and the time when the PPP loans are available, you’re still eligible for a PPP loan as long as you didn’t use your EIDL for payroll costs. Again, no double dipping.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I don&#8217;t have a payroll, how much can I borrow as an independent contractor?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most independent contractors, calculating your PPP borrowing limit is a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-step process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Find line 7</strong> (gross income) on your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (If you haven’t filed yet for 2019, go ahead and fill it out). If the amount on Line 7 is over $100,000, write $100,000.  <em>Effective March 8, 2021, most lenders will now accept line 7 (gross income instead of line 31, net income, as previously required).</em></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the amount from Step 1 by 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiply the amount from Step 2 by 2.5 (or 3.5 if your business is in the Food Services or Accommodations industry). For most borrowers, this will be your <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP%20--%20How%20to%20Calculate%20Maximum%20Loan%20Amounts%20for%20First%20Draw%20PPP%20Loans%20%281.17.2021%29-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum PPP loan amount</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: If you received an EIDL loan between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 you can refinance that as part of your PPP loan (minus any amount received as an EIDL grant).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sole proprietor and independent contractor, what can I use the PPP loan for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independent Contractor&#8217;s Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to CARES Act Relief, you can use your PPP loan to do any of the following:</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace </span><b>your compensation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (based on your 2019 income)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay</span><b> interest payments on a mortgage or loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (such as an auto loan) you use to perform your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business </span><b>rent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business </span><b>utility </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make interest payments on any other</span><b> prior debt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> incurred before February 15, 2020. (However, such prior debt payments amounts are not eligible for loan forgiveness.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to a supplier for goods that are essential to your operations, as long as a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed, or with regard to perishable goods (like many foods)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to claim a loan or request forgiveness on loan interest, rent, or utilities payments, you must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 taxes for those expenses. That&#8217;s another reason why you need to complete your Schedule C for your 2019 Form 1040, even if you haven&#8217;t filed your  taxes yet.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some banks said they have massive demand and asked applicants to go elsewhere. What does it mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many banks have allocated a certain amount of capital that they allocated toward SBA PPP loans. Some banks may be approaching that threshold. In which case they might turn some customers away. If that’s the case, there are other options beyond your bank. There’s a network of agents that work to connect business owners with banks that are eager to work with small businesses and help them get SBA PPP loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing is to understand why your application was declined. Earlier we touched on eligibility requirements. But here are a few additional, more detailed reasons why you may be rejected:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are engaging in any illegal activity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a household employer (your payroll goes toward childcare, cleaning services, or other domestic services)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An owner of 20% or more of the business is incarcerated on probation, on parole, subject to indictment, criminal information, arraignment, or other means by which formal criminal charges are brought in any jurisdiction, or has been convicted of a felony in the last five years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You or your business or any business controlled by you or your owners has ever defaulted on an SBA loan in the last seven years </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the reason was something else, like you didn’t fill out the application properly, then you should reapply. But this time, go through the application carefully and make sure you attach all the required documents and don’t skip any steps.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the 8- or 24 week forgiveness period is over, what if I have money remaining even after having used the funds for payroll and bills? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those remaining funds, or any funds not found to be eligible for forgiveness, turn into a loan at the 1% rate, payable within 2 years.</span></p>

Based in our Dallas, Texas area office, but working from home like the rest of us during the COVID-19 pandemic since March, Marlena explains what&#8217;s important to her about helping small business customers, working at Fundbox, and even fostering allyship and diversity throughout the company.</span></em></p>

<h3><b>First of all, tell us a bit about what you do for Fundbox.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Marlena Stallworth: </strong>I was hired in May, 2019 as an Onboarding Specialist, helping customers to potentially acquire a Fundbox line of credit for their business. These are people who&#8217;ve input their information to the application process but haven&#8217;t completed it. Generally that&#8217;s going to be for one or two reasons: either they&#8217;re uncertain about the product or they want somebody to walk them through the technical questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are some typical questions people have when applying for a line of credit?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes our prospective customers ask themselves, &#8220;Do I even need this?&#8221; They may be concerned about what terms we have to offer and how they would work into their business&#8217;s other ongoing payment cycles. Is this really a good fit? Getting clarity on eligibility requirements is pretty common. Will applying affect their credit score? (It won&#8217;t.) Or, if they&#8217;re looking at how to calculate the interest rate on their own, that part might be a little confusing; that&#8217;s because our loans are for only 12 or 24 weeks, not for 12 months, so APR (annual percentage rate) really doesn&#8217;t represent an accurate reflection of what we offer. </span></p>
<h3><b>What did you learn in your first few months that made you so successful? You&#8217;re now the onboarding team lead.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, sometimes we&#8217;d make maybe 80 to 100 calls, and to me, when you spread that level of activity across a day, I would beg to question what was the quality of the actual conversation. How well were we really taking the time to help each customer? So the next couple months I really thought about how to develop better strategies—not just in terms of the calls, but for all touch points, like emails and the application itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like some of the questions we were asking were a little too generalized. And so I worked really hard at getting those conversations to be a bit more personable because I was trying really hard to get people to trust us more as agents for them, not just as reps for Fundbox. Credit is a very personal thing. It can be a very emotional process—because it&#8217;s your small business and your money, and sometimes even your employees&#8217; livelihoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by taking more time on these phone calls. If the average customer phone call was just a few minutes, mine was maybe 12 to 15. Sometimes I would learn about people&#8217;s family members, how many cats they have, how long they&#8217;ve been in business, and what their plans are for the future of the business. It would start to make sense why having a kind of safety net in your back pocket would be good for all the things that matter to you at the core of your heart and your business.</span></p>
<h3><b>How did your background and career path before Fundbox prepare you for what you&#8217;re doing today? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In college I minored in dance, which was my passion since I was three, and I majored in English Education—because I love to communicate with people and tend to get acquainted with people easily. This seemed like the natural course, since I have a lot of educators in my family. But I quickly learned the business aspect of education didn&#8217;t mesh well with me from an emotional standpoint, with all the bureaucracy and different political views within the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead, I got into retail as a manager for a long time. It was there that I realized I just really loved people! From a professional standpoint, that kind of led the way for me. Selling things or services to people, whether it&#8217;s a wardrobe or a life insurance plan, is all about figuring out how this is going to benefit them. I&#8217;d think, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get to know you so well, you&#8217;re going to trust me with your life.&#8221; And I never shied away from that concept ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent years in banking, starting back about maybe 12 or 13 years ago. That exposure to investment bankers is what really got me really interested in life insurance. I&#8217;ve maintained my license to solicit life insurance and annuities. I think having those tough, detailed conversations with families about what their needs are, whether business or domestic customers, is where I learned to develop more thorough customer correspondence. People want to work through the process. That human aspect is greatly appreciated by customers. I realized working for smaller banks, this acute attention is rarely seen in larger lending institutions. Smaller firms train their people to get to know you better, and that same level of attention can be seen at Fundbox. </span></p>
<h3><b>What keeps you motivated, working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my manager(s) could tell you, the money is the smallest factor of motivation for me.  I generally use financial metrics to help motivate others. I firmly believe that when you are consistently doing what’s right by the customer, the numbers all fall in place. The process of understanding our customers is motivating in itself.  Employing great listening skills in order to remain keenly aware of why customers choose to work with Fundbox is imperative. Did they find us or were they referred to us? What helped them make that decision? What can we help resolve? How can we help you grow?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions aren’t merely asked for the purpose of completing a checklist. It&#8217;s really about building our relationship with that person and I have always been committed to having the conversation—whether it&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s a great fit, just a good fit, or not a good fit for us right now. At the end of the conversation, I always hoped prospective customers would feel like they were more educated no matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy meeting customers where they are and aligning recommendations based on what they’re trying to achieve. It’s important to build up a natural sensitivity to people where they are in circumstances. Having to flex that muscle has become really important during the pandemic because people are not only just facing the concept of how the pandemic is affecting their business; now it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s affecting their family. Some people just really need to hear that they’re not alone, we&#8217;re here for them and remain very grateful for their continued business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Helping applicants become new customers isn&#8217;t all you do for Fundbox. You&#8217;re also improving awareness, allyship, and corporate culture here by leading an employee resource group. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several instances of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">injustice against Black people have recently come to the forefront on various social platforms. We know for certain that current racial conditions are not going to improve by one community acting on its own. We know now more than ever that we all need each other to truly see continuous progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the death of George Floyd, the executive and human resources teams approached me and Jordan Eldridge, our Sales Enablement Manager, regarding having an open discussion with the company. It was definitely important to get a real pulse check of our staff’s feelings around racial disparity and inequality. We followed through by leading four segments of discussions in a Round-table forum. This was particularly imperative since we have many employees of different demographics in very different regions of the world, between California, Texas, and Israel. These discussions gave us an opportunity to really gain a respect for the outlook and perspectives of each individual. We need to work as a people, as Americans, not just black, not just white, not just Latin, whomever—we all need to work together to make a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First we started the #Allyship channel on Slack [our internal online message board], which allowed us as employees to have an outlet to exchange information across the board, sharing different perspectives so that everybody could see our experiences and continue to learn from one another. Then we developed the Employee Resource Group, forming three different teams: The Pride group,  the Women at Fundbox, and The Melanin Collective. </span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about The Melanin Collective group, which you lead at Fundbox.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name,  Melanin Collective, is very important because sharing perspectives across cultural demographics is a pivotal aspect. Black culture is embraced and celebrated by people of all communities. We want to impress upon our members that we are all a “Collective of Melanin”; all humans are of color. Moving forward and progressing from a systemic aspect, we all have to continue to do this together. As a group, The Melanin Collective is working to bring many benefits to Fundbox. We strive to identify and help develop internal leaders within Fundbox in an effort to bridge the gap to see more Black leaders represented in our company. Our efforts will lead to higher retention rates as we continue to educate staff  through internal events, panels and more. In the upcoming season, our staff will be growing tremendously. We are working to recruit underrepresented individuals and develop a diverse pipeline of remarkable talent. </span></p>
<h3><b>What advice do you have for anyone else who&#8217;s considering working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an open mind and be flexible because even after 8 years, there is still a lot of the startup feel. Change is sometimes the highest constant, especially this year. You should be comfortable with maybe wearing more than one hat at the same time on any given day. I think that that will lead people to a lot of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, be yourself. I particularly love Fundbox because I get to bring myself. I not only get to be my true self, my unique personality is genuinely appreciated here. I think that&#8217;s the one thing that really stands out if I compare my career experiences. I feel that what is so appreciated about my skill set has a lot to do with my soft skills and integrity, not merely the book-sense and credentials that I brought to the job. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1563625450-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Closeup of Benjamin Franklin portrait on a hundred dollar bill among other bills on a desk as seen through a magnifying glass held by a businessman." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1563625450-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_1563625450.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Covid Relief Bill signed into law in December, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been reactivated. Eligible small business owners and self-employed individuals can now apply for a first-time or second draw PPP loan—through May 31, 2021 or until PPP funds run out. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">. </span></strong>Some important changes have been made to the PPP, and this article explains the basics of the loan and what’s new or different due to the new law.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">While correct to the best of our knowledge at the time of this publication, details shown here may change once the Small Business Administration (SBA) issues further guidance. </span></i></p>
<h2>Quick overview of the PPP loan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established to relieve small businesses (including sole proprietors and independent contractors) who have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, the PPP can provide 1% interest loans up to $2 million (the limit used to be $10 million). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculated primarily on your 2019 or 2020 average payroll (based on the year being used to calculate the maximum loan amount) or gross revenue for 2.5 months (or 3.5 months for some industries), these loans are up to 100% forgivable—as long as: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% or more of the money is used for employee (or self-employed) compensation;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 40% is used for qualified business costs, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other rules including wage and employee retention are followed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these PPP basics remain generally the same, the program has been expanded to allow more small businesses to take advantage of the loan, to provide more funding to some of the hardest-hit industries, and to make forgiveness easier. Most of these changes apply retroactively to prior PPP loans.</span></p>
<h2>Second draw PPP loans now available</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business received a PPP loan in 2020 and have already exhausted that funding, you may be able to apply for second PPP loan if:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has fewer than 300 employees</span></li>
<li aria-level="1">You have exhausted all funds obtained from a previous PPP loan. (Forgiveness not required to apply.)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has experienced a <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-second-draw-ppp-loans-how-calculate-revenue-reduction-maximum-loan-amounts-including-what" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduction of at least 25%</a> in gross revenue during any quarter in 2020 relative to the same quarter in 2019</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business does not have significant ties to China </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.5 months of funds for some industries</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most small businesses, PPP loan amounts are based on average monthly payroll costs (or gross revenue if self-employed)—from an equivalent period of 2.5 months in 2019 or 2020. <strong>For seasonal employers</strong>, the maximum amount of new PPP loans is based upon 2.5 times the average monthly payroll costs for the 12-week that begins February 15, 2019 or March 1, 2019 and ends February 15th, 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, acknowledging that some business types like restaurants and hotels may have suffered to an even greater extent during the economic downturn, amounts for new PPP loans can be calculated at 3.5 months if your business in the Food Services or Accommodations industry (businesses with a <a href="https://www.naics.com/search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAICS code</a> starting with 72).</span></p>
<p>For seasonal employers, the maximum amount of new PPP loans is based upon 2.5 times the average monthly payroll costs for the 12-week that begins February 15, 2019 or March 1, 2019 and ends February 15th, 2020. The loan can be for up to, but not exceeding, $2 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee earnings calculations still have a $100,000 annual cap, so gross payroll costs are not to exceed $8,333 per month per worker. </span></p>
<h2>More business types are eligible</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As before, first-time PPP loans are </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/Top-line%20Overview%20of%20First%20Draw%20PPP%20%281.8.2021%29-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with fewer than 500 employees. Also, a small business can only qualify if it has a maximum tangible net worth of under $15 million and the average net income for full 2 fiscal years prior to application does not exceed $5 million. If you are a publicly traded company, you are prohibited from receiving a loan. </span></p>
<p><b>With the new law, there are now some exceptions to these special size rules that may still make you eligible:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the accommodation and food services sector (NAICS 72), the 500-employee limit is applied on a per physical location basis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are operating as a franchise or receive financial assistance from an approved Small Business Investment Company the normal affiliation rules do not apply </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses that have minority shareholders (private equity or venture capital) can still qualify if those shareholders relinquish rights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the usual SBA exclusions of eligible business types remain, the new law expands the categories of businesses </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SBA%20Form%202234C%20app.%204-23-14_working.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a PPP loan. For example, the PPP now invites small nonprofits, local newspapers, and TV and radio broadcasters. As long as you meet the SBA size standards mentioned above, you may qualify if you are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sole proprietor, independent contractor, or self-employed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tribal business concern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(3) organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(6) organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(19) Veterans organization </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A housing cooperative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local news media outlets, including newspaper, radio or TV station</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help improve the equitable distribution of PPP funds, the new law has set aside $35 billion for first time borrowers. Another $15 billion is set aside for employers with 10 or fewer employees or for loans less than $250,000 for entities located in a low-income neighborhood.</span></p>
<h2>Broader, simpler loan forgiveness</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA will forgive 100% of the loan as long as you use at least 60% of the money for payroll costs within a period of 8 weeks or 24 weeks—beginning on the day the PPP funds were deposited in your business bank account. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for full forgiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the remaining loan funds (up to 40%) must be spent on eligible non-payroll business costs. The changes listed below are retroactive to prior or current PPP loans.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s what’s new when it comes to PPP loan forgiveness:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>You can choose either 8-weeks or 24-weeks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the covered period on which to base your forgiveness calculation (including previous PPP loan recipients). This is useful if you wish to maximize forgiveness based on how long your PPP funds lasted for how long you were able to retain all employees at full pay.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Simplified application for most borrowers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While forgiveness is not automatic (you have to apply through your PPP lender), the SBA will now provide a simplified one-page forgiveness application if your loan was for less than $150,000.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no longer reduces loan forgiveness if you received an EIDL advance from the SBA. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tax deductible business expenses. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualified non-payroll business costs paid for using PPP funds are now tax deductible.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Forgivable &#8220;non-payroll costs&#8221; may now include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business mortgage interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments* </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Interest payments on a loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (such as an auto loan) needed to perform your business*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business rent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and lease payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business utilities </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Operations expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for business software and cloud computing services and other human resources and accounting needs that facilitate business operations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Payments to a supplier for goods</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are essential to the operations of the borrower pursuant to a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed or with respect to perishable goods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Worker protection expenditures</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required to comply with public health guidance related to COVID-19 (such as personal protective equipment, drive-through windows, and sneeze guards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Property damage costs related to looting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to public disturbances in 2020 that are not covered by insurance or other compensation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*If you are self-employed, you must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 or 2020 taxes for expenses indicated with an asterisk above to be forgiven.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a fixed interest rate 1%, unforgiven amounts of PPP loans issued before June 5, 2020 are due in two years from the date or origination. If issued after June 5th, 2020, loans are due in five years. </span></p>
<h2>Here are some additional changes to the PPP</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law also provides these new benefits that may apply to your business:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employee Retention Tax Credit.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Employers can now also receive both the Employee Retention Tax Credit and a PPP loan—as long as they are not used to cover the same payroll expenses. The new refundable tax credit is 70% on $10,000 in wages per quarter (or a maximum $14,000 per employee from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021), and eligibility is now expanded to include employers who experienced a decline of more than 20% a quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019. (See the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/guide-small-business-covid-19-emergency-loans#two" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guide to the ERTC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Group insurance payments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be included in your payroll costs when determining your maximum loan amount</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Seasonal employers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now have greater flexibility in picking the 12-week period between February 15, 2019 and February 15, 2020 used to determine your payroll costs and thus your maximum loan amount. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Gross income (Line 7 on schedule C)</strong> will now be accepted by most lenders for PPP loan calculations (effective on March 8, 2021), instead of Line 31 (net income) as previously required.</li>
</ul>

Historically, Minority-owned (in particular Black-owned) businesses have faced the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/federal-reserve-banks-small-business-credit-survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most difficulty when it comes to securing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially during the start-up phase. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2018 report, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/minority-entrepreneurs-at-tipping-point-as-black-owned-banks-dwindle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SBA found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that &#8220;Reliance on personal and family savings are the most common sources of financing, especially among Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. However, Black households’ median net worth is about a tenth of that of White households.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an entrepreneur of color and you’ve found traditional financing hasn&#8217;t worked for you, here&#8217;s a comprehensive guide covering a wide number of current financing options and other resources intended to help Black and other </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-minorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority-owned small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (often including start-ups), ranging from Minority small business loans, to grants, to venture capitalists, to educational scholarships, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for minorities</span></h2>
<p><b>SBA Community Advantage (7a)</b> <b>Loans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the 7(a) loan umbrella, the SBA offers the Community Advantage Loans program, which is designed to support businesses and entrepreneurs that operate in underserved markets. Unlike many other loans, these are available only through specific </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/Programs/cdfi-program/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community-based lenders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are enrolled in the program. Minority business owners are guaranteed up to <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/CA%20Guide%20Version%206%20FINAL%20508%2006-01-20.pdf">75% for a $250,000 loan</a>, with interest rates of Prime + 6%.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If used for working capital, qualified businesses generally have 10 years to repay the loan, plus interest. This program has been extended until September 30, 2022.</span></p>
<p><b>SBA Microloan</b> <b>program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Available to almost anyone, SBA </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to help small businesses and others start up and expand—especially those that are owned by minorities, women, and </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/district/pa/pittsburgh/resources/sba-business-loan-information-veterans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veterans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SBA Microloans offer $500 to $50,000 (the average loan being $13,000) and must be repaid within 6 years, with interest rates averaging between 8% and 13%.</span></p>
<p><b>SBA&#8217;s 8(a) Business Development Program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Created to serve economically and socially disadvantaged businesses, </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SBA 8(a) program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (while not a loan itself, per se) offers a potential advantage to minority businesses by setting aside a certain percentage of federal contracting dollars for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged people or entities, thus limiting competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other government resources for minorities</span></h2>
<p><b>Community Development Financial Institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include more than 950 banks, credit unions, and other lenders who can access and distribute US Treasury Department funds that are specially-earmarked for minority and economically distressed communities. The </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDFI Fund&#8217;s searchable database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can direct you to certified CDFI lenders in your area who have received funds through such award programs as the Bank Enterprise Award Program (BEA) and Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian (NACA).</span></p>
<p><b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> (MBDA) Business Center.</strong> An agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/mbda-programs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBDA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “promotes the growth of minority-owned businesses”. They offer various </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/grants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted grants and loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> throughout the year, such as the “Entrepreneurship Education Program for Formerly Incarcerated Persons Grant” and an “Enterprising Women of Color Grant Competition.” They offer educational services too, such as </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/mbda-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBDA Business Centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, located around the country, to help advise Minority-owned firms seeking to grow, penetrate new markets, and learn about securing capital, competing for a contract, identifying a strategic partner, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>The National Minority Supplier Development Council Business Consortium Fund</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution, the </span><a href="https://bcfcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Consortium Fund (BCF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers minority business owners a variety of programs. Through their Direct Lending Program, minority business owners can borrow between $100,000 and $750,000, either in the form of a term loan or a business line of credit. To be eligible, you must </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-certified-minority-business-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certify your business as a minority business enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority Funds and Loans from Nonprofit and Private Organizations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous private companies and organizations who can provide funding alternatives for business owners of color.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Accion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit that offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority entrepreneurs term loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranging from $300 to $1,000,000 for both established businesses and start-ups, with fixed rates from 7% to 34% APR (depending on your credit score and other factors).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Consortium Fund</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BCF) Direct Lending Program caters to minority entrepreneurs who have been operating for 3 years but have been unable to secure financing through traditional channels. <a href="https://bcfcapital.com/loan-facilities/">Loans are available</a> from $100,000 to $750,000. Eligibility requires your business to be certified through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), but nonprofits are ineligible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Union Bank’s Business Diversity Lending Program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide </span><a href="https://www.unionbank.com/business/lending/diversity-lending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loans of up to $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to minority or women business owners. To be eligible, your company must be at least 51% minority, woman, or veteran owned, have been open for at least two years, and have annual sales below $20 million.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-level funding programs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More localized (and hence, less competitive) funding programs for minority and women-owned businesses may also be available in your area. For example: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://california.grantwatch.com/cat/53/minorities-grants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grants include more than 200 exclusive or well suited for minorities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.iowaeda.com/iowa-news/governor-reynolds-announces-2-million-in-cares-act-funding-for-covid-19-nanovaccine-development-in-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s Economic Development offers a Targeted Small Business Program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s Economic Development Authority offers a Small Business Fund</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business grants for Minorities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous business grants are available for Black and minority-owned businesses. Applying for a grant (particularly if it&#8217;s a federal grant) can be a very meticulous process, so here are some </span><a href="https://www.federalgrantswire.com/tips-on-applying-for-federal-grants.html#.X401N2hKiUk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tips for success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A good place to start looking for grants your business may be eligible for is to search for current programs listed on </span><a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Grants.gov</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of some minority-focused grants include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/rural-business-development-grants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural Business Development Grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to provide assistance to small rural businesses (with fewer than 50 new workers and less than $1 million in gross revenue), including nonprofits ($50,000 to $500,000).</span></li>

It&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated that $3.1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in receivables is owed to U.S. firms on any given day. The problem gets even worse when companies pay late. Improving cash flow is especially important during the COVID-19 economy. This need for quick cash has led many small businesses to consider invoice factoring — selling accounts receivable to an invoice factoring company at a discount, plus a fee. Besides being expensive, invoice factoring comes with other risks to your business. Here&#8217;s how factoring works, and how a line of credit may be a better alternative.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factoring is ancient history</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants and traders have been using a form of factoring since about 1754 B.C.E. (before the common era) in ancient Babylon, as </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hammurabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out in the Code of Hammurabi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a giant, black stone pillar detailing 282 rules governing commercial interactions, including establishing proper conduct, fines, and even eye-for-an-eye punishments. As early as 2000 years ago, Romans were believed to sell discounted promissory notes and hire third parties to settle their trade debts. </span></p>
<h6></h6>
<h6><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13652" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg" alt="code of Hammurabi" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
<em>A closeup of the text of the Code of Hammurabi written in stone.</em></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring, as a practice by name, began in England before the year 1400. Pilgrims brought it to America around 1620. </span><a href="https://www.openbusinesscouncil.org/the-history-of-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">English common law required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if a merchant wanted to sell invoices to a third-party for factoring, the debtor had to be notified. However, that requirement had fallen away by 1949, when most state governments in the U.S. had adopted rules so that merchants could make factoring arrangements without notifying the debtor. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why businesses use factoring</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that factoring has been a common B2B practice for more than 3,700 years means that it has to be good for something, right? Basically, it&#8217;s a way for small businesses to get cash sooner instead of waiting around for their clients to pay on net terms, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay past due</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or not at all. It also frees a company&#8217;s staff from the stress and workload of following up on collections. Understandably, however, this convenience comes at a price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard and hidden costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring brings several disadvantages to the businesses who use it. It can be much more expensive than other types of funding — taking a large chunk out of your profits — and it may even face you with other issues.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The cost.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The discount rate (or factor rate), depending on the factoring period, could range from 2% to 10% of the invoice. Plus, you may have to pay service fees, origination fees, credit check fees, or other fees added by the factoring company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The customer impression.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies may issue a Notice of Assignment and verify your invoices with the debtor. If this happens, your customers may question the stability of your business, since turning to factoring is often a tell-tale sign of cash flow problems, so they may consider switching to your competitor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The contracts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies require long-term contracts, forcing you to sign over a majority of your invoices, rather than just filling a short-term cash crunch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The control over your business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reduce their risk from customers who are likely to default, some factoring companies may even prevent you from working with specific accounts you had previously built relationships with.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better way to maintain cash flow while waiting to get paid</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have more options than factoring to avoid the cash flow problems of delayed payments, even in situations where you can&#8217;t ask your customers to pay by credit card. A </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit from Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with the financial breathing room to keep your operations going despite the peaks and valleys of irregular working capital that may come even when facing irregular payment on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">receivables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Best of all, this comes without your business having to offer a discount on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment, sell your invoices at a loss, or sacrifice your control or reputation with your valuable customers. </span></p>

After multiple rounds of federal funding that expired in August of 2020—but just renewed again on December 27th—how well has the the PPP serve minority businesses so far? According to some </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/coronavirus-ppp-may-have-left-minority-business-owners-behind.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, community leaders, and even </span><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/04/21/rep-meeks-on-how-small-business-funds-are-missing-minority-communities-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">members of Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: not well enough.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of December 27, 2020, Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span> </span></h4>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority businesses matter </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Minority Supplier Development Council (</span><a href="https://www.nmsdc.org/wp-content/uploads/Economic_Impact_Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NMSDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), there are more than 4 million minority-owned businesses, employing more than</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 million people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generating over</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 billion in annual revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-08/black-business-owners-suffer-41-drop-in-covid-19-lockdowns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bureau of Economic Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that the coronavirus shutdown has hurt African American businesses the most among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. </span><b>There was a 41% decline in black-owned businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to April, 2020. That was two months before this writing, and the economic impact still continues.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the PPP to those who need it most</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When its second round of PPP funding was signed into law in late April, nearly $60 billion was earmarked for small and medium sized financial institutions. However, the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/SBA_OIG_Report_20-14_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Inspector General&#8217;s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faulted the Small Business Administration&#8217;s initial guidance in fulfilling its promise to prioritize underserved communities for the PPP, writing, “These borrowers, including rural, minority and women owned businesses, may not have received the loans as intended.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without such guidance or accountability </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(and because demographic information is not collected as part of the PPP process, aside from the option to select Tribal business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), there were few tools to measure or enforce how well the PPP supported these minority communities. So the SBA dedicated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds to small financial institutions in the hope of reaching</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small, rural and minority-owned businesses. Their policy was to </span><a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/04/30/community-bank-helps-hundreds-of-small-businesses-access-ppp-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divide them evenly between financial institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with less than $10 billion in assets and those with $10 billion to $50 billion. These would include community banks, regional banks, credit unions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Treasury also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved the likelihood that PPP funds would be directed to smaller businesses more in need of assistance by adding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the requirement that applicants certify in good faith that they had no additional sources of capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new stipulation works in the favor of minority-owned businesses and entrepreneurs, who have characteristically lower access to capital and credit. “Black entrepreneurs are nearly three times more likely as white entrepreneurs to have business growth and profitability negatively impacted by a lack of capital,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/america-s-opportunity-gaps-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who report that 70.6% of Black entrepreneurs rely on personal and family savings.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for sole proprietors  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding resources for sole proprietors and independent contractors are especially critical, because minority business owners are less likely to employ workers. Statistics from the SBA show that </span><b>96% of black-owned businesses are non-employee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, versus 79% of white-owned businesses. The term &#8220;paycheck&#8221; in the title of the PPP may have caused some confusion among both banks and business owners as to the eligibility of self-employed persons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, 2020, the SBA and the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued final guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explaining how the PPP loan can work for sole proprietors and independent contractors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most independent contractors, calculating your PPP borrowing limit is a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-step process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Find line 7</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (gross income) on your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (If you haven’t filed yet for 2019, go ahead and fill it out). If the amount on Line 7 is over $100,000, write $100,000.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Effective March 8, 2021, most lenders will now accept line 7 (gross income instead of line 31, net income, as previously required).</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the amount from Step 1 by 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiply the amount from Step 2 by 2.5 (or 3.5 if your business is in the Food Services or Accommodations industry).

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress report on the PPP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://smallbusinessmajority.org/sites/default/files/research-reports/Survey-Small-business-owners-worried-about-PPP-loan-forgiveness.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2020 survey by the Small Business Majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported these findings on PPP applications up to May 27th:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63% of Black and Latino small business owners applied for a PPP loan (compared to 69% of all small businesses).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63% of those who applied were approved for financing (compared to 73% of all small businesses).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30% of all respondents who did not apply for the PPP said that they did not seek financing because they were concerned the loan would not be forgiven.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19% said they were told (or believed) they would not qualify.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12% could not find a bank to apply for a PPP loan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="http://publications.unidosus.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/2051/UnidosUS-Color-Of-Change-Federal-Simulus-Survey-Findings.pdf?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by UNIDOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found an even greater divide in PPP applications, with minorities asking for less funding than other businesses—and receiving even less than they sought. According to the May 2020 report:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51% of Black and Latinx small business owners who sought assistance requested less than $20,000 in temporary funding from the federal government. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12% received the assistance they requested. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41% reported receiving no PPP funds. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previously mentioned </span><a href="https://smallbusinessmajority.org/sites/default/files/research-reports/Survey-Small-business-owners-worried-about-PPP-loan-forgiveness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Majority study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that many of those who secured a loan expressed concerns with the program, with more than 80% concerned about the </span><b>rules around loan forgiveness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and having their loan forgiven. 58% specifically reported finding it challenging to spend at least 75%* of the loan on payroll. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[*Note: With the recent passage of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (PPPFA), this ratio of payroll/operating expenses has changed from 75%/25% to 60% payroll and 40% operating expenses to qualify for loan forgiveness. For details on these and other major changes to the PPP forgiveness rules, </span><b>check out our article or podcast on </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PPP Loan Forgiveness</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.]</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better future for the PPP?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential remains for Congress to renew the PPP. If so, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat can be done to help improve minority-owned small businesses access to these funds?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Signal-boost the PPP&#8217;s availability to sole proprietors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA&#8217;s move to open up and clarify the PPP for sole proprietors and independent contractors was a good first step, but more education and promotion efforts would help self-employed business owners, particularly in minority communities, to take advantage of the program.</span></b></li>
<li><strong>Identify and help promote the minority and community financial institutions</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ofn.org/CDFIs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDFIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as well as fintech lenders who are offering PPP loans. As the Small Business Majority revealed, 12% of businesses surveyed could not find a PPP lender. Adding to the difficulty of finding PPP lenders is the fact that </span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% of US households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (mostly minorities, and many of whom are self-employed) are either unbanked or underbanked, meaning they have only a basic checking/savings account or none.</span></li>
<li><strong>Simplify and improve education and clarity</strong> about the application and forgiveness process.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on previous surveys regarding experiences with the PPP (nearly one third did not apply because they did not understand forgiveness), one thing that could greatly help borrowers is to spread greater awareness and provide a much clearer understanding of the PPP rules for applications and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forgiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Much has been learned by PPP lenders like Fundbox that can improve your success in applying for a PPP loan, including </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required PPP application documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative Options for Small Business Owners</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For business owners looking for support outside of the PPP, there may be other avenues worth pursuing. See our updated list of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-business-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-by-State COVID-19 Resources for Small Businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Beginning your search at a state level may help decrease competition to receiving funding. For example, there are programs specifically designed to aid minority-owned businesses in Iowa (</span><a href="https://www.iowaeda.com/iowa-news/governor-reynolds-announces-2-million-in-cares-act-funding-for-covid-19-nanovaccine-development-in-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Economic Development: Targeted Small Business Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and New Jersey (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Economic Development Authority: Small Business Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><a href="https://www.opportunityfund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Opportunity Fund</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a nationwide source of microloans (as well as PPP loans) for underserved small businesses, particularly those owned by low- and moderate-income immigrants, people of color, and women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another source for small business resources, including mentoring, is </span><a href="https://www.score.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>SCORE.org</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for 500 years, America’s premier source of free business mentoring and education. Also look into the SBA&#8217;s </span><a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Office of Advocacy resources list</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Entrepreneurs, particular young minority business owners seeking advice or long-term consulting from volunteers in their respective fields, may find free mentoring through the </span><a href="https://www.skysthelimit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Sky&#8217;s the Limit</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you apply for a PPP loan or choose to take advantage of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/your-guide-to-business-financing-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other available funding resources for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, good luck, and stay safe.</span></p>
