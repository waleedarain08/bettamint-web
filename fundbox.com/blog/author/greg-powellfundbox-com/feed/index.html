However, using revenue and cash flow alone, he had to wait until reserves increased before he could hire. That’s when he started looking for a <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=blog_fluxaccounting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit</a>, to get away from this cyclical dilemma. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13740 alignleft" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChaseVowellBW.jpg" alt="Chase Vowell of Flux Accounting" width="242" height="363" style="width:242px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an avid QuickBooks user, he looked at the QuickBooks App Store for some ideas. That’s when he found Fundbox. Fundbox integrated into QuickBooks and had good reviews, so he decided to give it a try. “I remember onboarding being really easy. The setup with QuickBooks was seamless,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he was approved and started using Fundbox he was impressed. “The interface is extremely user friendly,” he said. “The sheer transparency is phenomenal, which is rare,” he added. As the leader of an accounting firm, he also cared about the QuickBooks integration. A lot. “I specifically appreciate the way that you can use Fundbox inside of QuickBooks. The integration is really clean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing for Chase and Flux Accounting is the impact that Fundbox has had on his business. “We’re now able to hire much earlier, so by the time we hit a busy period, our employees have already been trained and our clients don’t see a lapse in service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solutions like Fundbox are where Chase sees his practice moving in the future. “This is the future of cloud accounting,” he explained. “Everything ties to the accounting platform and you cut down on the manual work, so you can focus on the value-add consultation with your clients.”</span></p>
