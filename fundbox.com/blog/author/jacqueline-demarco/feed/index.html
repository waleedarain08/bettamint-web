Small business owners, on the other hand, eagerly await the Saturday in between those days.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows consumers to support small businesses during a time of year when many could benefit from a little extra support. Their deals may not be as flashy as your favorite big-box retailers, but shopping small can have a huge impact on a small business—especially amidst a pandemic.</span></p>
<h2>What is Small Business Saturday?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, during the Great Recession, American Express created a campaign designed to help support the small businesses that are such vital parts of our communities. The campaign created a movement called</span> <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/shop-small/about/?linknav=us-loy-shopsmall-footer-about"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the campaign encouraged consumers to focus on shopping small while checking off their holiday gift list. The cause was celebrated by shoppers and small business owners alike, and 12 years later, the movement is still going strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, small business owners open their shops and drive traffic to their websites by offering deals on both products and services that make great holiday gifts. Some neighborhood small businesses band together to create events surrounding their sales, and others run online promotions so you can shop your favorite small businesses from the comfort of your home.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 40px;">Why Shop Small Business Saturday?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet, you can now shop with small businesses regardless of your location, but one of the main purposes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was to encourage consumers to shop with local businesses. When you shop locally, you help support both small business owners and your greater community as a whole. Your purchases can help create local employment opportunities, bring tax dollars to your neighborhood, and make it possible for those small businesses to give back to the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase from a small business, you help provide job opportunities. For every 10 jobs that exist at a small business, another seven are supported within the same community. Small businesses also generate two out of every three net new jobs, so shopping locally with a small business can have a big impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every dollar spent at a local small business, roughly 67 cents stays within the community. These contributions go past tax dollars, as many small businesses support local events, sports teams, and charities. The ripple effect of shopping at small businesses goes so much farther than many people realize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you shop small, you’re helping a small business owner realize the rewards of their hard work and determination. You may be giving a parent flexibility while raising their children, or you might be supporting a lifelong passion for the business owner. </span></p>
<h2>Why is Small Business Saturday So Important This Year?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While shopping with local businesses is always important, it’s even more critical now, as many small businesses are still struggling to recover from a challenging couple of years due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coronavirus pandemic quickly impacted small businesses. A report from the </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/state-of-small-business-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook &amp; Small Business Roundtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that within the first month of quarantine, approximately one-third of small businesses had temporarily stopped operating, and just one month later, more than half of small businesses were forced to lay off or furlough employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with brick-and-mortar businesses ready and eager to welcome in-person shoppers once again, a strong consumer showing this holiday season could be just the thing local small businesses need to get back on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2021/American-Express-Celebrates-the-12th-Annual-Small-Business-Saturday-Bringing-a-Digitally-Integrated-Holiday-Shopping-Experience-to-Communities-/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express Shop Small Impact survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of small businesses surveyed say this year’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is their most critical one yet. A whopping 78% say their 2021 holiday sales will impact their ability to keep their doors open in 2022. It’s estimated that consumers have the potential to contribute $695B into the U.S. small business economy by shopping small this holiday season, highlighting the tremendous impact shopping small can have on the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take place on November 27, 2021. By shopping small, both on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and on a regular basis, you can help make a difference for small business owners, their employees, and your community. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1042804828-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Close-up percentage symbol with businessman typing on calculator atop a stack of invoices." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1042804828-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1042804828.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the cost of doing business involves playing the waiting game. This can be a challenging game for companies to play if they need to get their hands on some cash fast. Giving your customers time to pay their bills can make their lives a whole lot easier and may be the only way they can afford to make purchases from you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s understandable why your customers may need to wait on their cash flow to pick up to pay their bills, your business may have the same need. Two potential solutions to cash flow problems caused by </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waiting for invoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be paid are bill discounting and invoice discounting. Let’s look at how these two processes vary, how much they cost, and the benefits and downsides of each solution. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is bill discounting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with bill discounting. Bill discounting offers a solution to unpaid invoices that are scheduled to be paid in the future. Essentially, the process of </span><a href="https://www.m1xchange.com/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entails selling unpaid invoices to a financier who will then pursue payment. When the company sells their unpaid invoices to a financier, they do so by offering them a discount. The point of doing this is to gain access to short-term financial assistance. This can be really helpful if your company is in need of working capital and wants to speed up your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at a bill discounting example. If Business A sold $100,000 worth of goods to Business B on credit, Business B will be issued an invoice they will have to pay at some point. If Business A is confident that Business B will pay their invoice but needs to access the cash from that sale sooner, they can sell that invoice to a company that provides bill discounting services. If Company A agrees to give a 15% discount to the bill discounting provider, they will be given $97,500. </span><a href="https://www.m1xchange.com/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much a company will have to pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> varies greatly depending on factors like the businesses’ financial history, the applicant’s credit score, and how stable the business is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While bill discounting will lead to earning less, which can be frustrating, if a business really needs cash to fund a business expenditure, order more inventory, or pay their employees, they may find bill discounting is worth the slight loss. These are a few of the benefits of bill discounting.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep cash flowing </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain fast access to cash in as little as 24 hours</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No collateral required</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill discounting is not a loan, and no debt is incurred</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet is not impacted as this is an off-the-book process</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is invoice discounting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up next is invoice discounting. It’s very easy to confuse bill discounting and invoice discounting since the terms sound so similar and help solve the same problem, but these are two very different processes. This is primarily because </span><a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-invoice-discounting.html#:~:text=Invoice%20discounting%20is%20the%20practice,issued%20by%20a%20finance%20company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses unpaid invoices to act as collateral for a loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans are relatively short-term because the company can pay them back as soon as the invoice is paid. After going through invoice discounting, the company will receive a loan that is smaller than the amount of the outstanding invoices (usually 80% or any invoices that are less than 90 days old). Generally, the company financing the loan gives out loans based on the total percentage of invoices owed in order to spread out their liability. That way even if all the invoices aren’t paid, the company taking out the loan can still pay back their debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to bill discounting, invoice discounting provides a solution for companies looking to speed up their cash flow while they wait for their customers to pay their invoices. The company financing the invoice discounting generally charges interest on the loan and a monthly fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice discounting is typically a better fit for companies that have high profit margins that can help them cover the interest payments associated with invoice discounting. If a business has low profit margins, they may find this type of financing makes it hard for them to earn a profit. Typically, businesses pursue invoice discounting as a last resort because facing both interest payments and fees isn’t super appealing, and many only turn to invoice discounting if they can’t secure another form of financing.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice Factoring</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we compare and contrast the differences between bill discounting and invoice discounting, let’s take a quick look at what </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is as many businesses consider this financing solution when they need to gain access to cash flow quickly. Invoice factoring and invoice discounting are two different processes, despite their very similar names. Invoice factoring is a type of invoice financing that allows companies to sell their unpaid invoices to a factoring company. The factoring company then pursues payment directly from the customers who owe the business money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though both bill discounting and factoring provide similar short-term financing solutions,  bill discounting acts as an advance of sorts against a bill owed. Invoice factoring on the other hand, involves the outright purchase of trade debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may  lose quite a bit of cash when utilizing </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/business-financing-options/invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at a rate of about 60% to 95% of the total invoice value. Invoice factoring may be a better option for companies whose clients are overdue on their invoice payments and who don’t have time to track down late payments. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between bill and invoice discounting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure whether bill discounting or invoicing is a better fit for your business? Let’s take a look at how the two options compare.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both </span><a href="https://www.herofincorp.com/blog/what-bill-or-invoice-discounting#:~:text=Difference%20between%20Bill%20%26%20Invoice%20Discounting&amp;text=While%20invoice%20discounting%20is%20meant,30%20days%20to%20120%20days" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill discounting and invoice discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serve a similar purpose for businesses. Each of these options give businesses a way to get their hands on the funds they’re waiting for after issuing invoices to their customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some key differences between these two financing options. Invoice discounting is a loan, whereas bill discounting acts as a bill of exchange. When you pursue invoice discounting, you can only do so for unpaid invoices that will be paid in 90 days, whereas bill discounting offers more flexibility and can work for bills due anywhere from 30 to 120 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what financing option a company pursues, they’ll want to make sure they shop around to see which financing companies can offer them the lowest interest rates and fees. This is an important step that can help save businesses a lot of money. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Fundbox Can Help</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both bill discounting and invoice discounting can provide solutions for business owners that need cash fast, neither of these options may be the best option for your business. If you’re looking for ongoing flexible financing options, a revolving line of credit may be a better fit for your business. A business line of credit can help businesses  cover more than just slow or late invoice payments and can step in when sales are slow or unplanned expenses arise. Having access to a business line of credit can make it easier to get through a rough patch—and can be what helps your business survive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can pay back in equal installments over the course of a 12 or 24 week plan. You won’t face any penalties for repaying early and each time you make a payment, your available credit replenishes, giving you ongoing access to funds should you need them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re hoping to attract new customers, retain existing ones, expand your resources, and increase your reach and revenue, keep reading for some helpful small business strategy options. While every strategy might not work for your business, hopefully they’ll give you an idea of how you can make your business stand out amongst the crowd. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create business and marketing plans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best strategies for small business owners hoping to achieve business growth is a simple one, create a business plan and a marketing plan. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing a business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to map out your goals so that you can stay on track to meet them. A strong business plan contains the following sections:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive summary</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company description</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descriptions of offerings and value propositions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and sales strategies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial info</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appendix (optional)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to making sure people actually know about your offerings and figuring out how to promote your business, you’ll want to consider creating a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your small business. Develop a marketing plan that outlines what your marketing goals are, what steps you intend to take to meet them, and what your budget looks like so that you know exactly how to promote your business and can cut out any guesswork. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get social with customers and clients</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While social media gets all the attention these days in the marketing world, there are plenty of ways to get social with your customers and clients that go far past tweeting. Yes, most businesses will want to have a robust social media strategy in place. Social media is a great way to update your audience about new product launches, sales and promotions, and can be a fun and easy way to engage with your clients or customers on an ongoing basis. Marketers have found that social media marketing can lead to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/188447/influence-of-global-social-media-marketing-usage-on-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased exposure, improved traffic, better lead generation, and growing fan loyalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that being said, you should also find ways to connect with your audience outside of social media. Virtual networking events, live webinars, and in-person events (once social distancing restrictions lift), are all great ways to connect with your clients and customers who are interested in learning more about your products and services. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your customer service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’re talking about getting social, </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/363182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investing in your customer service offerings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to build loyalty and keep customers happy. Create an effective customer service strategy that is responsive (you don’t want to keep them waiting for long), have solutions readily in place for common issues (like missing deliveries), and make sure that all of your customer service staff interact with your customers in a way that represents your company’s culture and values. As </span><a href="https://c1.sfdcstatic.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/research/salesforce-state-of-the-connected-customer-4th-ed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported they would forgive a company for making a mistake after receiving excellent customer service, it’s easy to see how investing in customer service can pay off big time. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide valuable content </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About </span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of marketers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that content marketing is an extremely important part of their marketing strategy. Why are marketers so crazy about content marketing? This form of marketing does exactly what it sounds like, it relies on content. Generally, this term refers to web-based content such as blog posts, e-guides, and other content you can host on your businesses’ website. Content serves multiple purposes that can help a business meet their goals, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing brand loyalty. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business, your main goal is to earn revenue. However you don’t want to always be asking your customers to make purchases. To build brand loyalty, it can be helpful to give them something for free. Creating valuable and engaging content for your audience encourages them to come to you at times other than when they need to spend money. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Increasing SEO hits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The more content you have hosted on your website, the better chance that curious searchers will end up on your website after typing their query into a search engine. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Boosting your social and email presence. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want something besides advertisements and sales pitches to put in your email newsletters and social posts? Content gives you something fun or useful to promote that can help space out your pushes for purchases. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Building your authority. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want your customer base to respect you as an expert in your field? Providing top notch resources on your subject matter via content can help you build your reputation as an authoritative player in your industry. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your revenue streams</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what they say about putting all of your eggs in one basket—don’t. When it comes to business, </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/363182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">having multiple streams of revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (such as selling various products or offering more than one service) can help you increase interest in your brand and can accommodate the natural ebb and flow of revenue your products and services may generate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you own a company that only provides swimming lessons to children, you’ll likely struggle to generate revenue during the winter. If you add first aid classes for parents into the mix, you’ll be able to focus on that area of your business during the winter and can upsell the parents of your swimming students to take first aid classes all year round. If you already have a loyal customer base, try to come up with complimentary products and services you can offer that they’ll likely be interested in. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create strategic partnerships</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a small business on your own can be challenging, sometimes to take your business to the next level you might want to collaborate on a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic business partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help lighten your load and bring more resources to the table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strategic business partnership occurs when two businesses agree to team up and share their resources in order to mutually benefit. Small businesses often benefit from these partnerships because they can team up with other businesses in their industry in order to gain access to a new target market or to get their hands on valuable resources. By pairing up with another business, you can compete better with larger businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three types of strategic partnerships:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint venture: This is when two companies combine their resources with the goal of meeting a certain objective. Both companies will be responsible for any costs and profits relating to this joint venture but they remain separate business entities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity strategic alliance: To make an equity strategic alliance happen, one of the companies in the strategic partnership has to actually purchase equity in the other company. In some cases, both companies in the partnership will purchase equity in each other’s companies.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-equity strategic alliance: Two or more companies sign a contract that states they agree to combine their resources in a non-equity strategic alliance. However, neither company will create a separate entity or share any equity.</span></li>
</ul>

A solid CRM database can help you simplify your business flow and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build stronger relationships with the customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and clients you need to help boost your sales easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM system houses all of your data, customer information, and reports in one convenient location, which enables your sales and marketing teams to better analyze their relationships with your current and potential clients and customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s examine what you need to look for when choosing a CRM and at some of the best CRMs for small business on the market. Spoiler alert—some of them are free to use.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Look for in a CRM</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing a CRM system, you’ll want to find one that suits all of your business needs and makes your employee’s jobs easier so they can focus on doing what they do best, instead of trying to organize overwhelming amounts of customer data. When shopping around for a CRM, you’ll want to read a lot of reviews, chat with their sale’s teams, and watch tutorials on how to use their platforms. When you’re doing your research, these are the qualities and features you should pay attention to.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrates with other platforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to use</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong analytic capabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can access via mobile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation options</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer service support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training requirements and resources</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How workflow is managed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflow management</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you’ll choose a CRM that you can customize to fit your needs, that is easy to use, and that works for your budget. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CRMs for Small Businesses </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of different CRM systems on the market and which one is right for your business will depend on your businesses’ unique needs. Let’s look at some of the best CRMs for small businesses and what makes them stand out.</span></p>
<h3>1. Salesforce</h3>
<p><a href="https://essentials.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the biggest names in the CRM game and is one of the most popular CRM providers on the market. They offer a cloud-based product that is completely customizable and is fairly easy to use on both desktop and mobile. Salesforce is one of the pricier options on this list, starting at $25 per month for up to five users and the price goes up if you want a more sophisticated plan, but many say the high prices are worth it. </span></p>
<h3>2. Zoho CRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cloud-based solution is </span><a href="http://www.zoho.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoho CRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses on providing resources for small and medium-sized businesses.

They also offer a free version of their CRM, which comes with more functionality and assistance like phone support. Their CRM service is easy to navigate which is great for CRM beginners. </span></p>
<h3>4. Apptivo</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This web-based CRM makes it simple to track and stay on top of projects, customer relationships, and finances. </span><a href="https://www.apptivo.com/solutions/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apptivo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is super customizable and you get to pick the features that will suit your business.

While this CRM tool can be harder to customize, they’re known for having a great tech support team who is always willing to help. </span></p>
<h3>6. Nimble</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re aiming to unify your data and improve your social media integration, </span><a href="https://www.nimble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nimble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help with that. Their software populates the profiles and interaction histories from your contact lists, email, and social media automatically. Users appreciate their comprehensive interface which gives a great overview of what’s going on in your business. You’ll be able to easily overlook your key deals, engagement opportunities, and important to-do’s. </span></p>
<h3>7. SuiteCRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business is growing, you’ll want to pick a CRM that can grow with you. </span><a href="https://suitecrm.com/what-is-suitecrm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuiteCRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is likely up to the task as it is an open source CRM that can be scaled to work well for any size of business. They have enterprise-level functionality and you can choose to deploy their software on either a private cloud, directly on private servers, or on a public cloud. Their tool is very customizable and can suit a variety of budgets as they have a free CRM option. This isn’t the easiest CRM to use and it may take some practice to get the hang of it. Typically, SuiteCRM is a better fit for companies with more advanced CRM needs. </span></p>
<h3>8. Insightly</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insightly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a free CRM service that makes it easy to track your business leads and to ensure that you’re following up with leads on time. You can also manage tasks for your team with Insightly and can link your customer’s social media accounts to your CRM so you can manage the conversion process easier.

<h3>9. Act!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.act.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a ton of neat integrations that will help you get the most out of this CRM tool.

Other integrations can assist with managing your accounting processes, creating pipeline reports, and overseeing client history. They offer a cloud-based version or a server-based version, so you can choose which format works best for you. This is ideal if you’re </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving your business online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have a preferred format. If you’re a fan of email marketing, you’ll appreciate that Act! offers built-in email marketing tools that you can integrate with your phone systems. Some users reported that their software is easy to use, but if you’re looking for a lot of integration options you may find the adjustment is worth it. Pricing starts at $15 a month and goes up to $45 a month depending on which plan you choose. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does Google have a CRM product?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a commonly asked question during CRM research and unfortunately the answer is no. However, Google does allow you to sync up your Google Workspace with plenty of helpful CRM and sales tools that you can discover through the </span><a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/category/business-tools/sales-and-crm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer Microsoft tools to Google ones anyways, you’re in luck, because Microsoft Dynamics CRM will look and feel very familiar to Microsoft Office users and it syncs up well with other Microsoft products. </span></p>

That being said, you don’t have to do everything on your own. Sometimes a little help from friends can go a long way. This is where your small business network comes in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a robust network is one of the best ways to stay up to date on business news in your industry, find the right people to hire, build brand awareness, and get expert insight on some of your biggest business development problems. There’s no need to pay for pricey business consulting sessions if you have a robust network of like-minded professionals who are ready to help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to build your ideal network is to pursue online business networking. There are plenty of online networking groups for business owners just like you. We’ve done the leg work and rounded up nine of the best online business networks for you to consider joining. Hopefully, you’ll find your perfect networking group in no time. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is online business networking?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online business networking has a lot of great advantages. Essentially, when you attend an online networking event or join a business networking group, you gain opportunities to network from your own home. While online business networking existed well before the pandemic eliminated more traditional networking opportunities, it’s really easy to see the appeal of networking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and safely from a distance now. How these events and groups are structured will vary greatly depending on the group you end up joining, but we’ll break down some examples of what these different groups look like. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. StartUp Nation </span></h2>

It’s cheesy to say, but oh so true in the world of business. When you’re running a small business, having extra cash on hand can really come in handy. Whether you want some startup funding to get the ball rolling or need a little help to cover payroll while overcoming a temporary challenge, a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you get the job done. Let’s dive into how to get a small business loan, where to find one, and what your alternatives may look like. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to get a small business loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure where to start when looking for a small business loan for the first time, there are a few different paths you can pursue. Small business loans are often available at banks and credit unions, as well as online lenders or alternative lenders. Each one of these sources may have different offerings and requirements, so let’s take a look at what you can generally expect when dealing with each.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks and credit unions </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same financial institutions you do your personal banking at may have small business loans available. Of course, you can look outside your usual bank or credit union as well. However, if you’re in good standing with your bank regarding your personal accounts, that can work in your favor when applying for a small business loan. Both banks and credit unions tend to serve larger and more established businesses, but that doesn’t mean small businesses can’t fit into those categories. Especially, if the bank or credit union has loans backed by the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA)—these are known as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Loans backed by the SBA lower the risk for the lender, so it can make it easier for newer small businesses to take out a loan. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online and alternative lenders</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, you don’t have to stick to traditional financing methods. Online lenders and alternative lenders (like peer-to-peer lenders) can offer similar products as banks or credit unions, they just do so without offering in-person access to customers. If you prefer to do your banking in person, an online lender may not be the best fit. However, a lot of online lenders offer more flexibility than brick-and-mortar banks, which can be a good fit when starting a new business. There are also peer-to-peer small business lenders that can be found online where you can connect with investors looking to support small businesses. Peer-to-peer lending typically has less stringent criteria than when working with a big bank or credit union, but because the risk level can be high for lenders, you may have higher interest rates than you would find with a traditional business loan.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of small business loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few types of small business loans that may be available to you. Each has their own unique benefits and downsides, so you’ll need to think carefully about which type is best for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business line of credit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit works similarly to a credit card and you can use it to make purchases for your business such as stocking up on inventory or paying for ads. This form of credit comes with a maximum limit you can borrow and what’s helpful is that if you don’t borrow the full amount, you won’t pay interest on any money not borrowed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business term loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum, as well as a fixed term and repayment amount. Payment will include both interest and principal payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice financing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some small businesses struggle with cash flow while waiting for invoices to be paid. If this is an area you struggle with, invoice financing (also known as factoring) can help by allowing you to sell your unpaid invoices to a lender at a discounted rate. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchant cash advance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A merchant cash advance provides borrowers with a lump sum that is based on their predicted future sales. This form of financing typically comes with high fees and may take a cut of your sales on a daily or weekly basis. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to apply for a small business loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application process for a small business loan will vary a bit by lender, but generally you can expect to need to present the following supporting documentation during the application process. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information about your personal background</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resume</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income tax returns for the past two years or more</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation regarding any past and current business loans</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimum of 12 months of your personal and business bank account statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation that supports the cost and value of any personal or business property that you may want to use to secure the loan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your plan for how you intend to use the loan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt schedule</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal documents such as: licenses, leases, articles of incorporation, and contracts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also likely that lenders may want to run a credit check during the application process. Your credit history and score can affect how easy it is for you to get a loan, as well as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms you’re offered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a good chance your personal credit score will be evaluated, especially if you’re starting a new business, but if you have a business credit score, that may come into consideration as well. There is no one set minimum credit score that you must have to get a loan, but generally the better your credit score is, the better rates and terms you’ll be offered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a low credit score, getting a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be an easier path to take, as lenders will have your collateral to help lower their risk level. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatives to small business loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a small business loan does not feel like the right fit, entrepreneurs have a few other options at their disposal. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative online financing</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=g_s_tcpa_brand_search&amp;utm_term=%2Bfundbox&amp;utm_content=34351711000&amp;campaign_source=google&amp;campaignid=629220125&amp;targetid=kwd-310864995108&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;creative=477358285425&amp;placement=&amp;matchtype=b&amp;adpos=&amp;glcid=Cj0KCQiAmfmABhCHARIsACwPRAD8WfWxd2zTP5cYf6NavAKcuKUkp-qirjyD55PA3SkvWLM-g9dKSpMaAtX3EALw_wcB&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmfmABhCHARIsACwPRAD8WfWxd2zTP5cYf6NavAKcuKUkp-qirjyD55PA3SkvWLM-g9dKSpMaAtX3EALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides approved business owners with access to the capital they need to support their business, whether that be by purchasing equipment, paying bills, or overcoming cash flow gaps. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some business credit cards offer low interest rates or a 0% introductory rate which can provide small business owners with a low or no-interest loan of sorts. Many card issuers offer six months without interest. A business credit card is only a good financing option if you’re able to pay off your purchases before the introductory rate ends and a higher interest rate kicks in. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP Loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, there are some unique options available to small businesses looking for financing help in light of the coronavirus pandemic. One such option is a PPP Loan. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a loan provided by the SBA to help small business owners and non-profit enterprises keep their workers employed during this difficult time. Currently, you can apply for PPP Loan until May 31, 2021.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1085354030-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="marketing team meeting with business woman standing facing colleagues as she writes on a large white pad on an easel by a large office window." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1085354030-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1085354030.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfect world, your business would thrive on word of mouth marketing alone. Over time, your business may be able to benefit greatly from the simple act of customers loving your products or services and spreading the word. For that to happen though, you need to make sure people learn about all of your amazing offerings. This is where a marketing strategy comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good marketing strategy can help a small business build brand awareness and accomplish their goals. So let’s take a look at how you can create a small business marketing strategy that works for your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Do a competitive analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tried and true business strategy that can help you create a solid marketing strategy is to do a competitive analysis. A competitive analysis involves identifying your main competitors and researching their products, branding, and marketing strategies. The point of studying your competitors closely is not to copy them, but to see what is working for them and to consider if a similar strategy may or may not work for your brand. For example, if you’re focused on B2B marketing, social media may seem like a waste of time. But if you see that a competitor has found a savvy way to use LinkedIn to their advantage, you may start to see the social appeal. Ideally, you’ll leverage what you learn about your competitors’ marketing strategies and make yours even better. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Analyze your customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are your customers? Where do they live? How old are they? How much do they earn? Take whatever data you have about your customers and put it to work. Take note of who your current customer base is and what your ideal customer base looks like. If these two align, then great! You know exactly who you’re marketing to and can plan your strategy around what makes them tick. But if you’re trying to shift to a new customer base, you’ll need to create a strategy that can keep your current base happy and begin to attract a new one at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One great way to learn more about your customers is to create a customer survey and ask for their feedback. Straightforward, simple, and very revealing. Offering customers a coupon or some other sort of incentive for taking the survey is always a good idea. Asking for their honest feedback about what they love and—just as importantly—don’t love about your business can give you major insight into how to improve your business. You can also ask for details about how they like to interact with your business. Are they fans of email updates about new products? Do they prefer to shop online or in-person? Do they like to call to make an appointment or would they be more likely to use an online booking service? Find out what really makes them tick and plan around that. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Watch out for trends</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can be scary to jump off the deep end into a new <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/2021-small-business-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketing trend</a>, being a trendsetter has its perks. Mainly, less competition. In 2020, a major digital marketing trend was to utilize TikTok. Plastic surgeons debunk cosmetic surgery myths in fun quick videos on TikTok. Dance studios show off their students’ talent. People are having fun while marketing their businesses at the same time. Pay attention to the cultural zeitgeist and see what trends you can use to your advantage. In 2021, it’s likely a new craze may come along and create room for marketers to make waves. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Create a marketing plan and then change it</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’re fine tuning what type of marketing strategy works for your small business, put your plans in writing. Create a marketing plan that outlines everything you learned in the analysis of your competitors and customers. Then include your marketing plans for the entire year if possible. Break these plans down by quarter and include the benchmarks you hope to meet. Allocate a budget for any marketing expenses and make this plan as thorough as possible. Marketers that document their marketing strategies are </span><a href="https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/CoSchedule_State-Of-Marketing-2019_Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">313% more likely to report success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than those who don’t document their plan!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s where things get exciting. Feel free to change this plan from time to time. The point of documenting your marketing plan is not to force yourself to follow it exactly, but to give you focus and direction. If you realize after six months that content marketing just doesn’t work for your business, you may want to allocate those resources to a different marketing strategy, like paid social ads. It’s okay to alter your marketing plan, as long as you’re thoughtful about it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Pick a strategy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no one right small business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re going to look at a few popular strategies, but take them all with a grain of salt. Some may be the perfect fit for your business and others may be a huge mistake. Feel free to combine multiple strategies, there is no need to pick just one! Remember, if you try a marketing strategy that doesn’t work for your small business, you can alway pivot. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go digital</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world that is becoming more and more digital by the minute. In many ways, technology makes our lives easier. Digital marketers know this best. If you need to refresh your small business marketing, consider going digital. There are countless tools and avenues available to you to promote your business in a digital way. You can reach a very wide audience or a super tailored one with the help of data and analytics. You can market your small business digitally for free on Facebook or you can use a budget to fund large digital ad campaigns. The point is, you have choices. Sponsor a podcast. Take out a ton of Google Ads. Create a weekly email newsletter. The digital sky&#8217;s the limit!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get social</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While getting social on social media is a great place to start (</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of people are active on social media after all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), your social media marketing efforts can extend far past the occasional Tweet. If you are using social media marketing, make sure you’re actually socializing with your customers. Respond to their comments and direct messages. Share their user generated content. Make them feel like your business has a living breathing presence and is listening to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget, you can get social in ways that don’t involve being glued to your smartphone. Attend virtual networking events or sponsor the high school baseball team. Create opportunities to truly connect with your clients and customers and you can develop some brand loyalty along the way.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be influential</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason influencers are all the rage, they’re very influential. A </span><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/influencer-marketing-2019-benchmark-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that businesses are making $5.20 for every $1 they spend on influencer marketing. Find an influencer whose audience aligns with your customer base and hire them to create marketing assets for you. You’ll gain unique and valuable promotions for your products or services and access to their audience at the same time. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it local</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of digital marketing is that it can help you connect with new customers or clients from around the world. That being said, global domination isn’t for everyone. If you want your small business to focus on serving your community, then consider creating a marketing strategy that really caters to them. If you run a single restaurant or a dry cleaning business, then coupons in your local paper may bring you much more business than being active on five different social media platforms.</span></p>

Late nights? No problem. Balancing multiple roles? On it. Working with an almost nonexistent budget? Sounds familiar. Small business owners who want to stretch their budget as far as it can go will appreciate learning about free small business resources. Here are links to some popular business, community, and educational resources that won’t cost you a penny. </span></p>
<h2>Lean on National Small Business Resources</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For expert business advice, you can always trust the </span><a href="https://www.amcanchamber.org/2017/12/22/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Small Business Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SBA). Founded in 1953, the SBA provides free small business resources designed to help entrepreneurs pursue their business goals. This is the only cabinet-level federal agency that is entirely dedicated to providing resources for small businesses. Not only do they provide advice and insight on tricky business topics, but you can pursue counseling and capital opportunities through the SBA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.amcanchamber.org/2017/12/22/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Federation of Independent Businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NFIB) is a nonprofit group that has great resources for small business owners. NFIB has legal resources and advocates on behalf of small and independent business owners in the U.S. that make a major impact for business owners as a whole nationwide. You won’t want to miss their free webinars that break down complex topics like PPP Loan Forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also look for industry specific nationwide resources that touch on your businesses’ more niche needs. </span></p>
<h2>Look Into Community Resources</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While nationwide business resources are great and often really well produced, pursuing business resources closer to home has its perks. Your local </span><a href="https://www.amcanchamber.org/2017/12/22/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chamber of Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely provides amazing business resources and they’re a great place to turn when you have location specific questions about things like ordinances and permits. Most communities have a Chamber of Commerce whose goal it is to help local businesses thrive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may find that they host networking events with other business owners or plan community events designed to help spread awareness about small businesses in the area. They typically provide free marketing resources to make sure the community can learn more about your business. Not to mention, being a member of your local Chamber of Commerce can lend credibility to your business. Your Chamber of Commerce also likely lobbies local representatives when it comes to fighting for the interests of area business owners, so it can be very beneficial in the longterm to get involved and learn more about what they’re working on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may also be local clubs or Facebook groups created by other entrepreneurs designed to help form connections between business owners that you can participate in. Join a few of these groups and get to know your fellow local entrepreneurs. You never know who may be able to connect you to your next big client or who may help you find the perfect supplier.</span></p>
<h2>Take Free Online Courses</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start your own business, there is a pretty steep learning curve. One day you’ll get the hang of things, but all savvy entrepreneurs know to always keep learning. Enter: free online courses. E-learning is all the rage these days thanks to how convenient and accessible it is from anywhere in the world. Platforms like </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera</span></a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Udacity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edX</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all offer free business classes (note that not all classes on each platform are free) on topics ranging from strategy, to digital marketing, to bookkeeping. It’s time to flex your mental muscles for free! If there is a business area you’re lacking in, don’t shy away from hitting the virtual books, you’ll feel more empowered and have the knowledge you need to make strategic decisions. </span></p>
<h2>Have an Online Presence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting digital doesn’t have to cost a dime. Having a social media presence is free, unless you choose to invest money into advertisements on those platforms. You can also advertise your business on digital resources like </span><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google My Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yelp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> free of charge. These platforms allow you to share key details about your business such as hours of operation and contact info, as well as provide opportunities for your happy customers to leave glowing reviews. Think of customer reviews as word of mouth advertisements on a much larger scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some social media channels even provide free resources designed to help businesses succeed on their platform and to grow their business in general. For example, you can find Facebook business resources through </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/resource" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FACEBOOK for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This platform offers free resources to help find success on Facebook and Instagram, but also provides more general and topical resources relating to business issues such as COVID-19 relief programs and grant opportunities. </span></p>
<h2>Fundbox Small Business Resources</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of your go-to business service providers may offer free resources designed to help your small business get a leg up. At Fundbox, we love going the extra mile and providing our customers with extra resources to help them understand complex topics like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collections_shutterstock_1719832198-768x512.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Debt collection net terms" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collections_shutterstock_1719832198-768x512.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Collections_shutterstock_1719832198.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment you’ve always dreaded is here. A customer whom you’ve offered the courtesy of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/welcome-new-net-terms-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade credit in the form of net terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like net 30 days) is late on their payments. They’re so late in fact, that it’s time to start considering your debt collection options. This can be the worst case scenario for both the business owner and the customer and is something both parties likely want to avoid. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dilemma can be especially troublesome for small businesses like manufacturers who depend on preserving their valuable relationships with their customers, such as sellers. Sometimes such partnerships go back many years, were difficult to obtain, and may even bear the additional weight of personal friendships. These emotional factors make the prospect of debt collection even more stressful and risky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel you have no choice but to pursue debt collections, then you should arm yourself with the proper knowledge about the collections process. Debt collection is something to take very seriously. A misstep during this highly-regulated process can lead to your company incurring fees or legal penalties. Before you launch into this process, consider improving your collective knowledge about collections. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know the Laws</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, you should keep to the letter of the law during the debt collection process. Enter: the</span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/debt-collection-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FDCPA). Most famously, this act protects consumers from harassment from debt collectors. However, it does not technically apply its protections to business debt. Credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgage, medical bills, and other household debts receive protection from this act. Many businesses also choose to follow the general principles of the FDCPA if their customers fall into the small business or sole proprietor categories.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDCPA may not cover collection from the</span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/debt-collection-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> original creditor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who a consumer owes debt to. That being said, there are certain best practices associated with the FDCPA that may be worth following. Doing so can help maintain your business reputation and some goodwill with the debtor, such as not harassing the debtor day and night regarding the debt. It’s also worth reviewing your specific state’s regulations regarding debt collections to ensure you’re not breaking any laws. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beware of the Legal Risks of Collections</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to pursue collections, you can choose to outsource this task to a debt collection agency, which will cost you additional money. The FDCPA identifies collection agencies, debt buyers, and lawyers who specialize in debt collection as debt collectors. Another option would be to sell the debt, at a partial loss, to a company that purchases past-due debts and then works to collect them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business to business debt is generally known as commercial debt. While the FDCPA does not provide protections for commercial debt, the Commercial Collection Agency Association (CCAA) has regulations that commercial debt collection agents must abide by. To lower your risk of a debtor pursuing legal action, you may want to work with a debt collection agent who is a certified member of CCAA. Members have to abide by certain ethical standards which can provide peace of mind.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid Offering Terms to High Risk Customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to protect your business from facing collection processes in the future is to be more conservative or smarter when offering net terms to customers, especially new ones. Understand that providing net terms essentially turns your Accounts Receivable department into a finance company. A first step of financing is to determine the creditworthiness of your customer. Doing so can involve processing credit applications, running credit checks, or acquiring financial information and references to perform due diligence. After approving an application, your team will need to negotiate and write a credit policy. All the while, you’ll be managing customer expectations and relationships.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider This Before Turning Outside</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find yourself in a position where your business needs to pursue debt collections, the costly option of hiring an outside collections agency or contractor may seem worthwhile. This may be especially true if your employees struggle to get the job done, waste valuable time and energy, and expose you to costly legal mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the costs involved, turning your past due accounts over to a third-party collections agency may perhaps affect the relationship you had established with some sensitive clients, due to the cold, practical nature of a collections representative compared to you, their known business partner. You may want to think twice before giving up the personal touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to resorting to collections, some businesses consider </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/factoring-right-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get paid for outstanding invoices immediately. With factoring, a third-party company will purchase your outstanding invoices for a percentage of their value (typically between 10 to 20 percent, or possibly more if the invoices are past due, plus any extra fees and charges). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, factoring has some serious downsides. You never get the full value of your invoices, your clients may be confused when contacted by a new company, and that may even cast into doubt the stability of your own business. </span></p>
<p>To help minimize the impact to your cash flow while waiting for customers to pay their invoices, consider turning to a <strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox line of credit</a></strong>, which can allow you to draw short-term liquid cash based on the anticipated revenue from outstanding invoices.</p>
