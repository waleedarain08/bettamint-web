Typical payment terms were 30 days and, with potential check clearance times, you were looking at up to 60 days between invoicing and payment.</p>
<p>And that’s assuming things went smoothly. If there was a mistake on the invoice or accounts payable lost track of it or the check got lost in the mail, the business owner would need to spend precious time and energy looking into delays, resolving them and, once again, waiting for the check to arrive in the mail.</p>
<p>We don’t live in those days anymore.</p>
<p>The world is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/faster-payments-clients">faster, more efficient place</a></span>. Technology has made simple transactions easier than ever. And that extends to your business’s accounting function. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/cloud-accounting-get-paid-faster">Cloud applications have become game changers</a></span> when it comes to getting paid faster, improving cash flow, having a good sense of where your business stands at all times, reducing paperwork and providing a better experience for your customers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, here’s how cloud accounting can get you paid dramatically faster.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accept Online Payments</span></h2>
<p>How do you pay your personal bills and business suppliers? Probably not by check, right? So why are you still accepting that form of payment for the work you do? Credit, debit, Apple Pay, Google Pay, WePay, e-transfer and PayPal are just some of the common ways businesses get paid faster. In fact, according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/">FreshBooks</a></span> research, you’ll get paid twice as fast when you accept online payments!</p>
<p>And let’s face it: clients expect to be able to pay easily with credit cards or using payment gateways. After all, they have choices everywhere else they do financial transactions. It’s good for your image to offer convenience instead of throwing them back to checkbook days.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automate Payments</span></h2>
<p>Do you have clients on retainer – or do you bill some customers the same amount every month? (Congratulations!) You can save yourself some time by setting up automatic payments in your billing software and the system will take care of it without you having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>Want to improve your cash flow? Consider switching monthly billing to bi-weekly. And shorten those payment terms to 15 days.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Payment Reminders and Late Fees</span></h2>
<p>Every business runs into truant clients from time to time. The invoice got lost in their inbox or on their desk. They don’t have a record of receiving it. They simply forgot about it. Whatever the excuse, you’re not getting paid when you should be.</p>
<p>Make your life easier and cut down on an awkward follow-up conversation by setting up late payment reminders in your cloud accounting software. Pre-select how often you want a late-paying client to be reminded, fill in the template and, voila! They’ll automatically get an email while you’re getting on with running your business. And if you’ve got chronically late payers, you can motivate them to pay on time by building late fees directly into your invoice.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice On-the-Go</span></h2>
<p>Do you set aside time once a month to handle your invoicing and other accounting tasks? If you’re like most small business owners, that time can easily be swallowed up by more pressing project work. When you’re on the cloud, you can take care of accounting chores in small bursts, from anywhere.</p>
<p>Most <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/easy-accounting-anywhere">cloud solutions also offer a mobile app</a></span> that allows you to do your bookkeeping on your phone or tablet. You can whip up an invoice in minutes as soon as you’ve finished the job – from the bus, the parking lot or the pub or coffee shop where you’re rewarding yourself for work well done!</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Broaden Your Clients</span></h2>
<p>Many small business owners stick to doing business with people in their communities, or at least their own countries. Even if the type of work you do can be done remotely for anyone, who wants to deal with unfamiliar sales tax and currency?</p>
<p>When you use cloud accounting, all of the headaches associated with out-of-country clients is managed for you. Simply invoice like you normally would, enter the currency and all the right information will be automatically formatted for you.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion </span></h2>
<p>There’s a certain comfort in using the same old accounting software (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/word-excel">or Word/Excel</a></span>) that you’re used to. But the advantages of using more advanced cloud technology are clear. Along with simple business practice changes, like decreasing your payment terms from 30 days to 15 days and invoicing more regularly, you’ll see a drastic improvement in your business’s cash flow. Plus, you can hand off some of the more boring and time-consuming administrative tasks to your trusty accounting system. And your records will always be up to date, so tax time will be a cinch.</p>
<p>Welcome to the present – and the future!</p>

Firing off an invoice the second a project wraps up may seem desperate and unprofessional. Waiting politely for weeks could interrupt your cash flow.</p>
<p>So when is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/timing-invoices">the best time to invoice</a></span>? Like most important decisions, the answer is: That depends on the client and the type of work you do.</p>
<p>Here are a few common scenarios:</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice upon purchase</span></h2>
<p>If you provide goods like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/indosole-uses-fundbox-save-environment-one-shoe-time/">handmade shoes</a></span> or services like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-ozglo-uses-fundbox-to-manage-cash-flow-crunches/">cleaning</a></span>, you’re not likely to send your customer an invoice by email or post—you’ll expect payment on the spot. And they’ll be prepared to pay you in cash, by check, debit or credit card.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice upon project completion</span></h2>
<p>If you’re providing tech services or are a consultant or writer, you’re probably working with B2B clients on projects that may take anywhere from a few hours to a few months. While it may be tempting to invoice the second you submit your work, it’s best to wait at least a few days. There may be questions, feedback or revisions to make. Let the project come to a natural conclusion before sending an invoice.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice at pre-determined milestones</span></h2>
<p>When you’re working on a large-scale, long-term project, it’s smart to negotiate payments at pre-determined milestones. This will allow you to purchase any necessary materials and ensure you have adequate cash flow while a portion of your time is tied up with one project. The key is to clearly define the project stage or date for each invoice.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice weekly, bi-weekly or monthly</span></h2>
<p>Do you have clients who call on you for hourly project work off and on all the time? Ideally, they’re paying you a retainer—a pre-defined amount of money every month to reserve your time. If not, preserve your cash flow and invoice regularly. Weekly is best, bi-weekly is okay and monthly is a last resort and usually reserved for larger companies who don’t want to process multiple payments every month.</p>
<p>Timing may be important when it comes to invoicing, but it’s not everything. Your payment terms go a long way to getting paid as quickly as possible. The number of days your clients have to pay after you submit your invoice will vary depending on your business and the type of customer. Common payment terms include:</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-payments and deposits</span></h2>
<p>If your customers are B2C, start-ups or businesses that have a history of late payments, there’s nothing wrong with requesting payment up front, or at least a deposit before you begin work.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">7 to 10 days</span></h2>
<p>Just a few years ago it was unheard of to request a payment in under 30 days. But credit cards, PayPal, WePay and other e-forms of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/faster-payments-clients">payment</a></span> have made settling up easier than ever. You’re probably not going to get the big company with a robust payroll department on board with one-week payment terms, but there’s no reason not to try with smaller businesses.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">30 days</span></h2>
<p>By far the most common payment terms for small businesses, a month seems reasonable for payer and payee. It gives commercial customers time to get their paperwork sorted out and shouldn’t impede your cash flow too much.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">40-60 days</span></h2>
<p>It’s not recommended to have payment terms of more than 30 days – but sometimes it’s unavoidable when working with companies with rigid accounts payable policies. The silver lining is that these organizations usually pay on the higher scale. If they don’t, reconsider working with them.</p>
<p>Although how quickly a client pays up may be somewhat out of your control, there are a lot of little things you can do to encourage quicker payment, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">accounting software</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to create and track invoices. </span>A professional-looking invoice that features your logo, the units of hours/good, hourly or flat rate and payment terms is critical for all small businesses. A good system will help you churn out invoices faster and keep track of them for you, so you always know exactly how many days till a payment is due.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discuss </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/invoice-payment-terms">payment terms</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> before you start. </span>Your clients should know exactly what they owe (or at least a very close estimate) before they open your invoice – including when it’s due.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offer online payment. </span>It’s more convenient for your customers and helps you get paid faster. Most accounting software allows you to accept credit cards, PayPal, e-transfer and other online methods of payment.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automate</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> late payment reminders. </span>Another good reason to use formal accounting software – it’ll do your “dirty” work for you, including following up with tardy clients. Simply set your payment terms, write a template and get down to other business. It’ll know when to blast an email reminder.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Charge </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">late fees</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>Sometimes the best way to motivate clients who are slow to pay is to levy a surcharge for late payments. A simple 1-2% usually does the trick. Be sure to build it into your invoice with clear payment terms, including the date when late fees will be applied.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoice regularly. </span>You can’t blame clients for cash flow problems if you’re the one who’s late to invoice. Yes, invoicing is kind of a hassle, but it’s important to stay on it. The sooner you do it, the faster you get paid.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Be polite. </span>According to FreshBooks research, being polite matters. A lot. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/invoice-payment-terms">A simple “please pay your invoice within” or “thank you for your business” can increase the percentage of invoices that are paid by more than 5 per cent</a></span>. Incorporate the magic words into your invoice and make more money.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to knowing when to invoice and what kind of payment terms to demand, there are no right or wrong answers. Know your clients, trust your instincts and be prepared to negotiate and be flexible in different situations.</p>

Delegation can feel like a luxury you can’t afford.</p>
<p>As your grow, though, your mind may change, as you recognize that if you micromanage every last detail, you won’t have the energy to make executive decisions. Taking your business to the next level means focusing on the bigger picture, not the day to day tasks.</p>
<p>The path to clearing your plate for bigger and better goals is often as simple as automating the small chores. Recently, we looked at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-ways-to-use-automation-to-ease-the-pain-of-invoicing-payment-admin-tasks/">4 ways to use automation</a></span> to ease the pain of repetitive administrative business tasks. Today, we’ll focus specifically on your accounting. How long do you spend each month sending invoices, managing payments or entering and filing expenses?</p>
<p>What if many of those time-consuming tasks could <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/9-tasks-automation-software">automatically take care of themselves</a></span>? And what if the same accounting solution could provide you with important insights that could help shape your long-term vision? Imagine the possibilities.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">5 Accounting Tasks to Automate</span></h2>
<p>Cloud-based accounting software solutions have become wildly popular with business owners. In addition to empowering entrepreneurs to quickly, securely and simply create professional-grade documents like invoices and estimates, the leading accounting software now offers a number of automated features designed to liberate you to grow your business.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Payments Collection</span></h3>
<p>Research from FreshBooks indicates that you’ll get paid twice as fast when you offer the option of paying by credit card – straight from a link in your invoice. And who doesn’t want money in their pocket sooner?</p>
<p>All you have to do is send the invoice. Plus, the payment is automatically recorded and any transaction fees are imported into your expense folder so you don’t have to do any bookkeeping.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Recurring Invoices</span></h3>
<p>Do you have regular clients that you bill the same amount every month? Look for a solution that allows you to create recurring invoices that are automatically sent for you. You can even set up an auto-billing function that automatically (and securely) charges your clients’ credit card in seconds.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Late Payment Reminders and Fees</span></h3>
<p>Following up with late-paying clients is a painful task most small business owners hate. Want to be rid of it forever?</p>
<p>If you work with the right accounting software, you may be able to automate this task off your to-do list. For example, FreshBooks allows you to set up automatic payment reminders and even <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/late-payment-fees">late payment fees</a></span> so you can outsource those <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/money-talk">awkward emails</a></span>. The software will automatically send the right reminder email at the right time. You can even customize the email for a personal touch.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Expense Import and Categorization</span></h3>
<p>Ditch the paper files and embrace a digital solution that’ll save you hours every quarter.</p>
<p>Software solutions have come a long way. Now you can use software that allows you to link your bank account or credit card and automatically upload and track expenses, eliminating time-consuming manual entry. No more scrambling during tax time, since your expenses are uploaded all year and ready to file.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Easier Estimates and Proposals</span></h3>
<p>Every small business owner knows the most time-consuming part of preparing an estimate or proposal is formatting, sending and managing it.</p>
<p>This process can become a lot more automated with a professional template. All you need to do is input the details and the cost. Once you’re finished, just hit send.</p>

(If you use a Microsoft Word invoice template, a spreadsheet or other ad hoc situation, the answer is YES!)</p>
<p>You deserve an accounting solution that makes running your business simple and secure. More and more, entrepreneurs are turning to cloud-based solutions that are more flexible, mobile and tailored to small businesses.</p>
<h3>What to Look for in a Cloud-Based Accounting Solution</h3>
<p>Cloud-based accounting software solutions offer many advantages for business owners. However, not all cloud accounting platforms are created equal. Look for a solution that has the features and support you need.</p>
<p>Here are the most important things you should watch for when making your choice.</p>
<h3>1. Security</h3>
<p>When you’re dealing with sensitive and private business information, security is a top concern. Good accounting software providers include information about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/cloud-security">security safeguards</a></span> directly on their websites, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SSL encryption.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>You should see a lock icon in your browser whenever you’re logged into your account so you know your data is secure. And all private information, including credit card numbers and bank account information should be encrypted using an advanced encryption standard (AES).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firewalls.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>The accounting application—and your data—should be securely behind a firewall provided by a reputable company.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vulnerability scanning.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>The accounting software company’s servers should be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities by a third-party security provider to test for intrusions from the Internet as well as inside the network.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data center security.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>The company’s data servers should be housed in state-of-the-art facilities that provide constant surveillance, redundant power feeds and generators, powerful fire suppression and monitored climate control. Back-up servers and data centers should be in different locations in case the primary data center is compromised by natural disaster.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regular backups.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>The ideal cloud solution should back up your data every day in a secure offsite location. This ensures that you can quickly restore your data and in case of an emergency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Features You’ll Use</h3>
<p>Traditional business accounting software is designed for mid to large-sized businesses and has complex features small businesses don’t need. Consider what you need now – and in the future. Here are some of the features that most small businesses require:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invoicing.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>You should be able to easily create a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-the-perfect-invoice/">professional-grade invoice</a></span> that you can print or send directly to your clients by email straight from the software. Invoices should feature your logo and contact information and be stored in one place so you can see exactly who owes what and when.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>Look for an accounting solution that allows your clients to pay you online. It should also automatically record when payments are made, send late payment reminders and offer an autobilling function for recurring invoices.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expense</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> tracking</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>High on your list should be a function that allows you to digitally store your expenses and then automatically categorizes them so you can see your profit vs. loss any time you log in.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Estimates</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Proposals.<br />
</span>You should be able to put together an estimate in just a few clicks. It should be stored so that it can be easily transformed into an invoice once the project is complete.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">racking.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
</span>Accounting solutions with time-tracking solutions built right in allow you to know at-a-glance exactly how long tasks really take. If you have a small team or sub-contract to other professionals, you’ll want software that allows others to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-marketing-agency-employees-track-time/">track their time</a></span>, so you have a handle on everyone’s productivity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Excellent User Experience</h3>
<p>Most cloud-based accounting solutions are built intuitively enough for everyone to use, but each will have its own unique user experience. The key is to find one that feels best to you.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review descriptions of the software’s features and watch introductory videos and product.</li>
<li>Take advantage of free trials to play around with the features you’re most interested in.</li>
<li>Check with other professionals in your industry to see what they use and how they like it. Search the Internet for reviews and product comparisons from publications you can trust.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Customer Support</h3>
<p>You must have access to good customer support when you need it. Be sure that you can reach a live person during business hours. And avoid companies that don’t list phone numbers on their website. Good luck tracking down a real person to help you if you can’t even call them!</p>
<p>Check out the FAQ section on the company’s website to see how much information you can find if you need to self-serve after hours. And pay close attention to what reviewers (both customers and tech editors) say about a product’s customer service.</p>
<h3>5. Integration With Other Apps</h3>
<p>Check to make sure the accounting software works well with your favorite apps—and think ahead to technology you may want to use in the future. For example, Fundbox partner FreshBooks also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/integrations">integrates</a></span> with G Suite (so users can invoice <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/integrations/pages/g-suite">Google</a></span> Contacts and preview client emails right in the application), Stripe (so clients can pay small business owners in FreshBooks <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/integrations/pages/stripe">using their credit cards</a></span> without being redirected to another site) and other popular tools.</p>
<p>When evaluating an accounting software option, ask: does it look like the software company is committed to continually adding integrations to make business owners’ lives easier? That’s a good sign it’ll be around for awhile.</p>
<h3>6. The Right Price</h3>
<p>Many cloud-accounting platforms are offered on a subscription basis, making it more affordable than traditional software. Look for a solution that offers plans that you can upgrade as your business grows so you’re only paying for what you use.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>When it comes to accounting, you want to feel like you’re in control. Cloud accounting solutions allow you to manage all your bookkeeping anywhere and anytime, while giving you a bird’s eye view of your small business’s overall performance.</p>
