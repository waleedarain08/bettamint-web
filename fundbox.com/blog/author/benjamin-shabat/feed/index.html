										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="432" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_1148443280-768x432.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Sunset reflecting on a row of solar panels" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_1148443280-768x432.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_1148443280.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>With so much discussion in the news about environmental awareness, many small business owners are taking a look at how to operate in a more eco-friendly fashion. Going green can save your business money, help streamline operations, and show customers that you’re responsible and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>While a water filter and a recycling bin in the office dining area are helpful, there are other steps that small business owners can take in order to have an even greater impact on the reduction of their carbon footprints. More specifically, recent technological innovations have made it easier than ever for businesses to be more earth-conscious without harming operability.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make your business more environmentally sustainable. Consider these five tips to take active steps toward conserving our planet for future generations.</p>
<h2>1. Use renewable energy</h2>
<p>Flicking a light switch or pressing the power button on a computer may not seem like it’s adding to pollution since those technologies don’t appear to run on fossil fuels. However,  they do have an impact on the environment even if they’re not emitting exhaust fumes.</p>
<p>What can you do about this? Two words: solar panels.</p>
<p>You may have heard that solar panel technology is expensive to install and doesn’t pay itself off in value for many years, but that’s not entirely accurate; installing solar panels is quickly becoming <a href="https://news.energysage.com/how-much-does-the-average-solar-panel-installation-cost-in-the-u-s/">more affordable</a>. The time that it takes to break even is largely dependent on where your business is located.</p>
<p>With the proper maintenance, a solar panel system can be one of the best ways for small businesses to minimize ecological impact while also cutting down on operational costs. According to <a href="https://news.energysage.com/commercial-solar-benefits-for-business/">some marketplace data</a>, business owners may be able to save as much as 80 percent (or even more) on their electric bills by installing solar panels.</p>
<p>Top tip: Don’t let your budget stop you from considering more environmentally sustainable business practices. For smaller businesses, in particular, the price of using eco-friendly technologies like solar panels may seem expensive at first, but may end up helping save you money on energy costs in the long run. Review your costs and figure out your “break even” point. If installing a new energy-saving feature costs a certain amount up front, but your monthly bills go down as a result, how long will it take to pay for itself? Depending on the investment, it may even make sense to finance the initial cost, using a business loan or line of credit.</p>
<h2>2. Go paper-free to reduce waste</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, eco-conscious small business owners are already doing their absolute best to reduce paper use. By now, using email to communicate with employees, clients, and customers is standard protocol.</p>
<p>But that’s just the beginning. There are many ways to apply the paperless principle to every aspect of your enterprise. Conducting communications and paying bills exclusively through digital channels will not only help save trees but will also cut expenses. The associated <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1393497">costs of using paper</a> are estimated at 31 times the purchasing cost, which is $40 on average. That means for every case of copy paper you avoid, you could save around $1,200.</p>
<p>These days, it’s getting easy to avoid using paper. You can keep everyone in your business’s network in the loop with regularly-scheduled email newsletters, updates on your company’s website, and social media posts (just to name a few).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are many online services that you can use to streamline internal operations while doing away with paper at work. For example, <a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a> and <a href="http://asana.com">Asana</a> are services that allow businesses to schedule assignments, organize projects, and share links, documents, and media with team members. Digital project management tools like this can help eliminate lots of paper from your office while increasing employee productivity.</p>
<h2>3. Work remotely to reduce emissions</h2>
<p>When you hear the term ‘CO2 emissions’, what’s the first image that comes to mind? Your answer might be a strip of highway packed with clouds of fumes billowing out of vehicle tailpipes. While cars are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, there are ways that small businesses can reduce air pollution. One way is to let employees work from home. Even one or two days that an employee doesn’t need to drive to work can make a difference.</p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible innovations made over recent years in digital communication technology (such as video chat) it’s now possible for people to telecommute to work with ease. Besides the ability to have face-to-face meetings with employees as well as clients without being in the same room, online applications such as <a href="https://www.zoom.us/">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/">Google Suite</a> allow for remote team collaboration in realtime. With all of the different innovations in high-tech, small businesses are now able to conduct business-as-usual without requiring employees to be physically present.</p>
<h2>4. Track energy consumption with the IoT</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, is one of the more exciting ways that small businesses can use technology to go green. Essentially, “IoT” refers to a network of machines outfitted with sensors that send information to a central database. That data is then analyzed and translated into information that people can use to determine how well the machine works, if it will need maintenance soon, if it meets legal parameters, and so on.</p>
<p>With that concept in mind, you can imagine the numerous ways in which the IoT could help small businesses get into a green routine. For example, some restaurants are now using sensors like <a href="https://www.monnit.com/oem-solutions/commercial-refrigeration-monitoring-sensors">Monnit</a> (among other <a href="https://www.become.co/blog/new-restaurant-technology-trends-2019/" rel="”nofollow”">tech tools</a>) to make sure refrigerator systems are maintaining the proper temperature, which aims to reduce wasted food and save money.</p>
<p>Some manufacturing companies are also using IoT sensors to monitor heavy <a href="https://www.augury.com/products/continuous-diagnostics/">machinery performance</a>, which helps predict malfunctions and avoid the costs associated with big repairs.</p>
<p>These are just two examples of how IoT is changing how businesses operate. There are many more possible applications of IoT technology for business optimization. These new technologies are providing business owners with insights into equipment performance that they didn’t have a few short years ago, which are opening up possibilities for small businesses to incorporate sustainable practices in creative ways.</p>
<h2>5. Consider doing away with your storefront</h2>
<p>Giving customers the capability to purchase products or services online is a big way to potentially reduce your impact on the environment. Selling online has a fairly straightforward effect on becoming more eco-conscious and saving money: if a business no longer has a physical office space, it would eliminate 100 percent of the cost and environmental impact of using electricity, water, and gas at that establishment.</p>
<p>Even for a business that doesn’t completely go digital, reducing the number of people who have to drive to-and-from a storefront to get their hands on a service can help limit the carbon footprint made by that business. Going green doesn’t necessarily mean tearing up an entire business plan and starting from square one. A small business can make a contribution toward protecting the planet without undergoing a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>Being conscious of our effect on the environment doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot. In fact, the opposite can be true: practicing environmental awareness can result in savings for you, as well as benefits for future generations.</p>

There’s also plenty of talk about the damage that can come as a side effect of the innovations which are designed to help society.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the discussion has focused on the potential demise of the retail industry (and there are valid reasons why). Trends in retail have been raising some pressing questions among observers. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the retail industry stand?</li>
<li>Where is the retail industry headed?</li>
<li>What can small businesses do to stay in the race with the likes of Amazon?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll touch on all this just below, and clear up a bit of the confusion while we’re at it.</p>
<h2>Retail Today</h2>
<p>Though the total number of retail stores closing in 2019 is estimated at over <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-closing-this-year-2019-2">4,000</a></span>, there are still companies that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fool.com/slideshow/15-retailers-are-opening-stores/">opening new branches</a></span>. Target, Costco, Whole Foods, and even Apple are still in the process of growing their number of physical locations. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a real concern in the physical retail market &#8211; there is.</p>
<p>When numbers come out that show retail trade sales have risen by more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf">2%</a></span> over the past year, it sounds like good news. In fact, the market value of retailing in the U.S. has risen by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.6%</span> over the past three years, and is projected to continue its upward trajectory through 2020. Appears promising, right?</p>
<p>Not exactly. So what’s the catch?</p>
<p>At the outset of 2019, retailers closed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://coresight.com/research/us-store-closures-2019-outlook-no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/">23%</a></span> more brick-and-mortar locations than they had at the beginning of 2018. Among the companies that plan on shutting down stores in 2019 are Sears, Gap, Macy’s, and J.C. Penney. And if that doesn’t strike you as problematic for retail store owners, then consider this: online retail sales have increased by more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://economics.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/d/22004D50545F6E152540EF23F30FEDED/2A6E6DC8366E6655F1E87EB810D8F10A">300</a> percent</span> over the past 19 years.</p>
<p>These patterns mean that retail store owners will need to learn how to integrate with the changes that are yet to come.</p>
<h2>Retail Tomorrow</h2>
<p>Evolving technology has brought with it the ability to shop online, and the growing demand to have everything connected and available at the touch of a button. Since the ‘immediacy’ side-effect is more predominant in younger generations, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that the future belongs to those younger groups of people.</p>
<p>Today more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2576/us-millennials-internet-usage-and-online-shopping/">70 percent of Millennials</a></span> have an Amazon Prime membership, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.bain.com/contentassets/0b0b0e19099a448e83af2fb53a5630aa/bain20media20pack_the_millennial_state_of_mind.pdf">Bain &amp; Co.</a></span> estimates that by 2025, Millennials and Gen Z will make up 45 percent of the world’s “personal luxury goods market.” This points to a future where online shopping is going to be an<span style="font-style: italic;"> even more </span>dominant force than it is now.</p>
<p>These statistics shouldn’t worry small retail business owners too much though, since Bain &amp; Co. also predicts that by 2025 roughly 75 percent of luxury goods purchases will still be made at a physical location. That simply means that consumers will want to see conveniences of advanced technology being incorporated into the ‘physical’ shopping experience.</p>
<p>When people enter physical retail stores in the coming years, they’ll encounter more examples of how technology is playing its role.</p>
<p>These innovations are already present in stores that let customers use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">online payment solutions</span> to make their purchases. More intriguing uses of technology are steadily being developed, including facial recognition technology that lets store associates know when another checkout line needs to be opened, and smartphone apps that allow you to see how furniture will fit in your home in augmented reality (AR).</p>
<p>Although it’s impossible to know for sure what the future will bring, there are ways to prepare&#8230;</p>
<h2>Strategies for Small Business Success in Retail</h2>
<p>How can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small retailers stay competitive</span> with companies like Amazon and Alibaba? Here are 5 easy ways to take advantage of being the ‘underdog’:</p>
<h3>1. Build personal relationships with customers</h3>
<p>Discounts and rewards are nice, but nothing has quite the same impact as offering stellar customer service. Go the extra mile to offer a product or service that best fits a customer’s needs. Pay attention to what your customer says &#8211; use their name when corresponding to show that they truly matter. Corporations will often automate their customer service, so take advantage of your human-touch.</p>
<h3>2. Find your niche</h3>
<p>Having all of the products that one might need in a single location is a huge advantage for customers who are looking to purchase a lot of different things without having to bounce from store to store. However, when customers are looking for one specific product (let’s say a top-notch wetsuit, for example), chances are they’d rather take advice from an expert (like an experienced scuba diver) instead of someone working at Amazon or Walmart.</p>
<p>If you find a niche and make your expertise clear, you’ll command more authority within that niche. Specialize your business so that you can draw in customers by offering specific content and wisdom that they won’t get from corporations.</p>
<h3>3. Reach out to other small businesses</h3>
<p>When the marketplace gets more competitive, small business owners often times work harder against one another. Instead, by establishing partnerships with other small businesses, it can become easier to stake your claim in your industry. See what sort of promotions or special deals can be worked out for the benefit of all participants. It will also help with earning a good reputation in the local community.</p>
<h3>4. Show your personality</h3>
<p>Big corporations will try to make themselves relatable to their customers, but how many people will feel a connection with carefully weighed slogans and stock photo advertisements? When it comes to being personable, the advantage clearly goes to small businesses who have a much easier time telling their unique story.</p>
<p>Research has shown that customers who feel a connection with a business on a personal level are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/02/26/lets-get-emotional-the-future-of-online-marketing/#294270ed4d0c">7 times more likely</a></span> to purchase from that company. Don’t underestimate the importance of showing your authentic self.</p>
<h3>5. Move fast</h3>
<p>Corporations put immense amounts of effort into perfecting their products and services, which is a big reason why those companies do so well. But, although every smart business owner should invest resources into optimizing their business plan, there’s a huge advantage to small businesses who will find it easier to make changes along the way.</p>
<p>If a corporation wants to change virtually any part of the business, there are tons of bureaucratic hoops that will need to be jumped through. When a small business wants to make a change, there are fewer people that need to be consulted, less paperwork, and so on. Use this benefit to find out what works for your business, and what doesn’t.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>While big corporations have the benefit of expendable resources, what they tend to focus on is ramping up the volume of sales. That leaves a lot of room for small business owners to make the most of the blind spots left over.</p>
<p>Where corporations can feel like faceless logos, small businesses can actually put a face (and a personality) to the name.</p>
<p>Where corporate retailers can cover a very broad range of goods, small businesses can specialize in a specific audience to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring in more customers</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, while changes take loads of effort for corporations to put into effect, small businesses have the ability to make adjustments more easily.</p>
<p>When you hear about ‘technology’ you think of smartphones and self-driving cars, but technology has had many more subtle yet profound impacts on the world of retail. Recent trends in the retail industry have shown a serious shift towards online shopping, along with the closing of thousands of physical retail locations. These changes have left many business owners wondering how to compete and stand out.</p>
<p>Challenges for small retail business owners are on the horizon, but there are steps that can be taken for them to keep their doors open. After all, it’s not the size of the dog in the fight—it’s the size of the fight in the dog that matters. Only time will tell how the retail industry will persist in these times of change, so be sure to stay up-to-date with market trends on a regular basis.</p>
