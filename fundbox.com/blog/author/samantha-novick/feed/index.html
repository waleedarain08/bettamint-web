Amazon, Warby Parker, Casper, and many other well-known brands that began exclusively online have transitioned to selling their products in real-world storefronts. You may be thinking about doing the same with your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>Interested in opening a physical store, but not sure how to get started? In this guide, we&#8217;ll show you how to get started with expanding your e-commerce store to physical retail.</p>
<h2>Why online retailers expand to brick and mortar stores</h2>
<p>Wondering if you should expand to a brick and mortar location? There are many reasons why you might want a physical store.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at why some well-known brands have been shifting their merchandise into traditional street-side businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Report/Worldwide-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-eMarketers-Estimates-20162021/2002090">eMarketer</a>, a research provider, shows only 10.1 percent of retail revenue in the U.S. is generated via e-commerce. The rest is generated in-store and offline.</li>
<li><a href="https://brizfeel.com/consumer-online-retail-shopping-behavior/">BrizFeel</a>, a water purification maker, surveyed 30,000 consumers aged 18 &#8211; 65 and found that 51 percent said not being able to touch, feel, or try a product was the biggest drawback of online shopping.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slickdeals-shares-new-survey-data-showing-americans-spend-324000-on-impulse-buys-in-their-lifetime-300601768.html">Slickdeals</a>, a consumer deal-sharing platform, surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers and found they spend an average of $5,400 annually on impulse buys in stores and at restaurants.</li>
<li><a href="http://possible.mindtree.com/rs/574-LHH-431/images/Mindtree%20Shopper%20Survey%20Report.pdf">Mindtree</a>, a global technology consulting company, surveyed 600 shoppers in the U.S. and found that when a sales associate assisted in-store, 43 percent were more likely to purchase a product and the transactions had 81 percent more value.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, consumers still enjoy purchasing products in brick and mortar stores. Whether it is for the experience or for the satisfaction of getting what they want immediately without paying for shipping, the answer is clear: brick and mortar is still a solid option for anyone who wants to make sales.</p>
<h2>How to open a brick and mortar store</h2>
<p>While the thought of opening your first retail store may be daunting, it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Here are some easy steps to get you started on your journey to turning your online store into an incredible offline retail experience.</p>
<h3>1. Find the best location for your retail store.</h3>
<p>Choosing the right location for your first store in the real world is crucial to the success of your business expansion. You want to choose a location that’s convenient for your ideal customer. Where do they live, work, and prefer to shop? Bring your store to them.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell luxury fashion online, you may want to lease a storefront in a high-end mall or outdoor shopping center. To help choose the right locations, you can use <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/73784">location analysis tools</a> and work with research firms to uncover insights into market demographics including the area&#8217;s average household income and age range, as well as traffic patterns and lifestyle data.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can do additional research by looking at surrounding retail stores and restaurants in the areas you are considering. Their clientele and popularity will give you an idea of who you can expect to walk into your business and how popular you can expect it to be.</p>
<h3>2. Know what will be in your lease and what you can negotiate.</h3>
<p>Once you find a few locations that may be perfect for your brick and mortar, you will need to figure out what will work for your leasing terms and budget. You may be able to negotiate a better rate based on how long you plan on staying in a particular location (generally, the longer the lease, the better the deal).</p>
<p>You will also want to get the details on what else is included with your lease payment and what you will be expected to pay for on your own. These expenses may include property taxes, insurance, maintenance of your space, common area maintenance, security, and basic utilities.</p>
<h3>3. Get your permits and licenses.</h3>
<p>Before you can start doing business in a retail store, you will need to get any city, state, and federal permits and licenses required in your area. These will vary based on the products and the services you plan to sell.</p>
<p>New York City, for example, offers a two-page <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_retail_store.pdf">retail store starter guide</a> and <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/wizard">step by step wizard</a>. Together, business owners can find the exact documents they need to get together before they have their store&#8217;s grand opening.</p>
<p>Research carefully to make sure you have your legal requirements covered in plenty of time.</p>
<h3>4. Decide on the merchandising and sales equipment.</h3>
<p>Your physical store environment should offer a great experience for your customers. Think about how you can give visitors the chance to touch and feel your products in a unique space that expresses your brand. You’ll probably also want to give customers the chance to get your most popular products and take them home the same day.</p>
<p>With these things in mind, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much merchandise and inventory do you want on hand for your grand opening?</li>
<li>How many clothing racks, counter displays, display tables, promotional displays, showcases, shelves, signage, slat walls, wall racks, and warehouse storage will you need for your merchandise?</li>
<li>How many POS systems do you plan to have to keep sales moving smoothly?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to your merchandising and sales equipment, you will need a system to manage your inventory and sales. If your e-commerce store uses a platform like Shopify, you can use it to manage your physical store&#8217;s point of sale hardware and inventory management.</p>
<h3>5. Consider how many people you will need to hire to run your store.</h3>
<p>Retailers that under-staff their stores can miss out on sales, according to insights provided by <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/retailers-are-understaffing-stores-and-losing-sales/513055/">RetailDive</a>. The last thing you want when creating a new in-store experience is for your customers to feel ignored because they can’t get the attention of a sales associate when they need one.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure how many people to hire for your brick and mortar store, conduct some research. Take a few trips to similar businesses in the area where you plan to set up shop. Visit during off-hours (like weekday mornings) and peak hours (like Saturday afternoons) to see how many people work on the sales floor and at the registers.</p>
<h3>6. Write your business plan to prepare to apply for funding.</h3>
<p>After you have done the research on your brick and mortar&#8217;s leasing options, permits and licenses, merchandising and inventory, and hiring expenses, you should have a solid idea of the amount of <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/business-financing/">business financing</a> you will need to make your brick and mortar store dream a reality. At this point, you are ready to write a business plan to show potential lenders how you plan to put their money to use.</p>
<p>Read our free <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to business financing</a> and learn about your options.</p>
<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a free guide on <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan">how to write a business plan</a>. You can also find great examples of retail store plans at <a href="https://www.bplans.com/retail_and_online_store_business_plan_templates.php">Bplans</a> for retailers of everything from art supplies to women&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>The goal of your business plan is to describe (in detail) your company, ideal customers, market viability, products and services, marketing and sales strategy, funding requirements, and financial projections. Your business plan will tell lenders <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/todays-retailers-can-compete-giants/">what makes your business stand out from the competition</a> and how you will use the funds to achieve specific objectives.</p>
<h2>A final word</h2>
<p>Opening a brick and mortar is just one possible avenue for growth, and it’s important to take the time to compare which investment opportunity will have the biggest impact on your bottom line. While having a physical storefront isn’t right for every business, there are a ton of potential benefits that could make the endeavor worthwhile for you.</p>

However, the costs of taking on big projects plus daily operations can quickly add up, leaving you with business debt.</p>
<p>At times, you might feel stressed by the amount of capital you owe. If you’re planning to reduce your debt, you can get your total under control by breaking it down into manageable parts. Here’s an action plan you can use to stay in control of your business debt.</p>
<h2>Evaluate your budget</h2>
<p>Sure, you might have done the hard work already and put together a strict budget but, if the costs are mounting, it may be time to re-think your spending.</p>
<p>The first step in doing this is probably the scariest: you will need to figure out the amount of your total debt. While that number can seem daunting, you need to be clear about it.</p>
<p>Once you understand your financial situation, you can move on to evaluating your current cash flow, and forecasting future cash flow. With a clear view of your cash flow, you can then compare what you’re earning with what you owe.</p>
<p>Then, it’s time to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/">rewrite your budget</a></span>. You may only need to make small adjustments or you might have to make a significant overhaul. Whatever the total, you will want to create a new category for paying back your debt. Even if you can only afford a little to start, you will need a budgetary line specifically dedicated to debt payments. Think of it as a new regular monthly expense.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Grab one of these <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/">7 free budgeting templates</a> to get a head start on evaluating and tracking your debt payments.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Restructure your debt</h2>
<p>Just because you started by accruing one type of debt — or multiple, harder to manage debts — does not mean you are locked into that current structure forever. You may be able to restructure your debt in a way that makes it easier to track, manage, and repay.</p>
<p>There are two primary methods to restructure your debt by taking out a new loan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Debt Refinancing</li>
<li>Debt Consolidation</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to refinance, you’re essentially swapping out existing short-term debt with a lower-rate business loan. Once you secure new <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/business-funding/">business funding</a></span> with the lower interest rate, you use the proceeds to pay off your existing high-interest debt. Interest charges can keep you in debt for much longer than needed, and even lowering your rate by a few percentage points can save you some much-needed funds in the long run.</p>
<p>Debt consolidation, however, merges multiple loans together into one new loan: a single bill, due date and interest rate to keep track of. To consolidate business debt, you would take that full value of your existing debt (or the debt that you’d like to consolidate), so you know exactly how much you need to pay off as a whole. Don’t forget to read the fine print on your loan agreements as some lenders charge prepayment penalties which can affect the total amount you need to borrow. If you’re approved, you then would use the proceeds to pay off your existing loans, simplifying your life with a single monthly payment to manage—and making it easier to budget moving forward. Plus, if you’re <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/consolidating-business-debt/">consolidating multiple forms of high-interest debt</a></span>, you may be able to also reap the benefits of a lower interest rate.</p>
<h2>Choose a debt reduction strategy</h2>
<p>You can also explore some clever strategies to reduce your business debt. Here are a few popular strategies that business owners typically use:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">“Stacking” or “Avalanching”</span>: After you have a clear idea of what you owe, what you bring in and what minimum payments you can cover, you can opt to “stack” your debts. Essentially, this means looking at your debt with the highest interest rate, and seeing what you can allocate to pay above the minimum payment there. Once you pay off the debt with the highest interest rate, you’d then tackle the debt with the second-highest interest rate, and so on and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spartan Strategy</span>: This is a bare-bones, essentials-only plan for spending where you specifically call out what you will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> be spending any money on until your debt is gone. It may seem harsh, but it’s undoubtedly effective if reducing debt quickly is your goal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Percentage Strategy</span>: Fairly straightforward, but rather than putting it in terms of X amount of dollars, this strategy has you declare the percentage of profit that will always be solely dedicated to paying debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an idea of what strategy makes the most sense for your business, create a deadline. With the information gathered from your budget and the accompanying debt reduction strategy you’ve chosen to employ, you should be able to calculate just how long it will take you to be debt-free. Break down your timeline with certain monthly, quarterly, and yearly targets. Having it all planned out makes it easier to manage and stick to a plan.</p>
<h2>Negotiate your debt terms</h2>
<p>Consider calling your creditors directly to negotiate. They may be willing to work with you to help you repay your debt on a schedule that works for you. Speaking with creditors directly can allow you to explore possibilities like lower interest rates, payment extensions, debt consolidation, and more. They may not accommodate you, but it can be worth asking. You don&#8217;t know until you investigate your options. Some creditors may provide a grace period or be able to offer repayment plan options that ease the burden and help you succeed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/write-hardship-letter-small-business-40192.html">Writing a hardship letter</a></span> explaining the situation can also be beneficial to your conversations with your creditor.</p>
<p>If handling this process is too complicated or not possible for you, you may also work with a debt restructuring firm.</p>
<p>Restructuring firms typically will negotiate with creditors and collection agencies on your behalf, for a fee, and may be able to secure more favorable modifications to your existing agreements or even entirely new terms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extending the terms of your loan to reduce monthly payments</li>
<li>Negotiating reasonable payment terms with a lower interest rate that fit your budget</li>
<li>Mediating <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/exploring-debt-restructuring-options-carol-tice/">a settlement</a></span> where you pay an agreed-on lump sum that is smaller than what you owe, and the rest of your debt is forgiven</li>
</ul>
<p>When you hire a firm to take over negotiations, according to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/managing-debt/5-ways-to-reduce-small-business-debt/">QuickBooks</a></span>, you will likely need to sign a written contract and may be required to set up automatic withdrawals from your bank account to ensure you keep up with your newly established terms. This is why it’s crucial to be honest about how much you can realistically afford to pay on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>There are several<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-find-a-small-business-mentor/"> online and local organizations</a></span> that offer free business counseling and can help guide you through the process and walk you through your options, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find/?type=Small%20Business%20Development%20Center">Small Business Development Centers</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.score.org/">SCORE</a></span>.</p>
<p>By employing some of these strategies and holding yourself accountable, you can begin to make progress in paying off your <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-it-makes-sense-to-take-on-debt/">business debt</a>. By establishing a track record of borrowing responsibly and paying back your business debt on time, you&#8217;ll improve your credit profile and FICO score. That will help put yourself in a better position for the next time you decide to borrow funds.</p>

While a simple word exchange may sound harmless enough, the meanings are drastically different and can have huge implications. If you run a business and are considering financing now or in the future, it is a good idea for you to know what each term means and what makes them different.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is an interest rate?</h2>
<p>Interest rate is what a lender charges to borrow money – it is expressed as a percentage of the principal (i.e. the amount of money you have borrowed and have yet to pay back).</p>
<p>While interest rates are often presented as annual rates, that does not mean they are the same as APR, though it is easy to see how this might get confusing.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re considering a small business loan, it&#8217;s smart to separate interest rate from APR, since the two values not only can vary drastically but mean very different things.<br />
<a id="WhatAPR"></a></p>
<h2>What is APR?</h2>
<p>APR is a figure that tells you the <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/apr_key_to_small_business_loan_offer/">true cost per year of borrowing money</a>. How? Unlike the interest rate, APR factors in any additional fees and charges into the equation. As such, the APR is generally higher than the interest rate.<br />
<a id="HowCalculate"></a></p>
<h2>How do I calculate my APR?</h2>
<p>Calculating APR often sounds more intimidating than it really is. In fact, most of the time your lender will provide you with the loan’s APR (and if they don’t, it’s probably a sign that there’s something fishy). However, if you are just given an interest rate (or an interest rate plus fees), it is helpful to know how to figure out this math.</p>
<p>There are many online loan calculators that can help you determine the true cost of a loan, but you can use this formula to determine the rate on your own. You will need to know your loan’s interest rate, the total amount you are borrowing, the total cost of – if any – fees, and what the repayment terms are.</p>
<h3>Monthly Payment</h3>
<p>You can find this using the following formula in an Excel spreadsheet:</p>
<p><em>=PMT(interest rate/months, the total number of months of your loan’s duration, the value of the loan [plus fees])</em></p>
<h3>Monthly Rate</h3>
<p>After determining your monthly payment in terms of dollars, you can use that number to figure out the monthly rate.</p>
<p>In another spreadsheet cell, use <em>=RATE(total number of months of your loan’s duration, monthly payment as a negative, your loan’s current value)</em></p>
<p>You should get a decimal value.</p>
<h3>Annual Rate – Decimal</h3>
<p>Step three is easy: multiply the monthly rate decimal you got in the last step by 12.</p>
<h3>APR (Annual Rate Percentage)</h3>
<p>Now you take that decimal amount from step three and multiply it by 100 to determine the equivalent percentage value.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a spreadsheet handy, you can <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apr.asp">also find APR</a> by dividing the total amount of your interest plus fees by the principal loan amount.</p>
<p>Then, take that number and divide it by the total number of days in the duration of the loan.</p>
<p>Next, multiply that value by 365, and then multiply that number by 100 to determine the annual rate percentage.<br />
<a id="WhyImportant"></a></p>
<h2>Why is APR important?</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve done the work to understand APR, here’s why it’s so important.</p>
<p>APR is what allows you to understand the true cost of your loan. Since it includes all interest and fees, you get a clearer picture of all of the expenses associated with your loan and how much you’ll really pay.</p>
<p>APR is also one of the most useful metrics for comparing multiple forms of business funding. Depending on the options you’re considering, financing options may come with different fees and payment structures that would be otherwise hard to compare.</p>
<p>For example, one loan offer may have an attractively low-sounding interest rate, but if it’s compounded more frequently (daily as opposed to monthly) or comes with a collection of additional associated charges, it may be significantly more expensive than you initially thought.</p>
<p>APR is so important that most credit lenders are now legally required to disclose the rate to borrowers, thanks to the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumer-protection/truth-in-lending/index-truth-in-lending.html">Truth in Lending Act</a>, which was designed to protect consumers against inaccurate billing or credit practices that are unfair. While an interest rate will give you a quick version of what your loan will cost you, the APR accounts for more details.<br />
<a id="FlawAPR"></a></p>
<h2>A (sometimes) fatal flaw with APR</h2>
<p>When shopping for a loan, many would-be borrowers compare APR numbers and simply choose the lowest one. “Lower is better” sounds like an easy assumption to make, but it’s not always true.</p>
<p>The loan with the lowest APR is <em>not</em> always the loan with the lowest <em>actual</em> long-term costs.</p>
<p>Why not? The lower-APR loan could actually be more expensive than a higher-APR loan, based on certain assumptions in the formula used to calculate it.</p>
<p>For example, consider the term length of the loan in question. APR assumes that you’ll pay off the loan over the full term, and not a year sooner. A 30-year mortgage, for example, sometimes comes loaded with fees up front, which the APR assumes will be spread over 30 years. If you were to pay it off sooner, your APR would go up, since you’d need to spread those initial costs over fewer years.</p>
<p>And what about those fees? APR calculations do account for certain fees or third-party costs associated with the loan, but some of those assumptions might not be correct if any of those fee amounts change. Additional fees may not all be accounted for in the APR calculation, making the APR lower and misstating the true all-in cost.</p>
<p>Finally, a single APR number isn’t very useful for projecting the costs of any adjustable-rate loan. Since the interest rate may change over the loan term, any APR number will change as well.</p>
<p>When comparing APRs and before choosing a financing option, try to keep these facts in mind. Calculate a few different scenarios to make sure that you’re making an informed choice.</p>
<p>Interest rate and APR are both important numbers to know and take into consideration when applying for any small business financing. Armed with the nuances around what each of them means, you should be able to more confidently choose the terms that are best for your business.</p>

Like your business credit score, debt service coverage ratio is an indicator of how likely you are to repay loans, lines of credit and other debt obligations.</p>
<p>Your business&#8217;s DSCR isn&#8217;t set in stone and there are a few things you can do to improve it and increase your odds of qualifying for financing. Here&#8217;s what you need to know about debt service coverage ratio, and why it matters for small business financing.</p>
<h2>What is your Debt Service Coverage Ratio?</h2>
<p>DSCR refers to the amount of available cash your business has on hand compared to the amount of debt it has outstanding. It&#8217;s a way to determine whether your business has the financial capacity to take on additional debt and keep up with debt repayments.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a very simple formula for calculating DSCR. It looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Annual net operating income/Annual debt service = Debt service coverage ratio</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Net operating income</span>: This is revenue from your business minus operating expenses and your costs of goods sold (COGS).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Annual debt service</span>: This is money required over the course of the year to repay debts including loan principal, loan interest, loan fees, and, if applicable, lease payments.</p>
<p>For example, if your business has an annual net operating income of $500,000 and annual debt payments of $100,000, your DSCR would be 5. Essentially, this means you could pay your debts five times over from your business income.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need to aim for a number that high, however. According to Nav, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.nav.com/resource/debt-service-coverage-ratio/">a DSCR above 1.25 is considered good</a></span> and sends the signal to lenders that you&#8217;ll be able to repay what you borrow.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> You can swap out EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for net operating income in the DSCR formula. To calculate EBITDA, subtract all business expenses from annual revenues, then add in taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization.</p>
<h3>What type of business debt is included in the DSCR formula?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re estimating your DSCR in anticipation of applying for a business loan, it&#8217;s important to factor in every type of debt your business has. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/term-loans/">Term loans</a></span> owed to banks, credit unions and online lenders</li>
<li>Short-term loans, including merchant cash advances, <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/purchase-order-financing/">purchase order financing</a>, and <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/construction-loans-financing/">inventory financing</a></li>
<li>Invoice factoring or financing</li>
<li>Real estate and equipment leases</li>
<li><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/">Business lines of credit</a></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/">Business credit cards</a></span></li>
<li>Income tax debts paid under an installment agreement</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re in doubt about whether to include a specific debt, it&#8217;s better to err on the side of caution. Any debts that directly affect your business cash flow should be factored into your estimates, as lenders will do the same when calculating DSCR.</p>
<h2>Why is your Debt Service Coverage Ratio important?</h2>
<p>Your DSCR is important to lenders because it&#8217;s one tool they use to gauge risk. Lenders want as much reassurance as possible that your business can repay what you&#8217;ve borrowed.</p>
<p>Every financer sets different guidelines on the minimum DSCR required for a loan. Some, for example, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/debt-service-coverage-ratio-how-to-calculate-and-improve-your-businesss-dscr/#What_Is_A_Good_Debt_Service_Coverage_Ratio">require a minimum of 1.15 while others may increase it to 1.25 or higher</a></span>. And you may have to demonstrate a better DSCR when borrowing larger amounts of money for your business.</p>
<p>But which lenders use DSCR? Not all of them do but the Small Business Administration definitely <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/Chapter_4_Credit_Standards_Chart-1B.pdf">takes it into account for 7(a) loans over $350,000</a></span>. Banks and online financers, including peer-to-peer lenders, may also check your debt service coverage ratio.</p>
<p>Aside from knowing why it matters to lenders, it&#8217;s also helpful for you to understand your DSCR before taking on any new loans. Specifically, calculating your debt service coverage ratio can tell you if it&#8217;s wise to <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-it-makes-sense-to-take-on-debt/">take on new debt</a> to your business.</p>
<h2>Interpreting your DSCR</h2>
<p>Understanding your DSCR requires doing some simple math and analyzing the results. You just need to know your annual net operating income (or EBITDA) and debt service numbers.</p>
<p>Say, for example, that your business has a net operating income of $150,000 and total debt service of $150,000. In that scenario, your DSCR would be 1. That means you&#8217;re generating enough income to repay your debts, but you may not have much flexibility with your cash flow.</p>
<p>Now, assume that taking on a new loan would increase your annual debt service to $155,000. That would recalculate your DSCR to 0.97, meaning you&#8217;d be able to meet 97% of your debt obligations. In that scenario, taking on more debt could be problematic if you&#8217;re not simultaneously increasing your net operating income.</p>
<p>If you were to grow net operating income to $200,000, for instance, having $155,000 in debt service would result in a DSCR of 1.29. This means your business has enough cash flow to pay debts while also meeting other financial needs or goals.</p>
<h2>How to improve your Debt Service Coverage Ratio</h2>
<p>Before you apply for a loan or another type of business funding, consider what you can do to make your DSCR more favorable in a lender&#8217;s eyes. There are two broad options for improving debt service coverage ratio: increase revenues or decrease expenses.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, you might consider adding new products or services or expanding your marketing reach to connect with a new client base. Raising prices is another possibility if you can do so strategically. Or you may consider entering into a partnership with another business in the same or a different niche to run a joint sales promotion.</p>
<p>With expenses, it&#8217;s helpful to thoroughly review everything your business spends money on monthly. Your accountant can help you go over the books and take a granular look at which operating expenses you may be able to reduce or eliminate. They can also help you determine whether it&#8217;s possible to retire some of your existing debt to remove those payments from the DSCR equation altogether.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Don&#8217;t skip checking your DSCR if you need small business financing. Understanding how lenders will evaluate your business&#8217;s financials can help you put your best foot forward as you prepare to apply for a loan.</p>
