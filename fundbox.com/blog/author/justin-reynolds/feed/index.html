<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do you need to figure out how to form your business as a legal entity, you also need to determine how you’re going to market your products and services effectively, who you’re going to hire, and what your ideal customer looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your business starts to grow, more questions come up. When is the right time to expand headcount? When, if ever, is the right time to look for investors or other forms of small business financing, like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? When should you differentiate your product portfolio? When should you move into a new market? When should you rebrand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list goes on and on, and it never ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you’re not the first person to start and grow a successful business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own—and letting the discouragement that comes with things not working out perfectly derail your vision and momentum—why not learn from folks who’ve been in your exact position before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to get some ideas about how to improve your small business, podcasts are the perfect place to find inspiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is our listing of some of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/28-must-hear-podcasts-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best small business podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today and why you might want to start thinking about launching your own podcast at some point in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What podcasts do entrepreneurs listen to?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in checking out some of the best business podcasts, you’ve come to the right place. Without further ado, here are 10 of the best podcasts for entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. The Leslie Samuel Show</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a business that depends on digital? Subscribe to </span><a href="https://iamlesliesamuel.com/bloggingwithleslie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leslie Samuel Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses on how to build resilient online businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie started his career as a high school science and math teacher. He always wanted to teach at the collegiate level, but he didn’t want to get a PhD. So, he created biology videos, posted them on YouTube, and built a devout following—which, ironically, ultimately landed him a professorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward to today, and Leslie’s left the classroom, building an online business to spend more time with his family. The Leslie Samuel Show, which has nearly 400 episodes, can teach you how to do the same. Recent episodes explore how to build sales funnels, how to overcome common entrepreneurial struggles, and how to build a successful digital agency.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Online Marketing Made Easy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Porterfield started out working a 9 to 5 just like most of us. Now, she’s the CEO of a multi-million business. Luckily for you, she shares all of her secrets on her podcast, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/online-marketing-made-easy-with-amy-porterfield/id594703545?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Marketing Made Easy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Amy’s released nearly 400 episodes of the podcast, which gives listeners step-by-step processes they can follow to build incredible online businesses. Tune in to learn more about topics like finding the sweet spot between free and paid content, how to create a high converting sales page, how to re-engage your email list, and whether it makes sense to move to a four-day workweek.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. My Wakeup Call</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Mark Goulston is a psychiatrist, executive coach, and best-selling author. He’s also the host of the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-wakeup-call-with-dr-mark-goulston/id1439752757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Wakeup Call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the name suggests, Dr. Goulston’s podcast highlights instances where people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">woke up </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after an unpleasant experience and improved their lives because of it. To date, he’s released more than 200 episodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent guests include Mike Garson, a Grammy-nominated composer who was David Bowie’s pianist; Lisa Tamati, an ultraendurance athlete and author; and Tim Ringgold, a music therapist and host of the Reduce Your Stress podcast.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beth Buelow is a professional coach, facilitator, mediator, author, and speaker. She’s the host of </span><a href="https://theintrovertentrepreneur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which—you guessed it—caters to folks who aren’t particularly outgoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoiler alert: Just because you’re not an extrovert doesn’t mean you can’t crush it as an entrepreneur. Don’t believe it? Ask </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/23-amazingly-successful-introverts-throughout-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these famous introverts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Larry Page, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Beth’s aired nearly 175 episodes of her podcast. Recent episodes touch upon how to fully embrace your introverted nature, how to reveal your hidden brilliance, and how to discover your customer’s secret language.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. HBR IdeaCast</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBR IdeaCast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast needs no introduction. Each week, the fine folks over at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">put out a new episode of the show, which features the best and brightest minds in the business world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, more than 750 episodes have aired. Recent shows focus on what people like David Bowie and Beyonce can teach us about innovation, why it’s time to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with folks instead of simply networking, and how hybrid work is here to stay—and what that means for businesses like yours.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.  The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Vaynerchuk is a CEO, investor, speaker, and vlogger who’s the host of </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which has an impressive catalog of almost 2,000 episodes to date. (If you’ve never heard about Gary, take a few minutes to </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read about his background</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it’s worth it!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for an eclectic podcast hosted by someone who understands what it’s like to be you, this is a great place to start. Recent episodes focus on why it’s not worth wasting time for a bigger paycheck, why you should never fake who you are, and achieving the perfect blend of patience and tenacity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How I Built This</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by Guy Raz, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How I Built This</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an engaging podcast that explores the stories behind some of today’s most successful businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Guy’s released more than 350 episodes. Tune in to learn the origin stories of companies like Mailchimp, Numi Organic Tea, Casper, JetBlue, and Zillow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure you have time to spare. This is a longer podcast, with episodes usually clocking in somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Masters of Scale</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid Hoffmann might know a thing or two about how to operate effectively at scale. After all, he co-founded LinkedIn, and he’s currently a partner at Greylock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he’s also the host of the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which explores how businesses scale over 200-plus episodes and counting. Since its launch, Reid’s talked to CEOs of companies like Nike, Netflix, Starbucks, Slack, and Spanx to learn more about what they’ve done to get to where they are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check it out, and who knows? Maybe you’ll end up as a guest one day.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. The Tim Ferriss Show</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might know him as the best-selling author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 4-Hour Workweek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools of Titans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribe of Mentors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for inspiration from some of the most interesting and successful professionals today—from fields ranging from sports to investing to chess—look no further. Recent guests include Chris Bosh on how to reinvent yourself, Suleika Jaouad on the invaluable nature of road trips, and Chip Wilson on building the Lululemon sportswear brand. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Impact Theory</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of writing, the show has  more than 810 episodes. Recent guests include actor Danny Trejo, musician Jewel, politician and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy. </span></p>
<h2>Fundbox Forward Podcast</h2>
<p>Also, check out our own small business podcast, <a href="https://fundbox.buzzsprout.com/1030801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fundbox Forward</strong></a>, featuring interviews with small business experts and even Fundbox customers who share their insights on small business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I start a business podcast?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, not every business needs a podcast. For example, if you own a local </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">house painting business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food truck operation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your time might be better spent focusing on sales and customer success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, if you’re an expert at what you do and are interested in helping other people follow in your path, a podcast can be a great vehicle to make that happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue the above examples, why not launch a podcast teaching other people how to become expert house painters or food truck owners? You never know when such a podcast might take on a life of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many other kinds of businesses—including marketing agencies, software companies, and even local accounting firms—a podcast might even be a no-brainer. When you record content regularly, you end up with a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library of podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that serves as great marketing content your audience can discover at any time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I start a podcast for my business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite what you might think, starting a podcast doesn’t have to be a massive undertaking. All you need is a name, a theme, a good microphone, and a good script to get started. You’ll also need to determine a show format (e.g., will you interview guests or just tell stories?). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re up for the challenge, you should be able to produce your first episode on your own without too many headaches. A word to the wise: If you take this route, the quality might not be where you wished it were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re really committed to podcasting for your business, you might be best off outsourcing production to a company that specializes in podcasts. Record a show, pass it off to the pros for polishing, and get back to do what you do best: serving your customers to the best of your abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, here’s to discovering podcasts that help you get to the next level in your entrepreneurial journey—and potentially launching your own show to inspire the next generation to do the same.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="511" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1837501381-768x511.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="caliper and money isolated on white background" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1837501381-768x511.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shutterstock_1837501381.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many entrepreneurs go into business because they’re passionate about their craft and they love helping customers. Still, at the end of the day, all small business owners are focused on the same thing: making money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every industry is different and no two companies within any sector are the same, shrewd businesses are always focused on strengthening their bottom line and increasing profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most small business owners can’t just open their doors and expect to be swimming in cash overnight. According to the </span><a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-time-reach-profitability-start-up-company-2318.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houston Chronicle</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average business isn’t profitable until its second or third year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to profitability starts with mastering cash flow. Unfortunately, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/profit-margins-and-cash-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 percent of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have cash flow problems every year. Since cash flow problems are one of the main reasons companies go out of business, entrepreneurs need to focus intently on maximizing profit margins month in and month out. Otherwise, the cash flow river can dry up quickly, making your dreams of building a successful small business that much harder to achieve.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate your profit margin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to optimize your profit margin, you first need to figure out how to measure it. Luckily, there’s a handy formula you can use to calculate your profit margin: </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profit margin = Net income / Revenue x 100</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’ve earned $100,000 on $800,000 of revenue, your profit margin is 12.5%. But what if your margins were 30%? All of a sudden, you’re hauling in $240,000 on that same $800,000 in revenue because you’ve figured out how to optimize your margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, the better your profit margins are, the more money you’ll make as a small business owner.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is considered a healthy profit margin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every business is different, there are some general guidelines as to what healthy margins look like. According to the </span><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/profit-margin/#:~:text=You%20may%20be%20asking%20yourself,a%205%25%20margin%20is%20low." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate Finance Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 5 percent profit margins are considered low, while 10 percent margins are average and 20 percent margins are high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, just because your small business might have a higher profit margin than another company doesn’t mean you’re making more money than they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let’s imagine you made a 20 percent margin on $250,000 in revenue. At the end of the day, you’re putting $50,000 into your pocket. Not bad! Now, let’s imagine someone makes a 10 percent margin on $1 million in revenue. That entrepreneur is stacking away $100,000 each year. Their margin is half of yours, but they’re pulling in twice as much cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, while profit margins might measure the health of your business, they have no impact on your overall earning potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth noting that different kinds of businesses require different margins to work. For example, a fast-food restaurant might be perfectly fine getting by with small margins due to the volume of transactions and overall revenue. On the other hand, an antique store that relies on a few high-ticketed sales a month might need higher margins to maintain profitability and keep the lights on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, margins for many businesses tend to shrink as they scale. To illustrate, imagine you decide to start a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">house painting business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by yourself. You’ve been crushing it and are on track to bring in $60,000 this year. Since your expenses are low, you plan on taking in a whopping 75 percent margin on that revenue, pocketing $45,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more and more work piles up, you decide to hire a new part-time employee. The following year, your team of two is able to double that revenue to $120,000. After paying your employee and covering all of your expenses, you’re left with $60,000—good for a 50 percent margin. While your margin is one-third lower than it was last year, your take-home earnings are one-third higher.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What business has the best profit margin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data from NYU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some of the industries with the biggest profit margins include regional banks (23.79 percent), financial services companies (20.13 percent), semiconductors (20.49 percent), software (20.3 percent), and investments and asset management (19.51 percent). Of course, within each of these industries, there are companies that beat those margins and those that fall short of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though some industries might lend themselves to better margins than others, you shouldn’t go into business simply to chase profit margins (starting a semiconductor company might also be a bit of a challenge, too). If you want your company to be successful, you may want to open a business that you’re passionate about.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What industry has the lowest profit margin?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same NYU data shows that there are a number of industries that are not profitable at all. For example, the average internet-based software company has a profit margin that stands at -5.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out that when your business is fueled by venture capital and shares of stock, your business can turn out perfectly fine despite years of losing money. Case in point? </span><a href="https://qz.com/1196256/it-took-amazon-amzn-14-years-to-make-as-much-net-profit-as-it-did-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is currently worth more than $1.5 trillion at time of this writing, didn’t start cranking out significant profits until 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for industries that have lower profit margins that are still making money? Some examples include restaurants (5.69 percent), home furnishings (4.63 percent), transportation (3.88 percent), farming (3.81 percent), and general retail (2.79 percent).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you grow your business with low margins?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While profit margins won’t make or break your business on their own, the better your margins are, the more money you’ll have leftover at the end of the year. That being the case, you’ll want to focus on doing what you can to improve your margins on a regular basis. With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the ways you can improve your profit margins—accelerating cash flow while bringing home more money.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Figure out where to cut costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you scrutinize your operations, chances are you’ll find some places where you can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce spending and cut costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you getting the best deal on your internet service? Are you paying too much for electricity and heating? Are you paying too much for the supplies you need to keep your business humming along?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From time to time, make sure to analyze to see whether you’re getting the best deals or whether it makes sense to switch to other providers who can meet your needs at a lower price point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you may also want to  look into opening a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that your company can tap into on an as-needed basis. That way, if the going gets tough, you’ll have cash reserves on hand to weather the storm and keep operations humming along.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Rethink your prices</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costs increase over time. That’s just the way it is. We see this in our grocery bills, our cable bills, and our tax bills. Despite this, many small business owners are hesitant to raise their own prices. They fear that, by doing so, they will alienate their customers and perhaps even lose business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet an easy way to boost profit margins is to increase your prices. If demand for your products and services keeps increasing, the cost of doing business keeps increasing, or your prices have stayed the same for a long time, it might be time to boost your prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need some tips on how to raise prices effectively? </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-signs-that-its-time-to-raise-your-prices-and-3-ways-to-do-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out this guide to pricing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Eliminate low-margin offerings</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to improve your profit margins is by focusing on high-margin products and services and ceasing to offer those that don’t bring in as much money. For example, if you run a landscaping business that has both corporate and residential accounts, you might decide to stop catering to residential clients altogether and instead focus on the more lucrative corporate contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A word to the wise: Don’t eliminate offerings overnight. Give your customers enough of a head’s up so they can find a substitute solution. Otherwise, they might get upset with you, and your business’ reputation could take a hit.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Implement customer loyalty programs </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though </span><a href="http://www.crmtrends.com/loyalty.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loyal customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may only account for 15 percent of your customer base, they can be responsible for as much as 70 percent of your revenue. To this end, one way you can boost your margins is by implementing customer loyalty programs that reward loyal customers for their repeat business. For example, delis and sandwich shops often have buy “10 sandwiches, get one free” programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might require some out-of-the-box thinking, but you should be able to come up with some type of loyalty program at your business, which can help increase revenues and drive higher margins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s to a healthy profit margin for your small business—and one that you continue to fine-tune over time!</span></p>

Amazon, which </span><a href="https://qz.com/1196256/it-took-amazon-amzn-14-years-to-make-as-much-net-profit-as-it-did-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017/#:~:text=For%20a%20sense%20of%20scale,years%20as%20a%20public%20company." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn’t profitable for 14 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, started as an online marketplace for books—and we all know what it’s become since. McDonald’s </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/markets/history-of-mcdonalds-15128096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">started as a single restaurant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in San Bernardino, California. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every big business starts as a small one. By getting into business for the right reasons, forming a strong business development plan and sticking to it, hiring the right people, and staying the course, you’ll be well on your way to building a successful business empire before you know it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the most successful small businesses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, the success of a small business relies on a confluence of factors. Not only does the business need to solve a specific need—whether that’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/preparing-business-tax-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax preparation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ways-marketing-agencies-can-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing functions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—it also needs to provide exceptional services at agreeable price points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the chances you get the results you’re hoping for, find your niche, and try to build a business that you’re absolutely passionate about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By doing so, you’ll be solving a very pressing need. Plus, your enthusiasm will permeate through all that you do, and your team will feed off of that energy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the first thing to do when starting a business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start a small business, you need to conduct market research to make sure your idea is worth pursuing. You also have to pick a name, figure out pricing, and take care of legal requirements—like forming an LLC, securing requisite certifications, and obtaining whatever insurance your business requires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your business will only be as strong as the people that work for it, you need to make sure that you hire the right team. Do your due diligence, thoroughly vet candidates, and pay them well—perhaps even more than what competitors are paying, if you can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes from growing a small business into a big one, all of the above is table stakes—just enough to get you started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is to create a small business that will one day be massive, you first need to develop a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that helps you increase brand awareness, engage your audience, and attract new customers. With the right approach, it’s possible to build an incredible following that’s with you for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, you can’t just open your doors for the first time and expect customers to come flocking in. Whatever the nature of your business is, you’ll need an effective marketing strategy to take it to the next level—and certainly to realize its full potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin to put your marketing strategy together to grow your small business, it’s important to understand the four proven strategies that lead to organic business growth.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the four small business growth strategies?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As every small business owner knows too well, it’s pretty much impossible to knock it out of the park on the first day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re first starting out, it’s all about figuring out how to bring in more money than you&#8217;re dishing out to keep the lights on. But once you’ve conquered the first year and see your financial situation improve, chances are you’ll want to figure out how to do even better moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, here are four strategies for organic business growth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Product development</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Coca-Cola was just starting out, the company had a single product: a tasty sugary water drink we all know as Coke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward to today, and the company now sells over </span><a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs/how-many-brands-does-coca-cola-have#:~:text=coca%2Dcola%2Dhave-,The%20Coca%2DCola%20Company%20is%20a%20total%20beverage%20company%2C%20offering,in%20more%20than%20200%20countries." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 brands of beverages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, at the time of this writing, boasts a market cap in excess of $232 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin to think about taking your business to the next level, it’s worth considering whether your business can grow its bottom line by developing new products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of this article, we talked about the genesis of Google, Amazon, and McDonalds. Over time, all three of those companies have developed a considerable amount of products that serve the same market, which has helped them grow into the juggernauts they are today.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Market development</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to grow your small business into a larger one is by doing whatever you can to tap into new markets. Just like Amazon moved from books to </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064BFJ3W/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally everything else</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your business can begin targeting a whole new market of customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a successful restaurant owner might decide to open a second location in another town to tap into a new customer base. Or, they might even opt to open up a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food truck business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cater to mobile clientele.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, market development is all about spreading your wings and trying to sell your products or services into a wider geography or category of consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">painting business </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">might expand to the next county and a residential landscaper might try to land commercial accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know your business better than anyone else does. Spend some time thinking about the additional markets your company may be able to tap into, and act on your findings.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Market penetration </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For argument’s sake, let’s say you’re launching a new barber shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the easiest ways to grow a business from the outset is by embracing the market penetration strategy—pricing your products or services aggressively low to entice customers to give your business a shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your competitor charges $30 for a haircut, you charge $18, and you will price-conscious shoppers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thinking, here, is straightforward: Take customers away from your competitors with attractive prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, once you’ve established your brand, you can gradually increase your prices to get them back to whatever the market commands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious what market penetration looks like in action? Amazon once took a </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/emails-detail-amazons-plan-to-crush-a-startup-rival-with-price-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 million loss on diapers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent a startup rival from capturing digital market share!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Diversification </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, supercharging your business growth requires drastic measures. And that’s where the diversification strategy enters the mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At is core, diversification is about designing new products for a new market. It’s about reinventing the wheel entirely—and hoping that your pivot is successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular examples of the diversification strategy is Nokia, a Finnish conglomerate that started out as a paper mill and has since pivoted to network equipment, mobile radios, mobile phones, and personal computers. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Nokia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about Nokia’s evolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’re familiar with the four different strategies for business growth, it’s time to pick the one that makes sense for your unique circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But picking a strategy isn’t the end all be all. To get the results you’re looking for, you need to execute on it successfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up next, we’ll examine some tips to keep in mind as you begin growing your small business into an enormous one.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips to keep in mind as you focus on business growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say, it takes 20 years of hard work to become an overnight success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you can’t snap your fingers and will succeed into existence, you can develop a framework that significantly increases the chances you achieve your goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, here are three tips to keep in mind as you scale your idea into a fully baked organization.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get feedback from the people who matter most</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason we all know the saying that tells us the customer is always right: They are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to generate organic business growth is by regularly soliciting feedback from your customers—and implementing the best of their ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does this help you refine your offerings to meet customer expectations, it also engages your base by showing them that you’re not only interested in what they have to say—but you’re actually paying attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect feedback at regular intervals, and your business will be in a much stronger position because of it. It’s that simple.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a financing option in place</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There comes a time in the life of every small business when an extra injection of cash is necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some situations, you might need money to cover operating expenses after some unexpected event derailed your plans (e.g., </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In others, you might want some extra cash to invest in growth opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the case may be, growth-oriented small business owners need to have fast access to cash on standby. That way, when the circumstances warrant it, they will be able to quickly get the money they need to make the next move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about starting a new business and imagine you might need an extra cash infusion at some point in the future, you may want to look into </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you might also want to secure a business line of credit. By doing so, you’ll have access to a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving credit line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can tap into on an as-needed basis. Replenish the credit line as funds come in to stay in good standing, and draw against it only when you need to.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider strategic partnerships</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no rule that says you have to grow your business on your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By forming a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—think: Barnes and Noble and Starbucks—you can bring your products or services in front of more customers in a mutually beneficial way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you run a carpentry business, you might decide to join forces with an electrician. Each of you could recommend the other as jobs pop up, and so forth. And, of course, you could work together on projects that required both skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other small business strategic partnerships could include a restaurant partnering with a local brewery to sell beer with their meals, a copywriting agency partnering with a graphic design studio for content marketing collaboration, and nursery partnering with a landscaping company to be the exclusive provider of plants, shrubs, and trees for every job.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to take your small business to the next level?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing a small business into a big one isn’t easy. But it’s not impossible either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By crafting a robust marketing strategy, investing in business development, and figuring out which growth strategy to pursue, you’ll be well on your way toward accomplishing your objectives and taking your company where you want it to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good luck!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Asian business woman using iPad to network with outsourced providers and partners." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the hardest-working entrepreneur can’t do everything on their own. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, every small business owner needs to hire a team if they want their companies to get to the next level. While some roles require dedicated personnel—such as start-up&#8217;s need for a handful of full-time developers in-house—other responsibilities are often better suited for contractors, agencies, and freelancers. This article explains the outsourcing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about outsourcing some of the tasks your team is dealing with on a regular basis, take comfort in the fact you’re not alone. In fact, one </span><a href="https://fortunly.com/statistics/outsourcing-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 54 percent of businesses work with third-party entities to achieve their objectives. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do companies choose to outsource work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, small businesses usually decide to outsource work for two reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, they might simply not have enough room in the budget to hire a full-time employee, guaranteeing their salary, covering their benefits, and taking care of payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, as every entrepreneur knows too well, there are never enough hours in the day. So, as operations start to scale, small business owners often decide to outsource certain tasks they’ve taken care of since the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an entrepreneur might decide to hire a payroll company for small businesses instead of taking care of accounting functions every quarter. As a result, there’s more time to spend on everything else.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of outsourcing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason more and more small business owners are working with contractors, freelancers, and third-party agencies: The benefits of outsourcing—which we’ll briefly explore next—are numerous.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. More time to focus on the bigger picture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As all business owners know too well, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2020/07/16/why-entrepreneurs-should-prioritize-time-management-within-their-businesses/?sh=2a036de29a8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">time is a limiting factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it might have been easy enough to write a couple blog posts, send out invoices, and handle other administrative responsibilities in the past, there comes a point when small business owners need to step away from these tasks and learn the power of delegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing work, small business owners are able to reclaim time each week they can then invest in other more important areas of operations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Hire experts to do specific tasks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you’re not taking care of something on your own any more doesn’t mean quality will suffer. In fact, the opposite is often true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue the above example, most small business owners aren’t experts in copywriting, accounting, and people ops. They’re experts in their business’ core functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing the right tasks to better-qualified parties, small business owners are usually able to ensure the resulting outcomes are more impactful than if they took care of the same things themselves.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Get the job done cost-effectively</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way around it: Hiring employees is expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are businesses responsible for payroll taxes and benefits, they also have to devote resources to sourcing and interviewing candidates. Once an employee is hired, the work is just beginning. Companies usually have to invest a lot of resources into </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/professional-services-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiring and training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other hidden costs to consider, too. For example, depending on how many employees you have, you might have to hire additional workers (e.g., managers and an HR professional). There are also costs associated with equipment, utilities, office space, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, outsourcing certain tasks lets you bypass this altogether. You end up getting to leverage someone else’s expertise without having to break the bank or absorb tons of indirect costs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Invest in other areas of growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re spending less money on payroll while outsourcing, there’s more budget to devote elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you run a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landscaping company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might decide to sponsor a local Little League team with your savings. If you run a restaurant, you might decide to put your savings from outsourcing toward </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying a food truck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening another location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you could always decide to put any excess funds aside and save them for a rainy day. As far too many small business owners learned the hard way in 2020, an emergency fund is more than just a nice to have.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Improve business continuity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of 2020, all business owners know how rapidly things can change. Everything can be going swimmingly one day, and then all of a sudden, an unforeseen event can rear its ugly head, derailing operations overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By joining forces with third parties, entrepreneurs can mitigate some of this risk while improving business continuity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, imagine a business headquartered in Colorado loses power during a massive blizzard. The business has partnered with a marketing agency in New York City and a freelance accountant in Austin, Texas. Even though their own doors may be closed, the marketing agency and accounting professional can keep plugging away, making sure work doesn’t grind to a halt entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you have a solid understanding about the benefits of outsourcing. That said, just because outsourcing can help you grow your business doesn’t mean you should outsource </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">task. Up next, we’ll explore some of the more common tasks small business owners try to route to other professionals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should small businesses outsource?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every small business is unique, there are still a number of threads that tie them all together. In most cases, here are some of the responsibilities that small business owners outsource most often:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Marketing. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of writing blogs or designing ebooks by yourself, consider enlisting the services of freelancers who can take care of these tasks for you. The right partners will be able to produce high-quality content reliably, freeing you to focus on other needs.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Web design. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still using a template-based, do-it-yourself website builder, it’s probably time to give your site a makeover. Enlist a talented agency to take care of this for you. That way, you’ll end up with an incredible digital property on the other side—and you won’t have to waste countless hours making tweak after tweak. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accounting. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There comes a time when every owner of a growing business needs to step away from processing invoices, paying bills and taxes, and making sure employees are paid on time. In the digital age when a solution only is a quick search away, one of the easiest tasks to outsource is accounting.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>HR. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you don’t have time to make sure every new hire has signed each form, enrolled in health insurance, and has gotten up to speed with every policy and procedure. Luckily, human resources for small business services are popping up every day. Again, a quick search will find the answers you’re looking for.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have an idea of the kinds of tasks your small business can outsource, let’s turn our attention to some of the things you should keep in mind before deciding to hire consultants, freelancers, and third-party agencies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you consider before outsourcing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While outsourcing can be incredibly helpful to many small businesses, you can’t just decide to outsource any old task and expect great results. Here are some of the questions to ask yourself as you whittle down your options.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Is this mission-critical or is this something I should delegate?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If something is absolutely critical to your operations, by all means keep that responsibility on your own plate. The last thing you want to do is to outsource a really important task to someone only to find out the hard way they made a costly mistake.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Is this the right move for the long term?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right approach, outsourcing can help you grow your business. That said, it’s important that you don’t sacrifice long-term potential for short-term gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you have a dedicated employee who’s looking to develop more skills, it may make more sense, in certain scenarios, to train that individual to level up instead of contracting a third-party’s services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, in an age where more and more workers expect jobs to be </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional development opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this could have a massive impact on employee retention and productivity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Can I afford to pay freelancers and contractors?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about outsourcing work and enlisting the services of freelancers, contractors, and third-party agencies, that’s awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just need to make sure you have the cash needed to pay them for their services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it: Every small business owner worries about cash flow—at least from time to time. While working with third parties can be the more cost-effective option in many cases, you still need to be able to settle up invoices if you want your outsourcing initiatives to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ideal world, you’ll always have cash on hand to pay contractors on time each and every time. But in the real world, you might run into a scenario where money’s tight and you need to turn to an outside source of financing to settle your bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to worry: By securing a flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the funds you need to pay your near-term debts are always at your fingertips.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What tasks are you going to outsource?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No entrepreneur can do it all by themselves. Truth be told, there comes a time in every small business owner’s life when outsourcing tasks is a necessity for taking the company to the next level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re reading these words, you’re on the precipice of witnessing the upside of outsourcing first hand. Form a plan, start small, take things piece by piece, and you’ll do just fine.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="A helicopter landing on a helipad delivering medical supplies" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to advances in medicine and technology, the population of elderly people in the United States continues to increase. While there were fewer than 50 million elderly Americans in 2015, it’s expected there will be 70 million of them by 2030, according to census data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth, coupled with the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act and the public’s need for medical care, has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to make some serious cash by building businesses that provide needed healthcare services. This is why more and more entrepreneurs are starting medical transportation companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In large part, these non-emergency transportation companies take elderly and disabled patients from their homes to routine appointments and checkups, then back again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who use non-emergency medical transportation companies are usually on stretchers, wheelchair-bound, or rely on walkers or canes to move from place to place. In almost all instances, these folks are simply unable to use traditional transportation services—like taxi cabs or buses—to get from Point A to Point B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they require some sort of assistance, they have two options when it comes to getting to their appointments: call an ambulance and spend a lot of money or use a non-emergency medical transportation company that’s much more affordable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many patients—or at least those in charge of managing their finances—choose the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about starting a medical transportation company, that’s great news. You’ve figured out that there’s an increasing need for this kind of service which appears likely to continue growing, with no signs of slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands now, the </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-american-healthcare-mobility-markets-report-2020-bourgeoning-nemt-market-is-expected-to-cross-15-billion-by-2027-due-to-tnc-entry-301218021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-emergency medical transportation sector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to generate $15 billion annually by 2027. How do you get the biggest slice of that pie?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I start a profitable senior transportation business?</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Make sure you have enough money</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you might be asking yourself this question: How much does it cost to start a medical transportation company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of the associated </span><a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/MedicalTransportationProviderApplicationInformation.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory start-up costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can take hundreds of thousands of dollars to start your own non-emergency medical transportation company. You need to register your business; cover legal, insurance, permit, and licensing fees; acquire a facility; purchase vehicles; pay utility bills and wage expenses; launch a website; and cover other costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you move forward any further, make sure you have enough money to launch the business. If not, you may have to sell some equity in your business to an investor, apply for a small business loan, or obtain a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Pick the right location</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because everyone needs healthcare services, you can also open a profitable business in practically any part of the country. That said, you still want to do your due diligence ahead of time to figure out whether it makes sense to open in specific markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if there are a lot of non-emergency medical transportation companies in a small city, you may want to open up shop somewhere that doesn’t have as much competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for locations that have dialysis centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other senior assisted-living facilities nearby. That’s where you’ll get most of your revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget that some students need non-emergency medical transportation, too. You may also be able to secure contracts through local school districts.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Take care of legal and insurance aspects</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’d be surprised at how many people forget to tackle the fine print when they’re launching a business. First things first: you may want to incorporate your medical transport company to start things off. Incorporating can ensure you won’t lose your personal assets in the event you get sued, and should be something you consider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also need to figure out which kind of driver’s license you need to take people from one location to another, which varies on a state-by-state basis. Additionally, you’ll need general liability insurance, car insurance, and worker’s compensation insurance in the event one of your employees is injured on the job.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Figure out how to market your business</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re all set up, it’s time to go out and land your first clients and start </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-5-step-blueprint-to-growing-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing your small business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do some research to find out how much your competitors charge their customers and price your services with that in mind. Next, you’ll want to send out some marketing information to prospective customers to let them know that you’re open for business. Offering  discounts is a great way to encourage people to give you a shot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also want to maintain an SEO-friendly blog that covers relevant industry trends and helpful tips your customers will appreciate. Use social media to promote those posts. That way, when people are looking for a company that offers your services, they’ll find you. You may also want to see if you can form partnerships with hospitals, nursing homes, and other similar facilities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Make sure you can collect payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business needs the ability to collect payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the non-emergency medical transportation industry, you will generally deal with two types of payments: those that come from the patients (or the people who manage their finances) and those that come from the government. In some instances, it may make sense for you to install a device that enables you to collect credit card payments in your vehicle, similar to what many taxis have. In other instances, it might not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid payments will most likely be a major portion of your total receipts. The laws vary from county to county, so make sure you’re familiar with the ones that affect your business before launching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the Medicaid patients, some clients will be able to pay bills by themselves either by writing checks or paying with cash on the spot. In other instances, you’ll have to bill their guardians, who are responsible for managing their finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that you may have to wait a while before collecting the second type of payments. If you run into cash flow problems while waiting for checks to come in, you can use an invoice financing service like Fundbox to advance payments on outstanding invoices.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Hire employees as your business grows</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more patients and land bigger contracts, you’ll need to hire enough drivers, coordinators, and support staff to handle the higher volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure your patients get the quality of service they’re looking for, do your best to hire the best and brightest experienced workers you can find. Assuming you’re the CEO, you’ll need to hire drivers and an office manager. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how big your company gets, you may also need to hire a dedicated marketing team, a finance department, and a human resources manager.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Stay on top of changing laws</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of this writing, the ACA is the law of the land. To ensure your company never runs afoul of the law, it is imperative that you stay informed about any new regulations coming down the pike that may affect your business. You will also want to stay abreast of potential changes to tax laws that impact your company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to start your medical transportation company?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other business, starting a medical transportation company is hard work. As long as you know that from the outset and are willing to put in the time and energy necessary to succeed, your business is off to a great start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can starting a medical transportation company generate a lot of revenue and create a lot of jobs, you’ll also be providing a critical service to a number of elderly and disabled patients—helping them and their loved ones enjoy a better quality of life. In many ways, it’s the best of both worlds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether they have money on hand or need to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-a-convertible-note/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover the expenditure, most organizations go through a process called capital budgeting to determine whether the investment is worthwhile.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is capital budgeting? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital budgeting is the process in which organizations evaluate several different high-cost opportunities to see which one will deliver the most value to shareholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a company considering building a new manufacturing plant would conduct a capital budgeting exercise to weigh the costs that would go into the project, the timeline, the impact the project might have on cash flow, and what the return is projected to look like on the other side (i.e., how much cash it’s supposed to bring in).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on this information, the organization can prioritize projects accordingly and choose which ones to move forward with and which to kick to the back burner.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the five methods of capital budgeting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every capital project is the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can’t make an apples-to-apples comparison between buying a new fleet of industrial equipment and investing in a best-in-class training program for your entire team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make it easier to figure out which projects are worth prioritizing, many organizations use a combination of these five capital budgeting methods. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Net present value (NPV)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPV represents the difference between cash inflows and outflows over a specific period of time. When a project has a positive NPV, it signifies that the project will bring in more revenue than you’ll have to pay out to complete it. Generally speaking, projects with negative NPV should be avoided at all costs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Internal rate of return (IRR)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRR refers to how much an investment is expected to grow over a one-year period. This figure is determined using the same equation as NPV, except the NPV value is zero. This method is helpful for comparing expected annual returns of different projects over 12 months.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Profitability index</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profitability index is a simple equation where you divide the present value of expected future cash flows by the associated capital expenditure. If, for example, future cash flows are $500,000 and your project costs $300,000, its profitability index rating would be 1.67. As a rule of thumb, when a project has a profitability index over 1, it will likely be a worthwhile investment.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Accounting rate of return (ARR)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARR is another capital budgeting accounting method that compares a project’s expected average revenue to how much money the organization invested to make it all happen. Unlike other capital budgeting methods, ARR does not consider cash flow or the time value of money. Still, the metric can be helpful in determining how much revenue you can expect to generate across a number of projects.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Payback period</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payback period metric tells you how long it will take to break even on a capital project. Like the ARR, the payback period doesn’t consider the time value of money either. If, for example, a company is considering investing $6 million in a new project that is supposed to return $2 million a year, the payback period would be three years. At the same time, they’re also considering another $6 million project that is supposed to return $1 million a year. In this scenario, the company might decide to go with the first project because they can start making money faster.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pros and cons of capital budgeting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it: Capital projects are massive undertakings. Make the right decision, and great things can happen. Make the wrong one, and disaster might be lurking right around the corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of capital budgeting to help you figure out whether it makes sense for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps you compare different kinds of projects along the same metrics to make the best decisions based on data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gives you a number of different techniques to use to make wise investments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enables you to deliver more value to stakeholders by increasing the chances you make the best decisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can give you false security because you are dealing with hypotheticals; if a project gets delayed or runs over budget, what good are your calculations?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you make a decision, the implications can be significant; the wrong decision could seriously hurt your organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding skilled accountants with bandwidth to make these calculations can be a tall order—and a pricey endeavor</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is capital budgeting right for you?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, capital budgeting can be a particularly helpful mechanism for deciding which capital projects to pursue—and which to put on pause. That said, your capital budgeting calculations are theoretical and not set in stone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you should certainly use capital budgeting to help determine your next moves, you should also be wary to treat these numbers like gospel. If there’s one thing we’ve learned over the last year, the world can change rapidly overnight, and anything can happen at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By doing your due diligence and crunching the numbers before moving forward with your next capital project, you can improve the chances your company makes the right moves. And when it boils down to it, that’s the best you and any stakeholders can hope for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s to prioritizing the most profitable capital projects!</span></p>

The unofficial holiday reminds us to celebrate our blessings by going out of our way to do good deeds unexpectedly to both strangers and the people we already know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you might’ve never given too much thought about how your company could benefit from Random Acts of Kindness Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it turns out that a few small acts of kindness—on the holiday or really on any other day, for that matter—can have a profoundly positive impact on your team, your customers, and your community.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a small act of kindness?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the name suggests, a small act of kindness is a minor gesture you do to put a smile on someone’s face or make them feel happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not talking about giving a random person $100,000 or anything like that. Think more along the lines of helping an older person cross the street, holding the coffee shop door open for the person who’s pushing a stroller behind you, or complimenting your waiter for going above and beyond and being exceptional at their job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many small acts of kindness you can do that don’t cost a penny, you might also want to leave that great waiter a large tip or pay to fill up a random person’s gas tank.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do small acts of kindness impact others?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of simply being a nice thing to do, exuding kindness can have a profoundly positive impact on our personal and professional lives.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It improves our health</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/how-sharing-kindness-can-make-you-healthier-happier/art-20390060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayo Clinic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, being kind to other people makes us happier and reduces our own pain and tension. It might even slow down the aging process, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our minds are cluttered with negative emotions, it’s harder for us to think clearly and make the best decisions. Being kind helps us function at a </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dont-forget-the-basil/201806/being-kind-others-benefits-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher psychological level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which enables us to figure out the best way forward in any situation instead of making rash decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, studies have shown that being kind can be more impactful on the giver than the recipient. So, next time you feel like going out of your way to do something nice, don’t hesitate to do it even for selfish reasons.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes other people feel generous</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kindness is contagious. In fact, </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/making-kindness-a-core-tenet-of-your-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that when folks perceive others as being kind to them, they are more likely to return the favor and be kind to other people, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, not only will you feel healthier by being kind to other people—you will improve </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">well-being, too. Instead of being an irate boss adding to their stress, your kindness has the opposite effect, and that effect can ripple across your entire small business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, all of your employees become kinder overnight, which improves your company culture and impresses every customer that interacts with your team.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes you more persuasive as a leader</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you’re tasked with getting your team to see your vision and trust you enough to follow you on the journey.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/connect-then-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kindness helps here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, too. When you are warm and friendly with your team, you’re more likely to build rapport and camaraderie—making it that much easier for you to convince your team to follow your lead.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some random acts of kindness I can do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to be kind this National Random Acts of Kindness Day, here are three ideas to get you thinking in the right direction.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Write your employees handwritten thank-you notes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees are the lifeblood of your small business. How often do you sing their praises for hitting it out of the park day in and day out? In the digital age, a handwritten note is something that makes us stop and think. Spending some time writing brief letters to everyone on your team to convey what they mean to you and your business can go a long way toward bringing some brightness to their lives—brightness that can persist for months and even years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Be more flexible with collecting client payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every company has deep pockets. So, why not help the less fortunate? For example, you might decide to secure a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/fundbox-podcast-chocolatier-pivots-during-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would enable you to give your cash-strapped clients a few extra weeks to pay their bills. This is exactly what Strider, an online marketing and SEO agency, did to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helping-underserved-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help underserved clients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest in marketing without losing sleep over an invoice they needed to pay.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Volunteer to help your local community</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great way to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day is by enlisting your team to volunteer their time to help support a local cause. For example, you might decide to clean up a park, cook meals for the less fortunate, or have a bake sale and donate the proceeds to a local nonprofit. As an added bonus, such activities double as team-building exercises, which can help you cultivate a stronger team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, there are an infinite number of ways to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day. No matter what you decide to do, just remember that there’s no rule preventing you from being kind day in and day out.</span></p>

That’s great news! Starting a painting business can be a very rewarding venture. But before you pick up your paintbrush and dive straight into painting the best houses on the block, let’s look at what it actually takes to start a painting business. From creating a solid business plan to getting the right team on your side, there are a lot of important steps to take before officially opening your painting business. Let’s dive in!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is starting a painting business a good idea?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be! If you have the skillset to get the job done right, offer good customer service, and are strategic, then starting a painting business can be a great investment in your future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, opening a painting business doesn’t have too many overhead costs and isn’t too expensive. Starting a painting business shouldn’t cost more than $2,000 to get going. While that is a lot of money, startup costs can be much higher for other types of businesses. Because your startup costs won’t be too high, you will be able to turn a profit fairly quickly once you book your first job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you live can play a big factor in how lucrative your painting business can be. If you live in an area with high housing prices and with residents that have extra money to invest in home repairs, then you shouldn’t have any trouble finding work at fair rates. Homeowners associations often encourage and may even require homeowners to refresh the paint on the outside of their homes every few years. This means that if you keep your customers happy, they may keep coming back to you whenever they need a touch up. Drumming up new business is half the challenge, so if you can secure repeat customers, you’ll be off to a great start. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do paint company owners make?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you’ll make owning your own house painting business will depend a lot on how you choose to run your business. There’s no one clear answer to the question of “how much do paint company owners make”, so consider asking yourself a few questions that will allow you to gauge your unique income potential. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you do all of the work yourself or will you hire workers to pick up some of the slack? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many jobs do you plan to take on? Will you be able to invest in advertising? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the demand like in your area?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do other house painters in your community charge?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve decided you want to move ahead and start your own painting business, there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started with Your House Painting Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for the best way to start a business, getting organized is a great place to start. Let’s look at some must-have steps you need to take to learn how to start a painting business.</span></p>
<h3>Create a business plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you dive into starting a painting business, you need to sit down and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a solid business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can act as a roadmap to success. Having a well-thought out painting business plan can provide clarity and focus, while keeping you super organized. Every good business plan should contain:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Executive summary</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Company description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Market analysis</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Description of offerings and value propositions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marketing and sales strategy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Financial plan and profit potential</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Short-term and long-term business goals</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Appendix </span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Make it legal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve written a robust business plan, it’s time to make things official. You’ll want to make sure your entire business is run above board, so confer with your accountant for advice, which may require you to take the following steps to legitimacy:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Register your company with your local and state government. Unlike corporations, LLCs or some other legal entities, sole proprietors and independent contractors do not have to register with your state’s office of Secretary of State. However, some states require you to register your business name, such as a fictitious or assumed business name, with your county clerk, registrar or recorder.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply for an EIN. This is your business’s “social security number” and is necessary to file taxes and hire employees. If you’re a sole proprietorship, you don’t have to have an EIN, but you may find you want one. For example, you can use your EIN instead of your social security number as your taxpayer identification number, which can give you some much needed peace of mind if you work with a lot of clients that require you to provide one for tax purposes. Your accountant can point you in the right direction. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply for any business licenses or forms of insurance you’ll need to operate your business legitimately and safely. These needs will vary on a state and more local level, so make sure you check in with your local chamber of commerce if you need help understanding what you have to register for. If you’re hiring workers, having workers compensation insurance will be a must.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Find Funding</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can afford to self-fund your new painting business, then you can skip ahead to the next section. But if you need a little help in the financing department (which many people do), then you may want to consider taking out a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover your startup costs. Buying supplies, purchasing insurance, paying for advertisements, and hiring staff can all get pricey. Don’t be afraid to look into your financing options to get the ball rolling. </span></p>
<h3>Hire staff or contract workers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not expecting to paint entire houses on your own, are you? Once you’ve got your business set up, it’s time to figure out whether you want to hire employees or use subcontractors instead. If you choose the former option, you’ll have to buy equipment and supplies for your own workers to use—but you’ll retain control over your business. If you choose to </span><a href="http://paintingbusinesspro.com/how-to-sub-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use subcontractors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who are essentially professional freelance painters, you won’t have to buy materials—but you’ll lose some control over your business.</span></p>
<h3>Find the right supplies</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve decided how you’re going to staff your business, it’s time to stock up on supplies. You’ll need brushes, rollers, painter’s tape, ladders, sanders, caulking tools, rags, cloths to avoid drips and </span><a href="http://www.sherwin-williams.com/home-builders/products/catalog/categories/equipment-supplies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll obviously need to buy paint too.</span></p>
<h3>Market your services</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have everything you need to start painting houses, so start marketing your business. Set up a Facebook page, talk to your friends and family members to see whether anyone they know needs work, and put up fliers around town advertising your business. Once a customer bites, you’ll have to </span><a href="http://paintingbusinesspro.com/how-to-estimate-exterior-paint-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide an estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the work they need. Formalize an agreement, repeat the process and see how many houses you can paint.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash Flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s more to it than just painting houses. For example, like any other small business owner, those who own house painting companies aren’t immune from cash flow problems. When the cash river of a painting business runs dry, you’re unable to buy supplies, market your business and pay contractors and employees. You may have a hard time making insurance and tax payments too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow problems can materialize for a number of reasons, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs may take longer than expected. A job you think can be completed in five days might take eight days. This pushes back your other jobs, delaying those payments, too.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers might not pay on time. Though in a perfect world, they’d pay you right away, it might be weeks or even months before customers settle their bills.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment and supplies may be lost or damaged. A bunch of paint could get ruined or you could lose a box of brushes and other equipment, forcing you to repurchase supplies you hadn’t budgeted for.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accident could occur. One of your employees could accidentally break a window at a customer’s house, causing you to incur unforeseen expenses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government regulations may hit your bottom line. There’s a lot of talk these days about raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. Maybe your business plan is built on the fact you can pay college kids $12/hour to paint for you during the summer. Should the minimum wage rise to $15/hour, you could be in a jam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that you aren’t completely powerless over your cash flow situation. In fact, by taking advantage of new financial tools, you’re able to solve your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/pay-small-businesses-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—before they start.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conquering Cash Flow and Growing Your House Painting Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of spending your time waiting for customers to pay their bills, you can use an </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the money you need to grow your business—and fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you connect your accounting software to Fundbox, your business can be evaluated based on the data in your accounting software. If approved for credit, you can choose which invoices you want to clear (up to your credit limit). Fundbox can then transfer that amount into your account as soon as one business day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You then have 12 or 24 weeks to repay,plus a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most parts of the country, house painters have a short window to operate in: the summer! Given that, there’s no sense in waiting around for checks to come in before you can move on to the next project. Thanks to Fundbox, you might not have to.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_212991547-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Businessman in vest and tie uses hands to mime binoculars, as if looking intently to the future." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_212991547-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shutterstock_212991547.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beginning of a new year is as good a time as any to take a step back and figure out what you can do to get your small business’ financial house in order. Due to the uncertainties that came with 2020, this maxim holds even more truth for 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin to make financial resolutions for the new year, it’s important to strike a balance between short-term and long-term financial goals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is an example of a short-term financial goal?</span></h2>
<p>Like the name suggests, a short-term financial goal is something you hope to achieve in the near future — say within six or 12 months tops.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you’re one of the </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-companies-can-survive-without-bringing-in-money-2020-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 percent of businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that only has a cash buffer that allows you to keep your doors open for 27 days, </span>you may want to establish an immediate short-term goal of increasing your cash reserves.</p>
<p>That way, you’d be better positioned to deal with some of the unforeseen disruptions many small businesses saw in 2020.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you set long-term financial goals?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term financial goals, on the other hand, are goals you hope to achieve at some point down the road—in five, 10, or 20 years, or even longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common long-term financial goals for small business owners is making sure you have enough money to retire comfortably. Unfortunately, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/14/heres-how-many-americans-are-not-saving-any-money-for-emergencies-or-retirement-at-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21 percent of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t put </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of their income aside for retirement planning, and </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/survey-finds-42-americans-retire-100701878.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">64 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lack the funds they need to live comfortably in their golden years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you have more retirement options than the average professional. To this end, you might want to look into establishing an </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEP IRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a solo 401(k) program in 2021 to meet your long-term financial goal of retiring comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that—by making financial resolutions and sticking to them—it’s possible to achieve both your short-term and long-term financial goals. It might take some time and some sacrifice. But with patience and determination, it’s possible to optimize your small business’ cash situation and end up in a much stronger financial position before you know it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin planning for 2021, one thing to keep in mind is that—while financial resolutions are great to make— they’re also okay to break; lots of people tend to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2018/12/31/goals-not-resolutions/?sh=604182093879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">break their resolutions anyway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, simply spending the time coming up with resolutions is a worthwhile exercise that can start getting you thinking in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this in mind, let’s take a look at four financial resolutions you should consider for your small business as we move into the new year. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Review and optimize your monthly budget </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, </span><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/11/small-business-budget-statistics.html#:~:text=A%20new%20survey%20from%20Clutch,official%20documented%20budget%20for%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">61 percent of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have any sort of documented budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re a one-person team and have good control over your finances, that might not matter much. But once your small business starts to scale, you should seriously consider setting a budget and tracking cash outflows each month. Not only will this give you more visibility into where your finances stand at any given time, it will also improve your cash flow and can help you identify areas where you could potentially find some savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t improve your business’ spending habits if you don’t know what they are to begin with. By reviewing your spending each month, you can identify areas for optimization, get more control over your finances in a relatively short period of time, and measure your progress.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Pay down high-interest credit card debt</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s such a thing as “good debt,” high-interest business credit card debt definitely isn’t it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet according to a </span><a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/what-percent-of-smbs-carry-consistent-credit-card-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly one out of every four small businesses carry a balance on their credit card each month. What’s more, 50 percent say they carry a balance every now and again. If you’re contributing to either of those figures, you should do whatever it takes to settle your balance in full as fast as you can. Otherwise, you’re just burning money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are credit card interest rates prohibitively high, you end up paying interest on interest when you only make minimum payments each month. Depending on how high your balance is, it can lead to a debt spiral that’s incredibly hard to get out of in the best case scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve paid off your business credit card debt, get into the habit of paying your balance off in full </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">each month</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Use credit cards for convenience and to take advantage of rewards points—not to dig yourself into a massive hole of debt.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Secure flexible financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a small business owner whose goal is ending up next year in a much healthier financial position, you should think about securing a flexible source of financing that gives you fast access to the cash you need to grow. It beats the alternative of racking up high-interest debt or running into cash flow problems and not knowing what to do next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply</a> for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> online and borrow against it as needed, only paying interest on the money you draw. Remember, getting a business line of credit doesn’t always require a long application process. Learn </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/#how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to apply for a Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two easy steps and, if approved, secure funding rapidly. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Invest in your future</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a resolution that combines short-term and long-term financial goals: investing more money in the future of your company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short-term goal could be investing in new tools and technologies that enable you to increase productivity. For example, if you’re still using spreadsheets or worse to manage your accounting, you might want to check out accounting solutions like Quickbooks, FreshBooks, or Xero. Not only will this give you more control over your finances, you’ll also be able to reclaim time and reinvest it in other areas of operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, you may find that a simple investment like this gives you enough time to develop new products, target new customers, or create more persuasive marketing campaigns — all of which can help grow your bottom line.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your financial resolutions for 2021?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">some financial resolutions and sticking to them, it’s that much easier for your small business to finish up next year in a more advantageous position than you began it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above list is by no means complete; there are hundreds upon hundreds of financial resolutions you can make for the upcoming year. Still, it should give you some ideas as a starting point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s to making smart financial resolutions that enable you to help your business achieve its goals next year and beyond.</span></p>
