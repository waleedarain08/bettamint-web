You feel pulled in many different directions, unable to focus on any one thing at a time. You’re anxious and bogged down with stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are you going to get through this while getting things done well and on time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in learning more about handling stress effectively, you’ve come to the right place. This article provides several methods for dealing with stress—and tips on handling stress when you’re working from home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Make a short list</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in handling stress at work is to put away the massive to-do list and focus on what is most important. If you’re wondering how to relieve stress, you may find the answer you’re looking for by simply trying to focus on fewer tasks at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try making your own list of three priorities, then focus only on the top item on your list until it’s completed. If your high-priority items are too complex to complete in a day, then you probably need to break them down further into more manageable bite-size tasks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Call in reinforcements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelming moments are the perfect time to lean on your support network. You may have a partner or team member who can take some work off of your plate, reducing the number of potential stressors in your day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For you, the best reinforcements might come in the form of people who can take on some of your non-work responsibilities (e.g., childcare, cleaning, and running errands). That way, you can focus on your work. In other cases, it might be telling your boss you need a mental health day and asking them to reassign work accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the key is to ask for help when you need it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Take a breather</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When things get especially tense—like when you’re putting the final touches on a presentation you have to give next week—sometimes the best thing you can do is walk away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best stress management techniques is simply giving yourself a 30-minute break (or longer, if needed) to reset your psyche and get yourself centered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A break can do wonders for perspective, too. Maybe you’re getting stressed out about things that aren’t all that important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a deep breath, relax, and when the time comes, you’ll be able to deliver a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-deliver-stress-free-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress-free presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lives up to the high bar you set for yourself.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Turn up the music</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/jobs/how-music-can-improve-worker-productivity-workstation.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music can boost productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so pick some of your favorite tunes to play in the background while you focus on your three high-priority items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your line of work, you may find that the louder the music, the more motivated you become. The “psyching up” period usually happens in just a song or two, so you don’t need to necessarily blast the tunes all day long (thankfully!).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Say ‘no’ to potential new stress sources</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your stress is stemming from simply having too much to do, it may be time to start saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as you may want to do everything and be there for everyone, it’s not always realistic. When you reach the critical point when something has to give, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2020/10/21/how-to-say-no-to-at-work/?sh=5243e8e04b19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Go for a run</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good sweat can be the perfect way to reset your mood and get yourself motivated to work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try going for a run, or a walk, or to the gym—anything that gets your blood flowing and forces you to break a sweat. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, you can burn off some of the anxiety and come back to work calmer and more focused.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Wait until tomorrow</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all else fails, the answer may be in just leaving it all until tomorrow. This is especially true if you’re </span><a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/development/tp/avoid-burnout-in-your-small-business.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tired and burnt out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you reach that point, sleep can help solve the problem. Get a good night’s sleep and come back to your list in the morning when you’re fresh and ready to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you recognize the signs of overwhelming stress approaching, any of these tips should help you rein it in and take back control. As you discover more tricks that work for you, create an emergency checklist to keep on your desk so you know exactly what to do next.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handling stress when working from home</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work has always been a major stressor for many of us. But the pandemic compounded this reality even further. As more and more people found themselves forced to work from home for months on end — in many cases stuck with their children, too—</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/03/the-stress-of-working-from-home-is-getting-to-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work became even more stressful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for many professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn some tips and tricks about what you can do to manage stress effectively when you find yourself stuck at home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does working from home reduce stress?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, research suggested that working from home could actually be a </span><a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/the-benefits-of-working-from-home#:~:text=A%202011%20study%20from%20Staples,as%20well%20as%20eat%20healthier." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress reliever</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, there’s a massive difference between working from home when your kids and spouse are elsewhere and working from home when everyone’s packed in your house like sardines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, handling stress in remote environments is possible with the right approach—whether you’re stuck with your family or not (more on this in a bit).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the challenges of working from home?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home isn’t all roses — even for the employees who vastly prefer it to working in the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, not everyone is a self-motivated individual. When you’re working from home, you might struggle to manage your schedule and your time effectively. On top of that, some remote workers have a hard time separating their personal and professional lives. They might find themselves sitting on the couch at 10 p.m. watching a movie while thumbing through their inbox and replying to work emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, working from home gives employees access to an endless number of distractions. Do I really need to take care of this project right now or can I play my guitar for 20 minutes instead? Because they’re stuck at home and miss out on the social aspect of the office, some remote employees also suffer from social isolation. too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you handle stress when working from home?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that it’s possible to manage stress effectively while working from home. In fact, studies have found that </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15259-working-from-home-more-productive.html#:~:text=Working%20From%20Home%20Increases%20Productivity&amp;text=According%20to%20one%20study%2C%20remote,weeks%20of%20work%20per%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote workers can be more productive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their in-office counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may very well be able to mimic those results. You just need the right approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re stressed out working from home, some tips to consider are creating a dedicated workspace that’s conducive to your productivity, establishing a morning routine, and investing in tools that can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fleet-management-business-savings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">save your business time and stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you should also be cognizant of the fact your colleagues or employees may be struggling while working at home. To this end, make sure your business invests in communication and collaboration tools that make it easy for your team to stay connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers may also want to think outside the box and host virtual team-building events on a platform like Zoom. For example, you might hire a chef to teach the team how to cook a meal, with everyone trying to recreate the same meal in their own kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, stress is an unavoidable part of work—whether you’re in an office, at your house, or working somewhere else entirely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By mastering the art of handling stress and knowing how to defuse stress when it invariably rears its ugly head, you can stay productive in any working environment—much to the delight of your team, your customers, and your bottom line.</span></p>

There are a lot of things that can go wrong, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you are destined for failure if you want to make the move into business ownership. If you have a solid business idea that you have thoroughly researched and <a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/business-ideas/a/how-to-qualify-a-business-idea.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evaluated</a>, then the risks should drop significantly.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoid These 4 Small Business Mistakes</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Jumping in Without a Plan</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Business plans are a must-have when starting a small business. However, it&#8217;s important to note that business plans can take different forms. A traditional business plan is generally long, takes extensive research to complete and is necessary in some situations—if you will be applying for a loan or a grant or if you will be pitching your ideas to an investor or potential business partner. If that isn&#8217;t the case for you, you can still benefit from creating a <a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/businessplans/ht/how-to-write-a-simple-business-plan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple business plan</a> because it can help guide your business activities on an ongoing basis, transforming into an action plan that helps you identify and achieve your goals.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Leaving Your Finances to Someone Else</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While it&#8217;s a good idea to have professionals on hand to take care of the parts of your business where you may have little experience, it&#8217;s also a good idea stay in the loop during this process. This is especially true when it comes to your business finances. You may decide that hiring an accountant and/or a bookkeeper makes sense, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should be hands-off. You need to have a handle on your finances and daily cash flow so you can make smart and realistic decisions in your small business.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Starting to Promote Too Soon</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many new business owners are so anxious to start making money that the first step of the launch they focus on is marketing the business. While marketing is integral to the success of your business, you need to make sure you have developed your brand before you create social media accounts, put up a website, or even get business cards printed. If you don&#8217;t have a clear understanding of what your business is about, who you&#8217;re trying to sell to, and how you will target them, your brand probably doesn&#8217;t have much staying power.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Overspending (and Underspending)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some aspiring business owners struggle with figuring how much investment it will take to get the business off the ground. Many either spend way too much on the early stages of the business because they feel like they need top-of-the-line everything to be successful. Others are way too stingy, cutting the wrong corners and costing themselves more in the long run. The goal is to have a solid understanding of the startup costs and ongoing expenses as well as a realistic view of profit potential, then use that information to create a working budget.</p>
<p>The key to being successful when starting a business is taking the time to go through each stage of the startup process. You should also be willing to call in reinforcements when you need them, so creating a support net of family, friends, mentors, and other entrepreneurs is always a great tactic.</p>

Some entrepreneurs have received formal education through undergraduate and graduate school; some have entered business ownership without any related education at all, gathering experience in the trenches. Despite the common cultural perception that academia tends to be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jmaureenhenderson/2013/08/13/why-small-business-owners-eschew-college-education/#2b754d385828" target="_blank">out-of-step with entrepreneurial innovation</a>, there really isn&#8217;t a right or wrong path. Instead it&#8217;s a matter of what is best for your individual situation.</p>
<p>For those entrepreneurs who have chosen the formal education route, why are they doing it, and would going back to school help you to further your own business prospects? Consider these four common reasons entrepreneurs go back to school as you make your decision about what level of education best fits your entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>
<h2><strong>4 Reasons Why Entrepreneurs Should Go Back to School</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Staying Current with Industry Changes<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Business administration, marketing, and other entrepreneurial education programs must stay on top of the latest technology and industry-related happenings in order to provide a successful and well-rounded program. This is why enrolling in a program at an accredited educational institution can help you stay current with news and trends. Most quality programs include hands-on exercises and programs that can help you experience industry landscape changes firsthand, making the knowledge immediately transferable to your business.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Adding a New Dimension to Your Experience<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Most entrepreneurs have skills in a wide range of areas because they are often accustomed to wearing many hats and taking care of business tasks on their own. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you won&#8217;t have gaps in your knowledge and experience, though. Going back to school allows you to fill any voids in knowledge, experience, and skills that may be holding you back from reaching your goals.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Providing a Chance to Pivot in Your Career<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The more you know, the more options you will have available to you; this is true in any type of career. As an entrepreneur, having a broad range of skills and experience can give you an &#8220;in&#8221; when you&#8217;re looking to enter a new market, can help you successfully pitch ideas to partners and investors, and can even give you the option to change paths entirely if you ever decide to close your doors and go back to working for someone else.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Accessing New Networking Opportunities<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Furthering your education can also further your list of connections, and having a large contact list is invaluable for entrepreneurs. Networking with classmates, professors, university staff, guest speakers, and others involved in the program can provide out-of-class learning opportunities that opens up the possibility for future partnerships and collaboration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that going back to school doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean enrolling in a two- to four-year higher education program. You can get some of the same value from participating in more targeted online courses from sites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, enrolling in a one-off course in a relevant area being offered at a local university, or taking a courses provided by the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/sba-learning-center/search/training/all" target="_blank">Small Business Administration</a>.</p>

An event planning business has the potential to make money fairly quickly with very little overhead cost. Here&#8217;s a look at what it takes to start an event planning business, including tips for a fast launch and getting to profitability quickly.</p>
<p>Event planning can be a year-round business, but with so many things to celebrate during the summer months (graduations, Memorial Day, Labor Day, 4th of July, weddings, and more), it&#8217;s an especially good business to start in the summer—and for many more reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can start the business on a part-time basis, even while working another job</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need training or certification to start the business</li>
<li>You can grow the business through word of mouth marketing, giving potential clients a taste of what you provide at every party you plan</li>
<li>There are virtually no start-up costs (other than marketing)</li>
<li>You can build on relationships with other key party service providers, such as DJs, entertainers, bakeries, and party rental services</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to start an event planning business to take advantage of the remaining summer months, the last thing you want is to get bogged down in an endless start-up loop that prevents the business from launching. Here is a quick list of tasks to get your business up and running very quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Research the Local Event Planning Competition<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is explore who else in your local area is offering event planning services. How are they reaching customers? What do they do well, and not so well? What areas are lacking that you can maximize?</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Create a Streamlined Plan<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to create a comprehensive business plan, but jot down some of the basics: What is your timeline, how much do you expect to make, what are your anticipated expenses, who is your target audience, what makes your business better than the competition.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Contact Local Complementary Businesses<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The quickest way to get your business out there is by teaming up. Reach out to other businesses that offer party-related services and create referral programs or package deals that streamline the process for customers.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Start Word of Mouth Right Away<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>The best way to promote a local business quickly and cost-effectively is by word of mouth marketing. The more people who know about your business, the more likely you are to receive referrals, so don&#8217;t wait to start spreading the word.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Collect Testimonials<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Once you begin working with clients, make it a habit to strive to make every client thrilled with your service, then ask each one to provide you with a testimonial. The more customers you have singing your praises, the faster your business will grow. This is especially true with online review sites, so encourage your clients to leave their testimonials on Facebook, Yelp, and others.</li>
</ol>
<p>An event planning business is a great business for organized, fun-loving, and creative personalities. If this sounds like you, there is still time to make some extra money as an event planner this summer, so get started today.</p>

However, there are ways even non-retail businesses can take advantage of the back-to-school buzz. With the buzz starting in August, this season can last up to two months, giving businesses all kinds of opportunities to offer something special and different to customers. Here are some ways to leverage back-to-school promotions in your small business.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Target the Audience That Fits Best<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>You may think about students when you think &#8220;back-to-school,&#8221; but this marketing opportunity isn&#8217;t just about the kids. In addition to young and college-age students, there are many other audiences that you can target with a back-to-school campaign—adult students, parents, teachers, childcare providers, and bus drivers, to name a few. Consider what audience fits your ideal clientele best and tailor your campaigns directly to them.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Run a Social Back-to-School Contest<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Social promotions are a great fit for this season because they are quick to implement at a very low cost. Determine which social platform is the best fit for your campaign, then build a plan around it. Some ideas include asking your customers to post their favorite back-to-school picture on Facebook or Pinterest, or picking a custom hashtag and starting a retweet campaign on Twitter, asking your customers to finish this sentence: &#8220;I love back-to-school season because&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Offer Coupons and Specials<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, coupons, discounts, and special offers still work! The key is finding a unique position that resonates with your audience and makes sense for your business. For example, a local restaurant could offer discounted kid&#8217;s meals or a coupon for mom and dad&#8217;s dinner out. A hair salon can provide $5 haircuts for kids, and a house cleaning service can provide a &#8220;kids are back at school&#8221; discount for any new cleanings scheduled in September. A buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offer can also be very powerful in the back-to-school context.</li>
<li>
<h2><strong>Kick Off a Loyalty Program<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>If you have the type of business that rewards repeat customers, consider using this season to launch a loyalty program that tracks purchases and offers a discount or freebie every 7 or 10 purchases. Essentially, this type of program rewards customers the more they purchase, so it can be used in different ways by different types of businesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to make a back-to-school campaign work for your business, make sure you create a campaign map and start early enough in the season to reach as much of your audience as possible. Remember that campaigns like this are not &#8220;one use-only.&#8221; You can reuse your back-to-school framework every year with a few new tactics or offers. This saves on both the financial cost and the time investment while allowing you to build on what worked year after year.</p>

If this sounds familiar and you can&#8217;t take time off from work in the form of a &#8220;real&#8221; vacation this summer, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck at your desk. You can take your work with you by creating a mobile office. Follow these tips to get started.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Pick the Best Device</strong></h2>
<p>The first step is to think about the type of work you&#8217;ll be doing so you can determine what type of device is best suited for your needs. Will you need to access files remotely? Will you need specific software and apps? Do you need to conduct meetings while you&#8217;re away? Think through your work process and make a list of the technology needed to accomplish it. Keep in mind that while you may be able to conduct some business from your smartphone, you&#8217;ll most likely need a laptop or at least a tablet to create a fully functional mobile office.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Get a Secure Internet Connection</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to an Internet connection while working on the go, your initial thought may be that this won&#8217;t be a problem because there are so many free WiFi hotspots out there. This could be problematic. Free <a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/tips-to-stay-safe-on-public-wi-fi/" target="_blank">WiFi often isn&#8217;t secure</a>, and if you use these connections while working, you are opening up a whole host of security problems. Instead, opt for setting up a personal hotspot with your smartphone, using a device that comes with its own secure data plan, or use a MiFi—a separate wireless router that acts as a private hotspot you can use to tether your computer for Internet access.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Leverage the Cloud</strong></h2>
<p>The cloud allows you access files and data from anywhere you are, provided you have an Internet connection. This eliminates the need to save data to an external device or email yourself all the files you think you&#8217;ll need access to while you&#8217;re away (which runs the risk of forgetting something). Using a cloud-based backup service will not only give you secure access to all of your files, but it will also automatically back up your data from every device you work on, allowing collaboration while preventing version control issues.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Create a Mobile Office &#8220;Go Pack&#8221;</strong></h2>
<p>To create a functional mobile office, you may need more than just an Internet-connected device. It&#8217;s important to have all of this equipment packed up and ready to go so you can take off when the opportunity presents itself. Take note of all of the equipment you use every day and make a list of what you would need to duplicate your setup remotely. This may mean you need a portable scanner or printer, a USB drive, a wireless mouse, a surge protector, and specific software and applications (make sure your apps are all updated before you leave!). It&#8217;s also a good idea to have a backup battery and a power cord with you so you can stay connected.</p>
<p>Once you have your mobile office ready to go, you&#8217;ll be able to get out of the office on a regular basis, giving yourself a new working environment and a fresh perspective whenever you need it.</p>

The <a href="https://www.landscapeprofessionals.org/nalp/media/landscape-industry-statistics.aspx" target="_blank">landscape services industry</a> has annual revenues of $76 billion and annual growth of 3.4%, making landscaping a solid business idea for many entrepreneurs. A whopping 65% of landscape businesses focus on residential services, including maintenance, landscape design, and snow removal, creating many different service options for getting started. The key to being successful in landscaping is making sure you don&#8217;t make these common mistakes.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Don&#8217;t Skip the Business Plan</strong></h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re serious about being successful, you need a business plan. You may not need a full, traditional business plan, but you at least need a <a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/businessplans/ht/how-to-write-a-simple-business-plan.htm" target="_blank">streamlined written document</a> that outlines a plan for getting from where you are now to where you want to be. Put it all down in writing and use that as a guide throughout the startup process.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Don&#8217;t Undercut the Competition</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, you want get your foot in the door, but you will never build a sustainable landscaping business by <a href="http://www.inc.com/erik-sherman/are-you-still-using-spray-and-pray-pricing.html" target="_blank">undercutting the competition</a> every step of the way. If you do, customers will only choose your business because it&#8217;s cheap, which means they&#8217;ll leave the second someone cheaper comes along. Establish your business as a quality provider by developing a competitive pricing strategy from the beginning.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Don&#8217;t Hire the Wrong People</strong></h2>
<p>As your business grows, you will probably need staff or subcontractors in order to provide prompt service to multiple customers, and the quality of people you hire will determine your success—or your failure. Your team is an extension your brand, so take the time you need to hire the right people.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Don&#8217;t Treat Your Landscaping Business Like a Summertime Hobby</strong></h2>
<p>Being located in a seasonal climate doesn&#8217;t mean you need to close up shop during the winter months. Create a year-round business opportunities by transitioning to snow removal or other cold-weather outdoor services. You can also use the slow season to perform equipment maintenance, update your business and marketing plans, and conduct team building exercises with your staff.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Don&#8217;t Skimp on Equipment</strong></h2>
<p>There are some areas where you can cut corners in the startup process, but equipment is not one of them, especially for a landscaping company. You don&#8217;t need to purchase brand new tools and equipment, but make sure you invest in what you need to get the job done without performance problems that can eat away at your profits.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Don&#8217;t Always Say No to Your Customers</strong></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to have a list of standard services you provide in your business, but being too rigid (i.e., not being willing to tailor timing of services to suit a client or adjust offerings to specific needs) may cost you business. You should also frequently survey your customers to see if there are gaps in your services that you could address to increase their levels of satisfaction.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Underestimate Word of Mouth Marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Most landscaping businesses operate in a clearly defined geographic area, which sets up the business to leverage the power of <a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/marketingsales/a/word-of-mouth-marketing.htm" target="_blank">word of mouth marketing</a>. The way it works is simple: Provide exceptional service that delights your customers, then encourage them to refer your business to others. Over time, this can have a snowball effect that launches your business to a new level.</p>
<p>As you get started with the launch of your landscaping business, watch out for and avoid these common mistakes in order to increase your chances of long-term success.</p>

An impressive <a href="http://www.mailigen.com/blog/infographic-segmented-emails-is-what-the-future-holds/" target="_blank">89% of marketers</a> say that email is their primary channel for lead generation. This is why email marketing is one of the most powerful customer acquisition tools available to business owners. It&#8217;s relatively inexpensive and can have tremendous benefits over time. The tips below will help you get your email marketing process on the right track so you can begin to build your customer base.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Use the Right Platform</strong></h2>
<p>In order to make email marketing an effective customer acquisition tool, you need a platform that allows you to build a list, create and send professional-looking messages, and track performance. You can&#8217;t get this functionality if you are using Outlook or Apple Mail to send bulk emails. You need a tool dedicated to email marketing. Some popular options include MailChimp, AWeber, Constant Contact, and Vertical Response. Explore the features of each, especially those that will help you grow your subscriber list, and choose the option that works best for your business.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Make Every Communication Relevant and Interesting</strong></h2>
<p>The more often your subscribers see messages from you or your company in their inboxes, the easier it will be for your business to build credibility. The trick, however, is not sending messages for the sake of sending messages, but instead being purposeful and relevant. A weekly or monthly newsletter is a great way to provide a summary of what&#8217;s happening in your business, content you recently published, or special offers you have available for customers. Check out MailChimp&#8217;s <a href="http://mailchimp.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-field-guide/html/" target="_blank">Marketing Field Guide</a> for more ideas on consistent messages you can send to your email list.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Review Your Customer Acquisition Tool&#8217;s Metrics Often</strong></h2>
<p>Metrics are a vital part of every email marketing campaign. There is no way to tell if you have an engaging subject line or effective email newsletter content until you see how many people opened your message and clicked on a link. Review the metrics after each campaign to see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If supported by your platform, try A/B testing your subject lines to see if you can devise a standard format that encourages opening.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Keep It Short, Sweet, and Pretty</strong></h2>
<p>Most people <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2011/01/email-usability-keeping-your-email-newsletters-short-and-sweet/" target="_blank">scan email messages</a> quickly, deciding in seconds if anything in the message is worth more of their attention. This is why you need to keep your messages relatively short, scannable with subheadings, and easy on the eyes. Most email marketing platforms have tools and templates that help you create email messages with effective formats that work on all types of devices, so explore the options you have available to make the best choice for your email format. Keep in mind that using the same format for each of your messages, instead of changing it up for every email you send, will help solidify your brand.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Include a Call to Action in Every Message</strong></h2>
<p>What do you want your audience to do with the emails you are sending them? Do you want them to click a link to read a blog post? Buy a product? Forward it to a friend? Sign up for a consultation? Visit your store? The most important part of every single email message is the call to action (CTA)—what you want your readers to do after receiving your message. Be clear, specific, and repetitive (within reason) to get your audience to act on the information you are sharing with them.</p>
<p>Email marketing is not a quick process; it takes time and consistent effort to be effective. Start building your list today so you can create a system for converting prospects into new customers.</p>
