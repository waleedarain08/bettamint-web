										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="young woman entrepreneur stands smiling in front of her desk" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How, exactly, does someone become an entrepreneur? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some individuals instinctively know that they want their careers to follow an entrepreneurial path. They may go to school for an MBA or find that they have a knack for starting businesses as early in life as a childhood lemonade stand. Others find opportunities in entrepreneurship out of necessity. During lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals started small businesses. This allowed them to pursue their passions and earn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, others discover entrepreneurship with a “Eureka!” moment for a new product or offering. Take the example of businesswoman Sara Blakely. Years ago, Blakely </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sara-blakely/how-sara-blakley-started-spanx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut the feet out of her control top pantyhose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to wear under a pair of pants to a party. Voila—the pants had no visible lines underneath. This remixed take on a traditional shaper allowed Blakely to create the patent for the shapewear we now know as Spanx. Today, Blakely is one of the world’s most famous entrepreneurs!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does someone reach that point and decide that they are ready to become an entrepreneur? The best way to get started answering this question is to discover your why.</span></p>
<h2>Discover your why</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you want to become an entrepreneur? Your “why” is the reason you want to start a business. One of these reasons below could be your “why” as an entrepreneur. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to make a difference in your community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You dream of turning your passion into your life’s work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have an idea for a new offering or service that you know will change people’s lives.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You enjoy learning by doing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re ready for a challenge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re passionate about finding your purpose.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as you know why, you’ll be ready to start setting short- and long-term goals for your startup.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need to start a business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a small business is no easy undertaking. There are plenty of challenges presented to those that commit to becoming an entrepreneur. However, if you know what to expect ahead of time you will be prepared to address each one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the most common challenges facing entrepreneurs in 2021 and suggested solutions for overcoming these issues.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes you qualified to start a business? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have several years of existing experience in the field. If you don’t have enough experience, or what is considered the right experience, consider upskilling. You can do this by enrolling in relevant online courses, watching webinars, and listening to podcasts to learn from experienced individuals. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner or solo?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you start the business on your own or would you like to go into business with a partner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that being in a partnership requires both partners to work equally together. Having a </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2021/05/business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written partnership agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be a big help in smoothly running the company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you wear many hats?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur, particularly in the early days in your startup’s lifecycle, means you will be doing the work of several people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it can be difficult to manage this much work especially if it is outside of your skill set. If hiring full-time isn’t a feasible option right now, consider outsourcing work to contractors or freelancers that have the skills to complete it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you acquire customers?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business idea should be viable and for an offering or service that customers actually want (and will pay for!). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start conducting market research to determine your target audience and establish buyer personas to better understand your demographics. You may also collect customer feedback through focus groups and surveys conducted via social media and in e-newsletters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the business receive funding?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fund the business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to quit your job to start a business, you’ll need a significant financial cushion to become an entrepreneur and attend to your finances and expenses. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may include financing from investors, taking out a business loan, applying for grants, using crowdfunding platforms, or attracting the interest of an angel investor or venture capitalist.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does work/life balance look like?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is true that becoming an entrepreneur means putting plenty of energy, time, and commitment into the business and its idea, the end result should not be one where you feel completely overwhelmed or burned out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider starting your small business as a side hustle before making the plunge to take it full-time. Use this time to grow the business and observe how you are able to maintain work-life balance. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a scaling strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As sales rise and your business enjoys a steady influx of cash flow, consider putting  together a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-entrepreneurs-reveal-how-they-scaled-their-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This may help  ensure your business keeps growing its revenue through its business model and may allow you to expand into new markets over time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful tools for entrepreneurs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur requires having an entrepreneurial toolkit. Here are some of the most critical components to include in your toolkit for success.</span></p>
<h3>Create a business plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/create-a-business-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will act as the foundation for which you can build your business. Think of it as a roadmap to becoming an entrepreneur. You may use a business plan to set goals (both short- and long-term) for your business to reach and set timelines to get to these goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business plan allows you to detail more about who you are and what the business does. You may use this space to analyze your competition through an industry analysis and your customers through a market analysis. A business plan allows you to share the financial projections of your company and outline a funding request from potential investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that a business plan may be revised over time. Take note as you reach certain goals—and begin planning for how to reach your future goals.</span></p>
<h3>Incorporate or form an LLC</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating or </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2020/08/sole-proprietors-form-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forming an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business is one of the best tools an entrepreneur has in their business toolkit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating as a business entity, like a limited liability company (LLC) or corporation, provides your business with limited liability protection. This creates a separation between your personal and professional assets. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, your personal belongings will not be impacted or used as collateral. Additionally, incorporating a business can provide tax benefits and allow you to establish credibility faster with consumers.</span></p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurship is not meant to be done alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need a network of the best and brightest in your corner. Some of these people may include mentors, close family members and friends, and other entrepreneurs that you admire—and that admire you in return! Remember to build your network as much as you continue to network and grow the business.</span></p>
<h3>Act with confidence</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur is hard work, but it is also rewarding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are doing it! You are working to create an offering or service that will change the lives of others for the better by bringing  this idea to life. Despite the challenges, entrepreneurship gives you a path to where you are able to find your purpose. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/success-ahead-for-women-entrepreneurs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe in yourself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, surround yourself with great people, work hard, and you can achieve your dreams and be successful.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_785151373-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Weighing options for your small business?" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_785151373-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_785151373.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several moving parts to consider when you decide to incorporate your business. Many entrepreneurs start by thinking about different entities, like a sole proprietor or limited liability company, they may choose to incorporate as that suits their needs. In addition, some may question when it is the best time to incorporate or if it is necessary to incorporate a business at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may seem like a lot of information to consider, the process of incorporation is actually much less overwhelming than it appears for entrepreneurs. Here is a breakdown of the basics you need to understand before incorporating a business.</span></p>
<h2>Choosing an Entity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entity formation you choose to incorporate your business will depend on a few factors. You will need to consider the type of business you are starting and plans to grow and expand the company over time. Some of the most popular entities include these three structures:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sole Proprietorship.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Almost every small business starts as a sole proprietorship, which is often referred to as a default entity. A sole proprietorship allows the owner of the company to exercise complete control over the business. This may be an ideal option for an entrepreneur that wishes to be the boss, as a sole proprietorship is responsible for everything that impacts the business. However, a sole proprietorship does not have limited liability. Without this added benefit, the business owner may be held liable for both good and bad things that impact the company. A sole proprietorship is also not privy to receiving as many tax benefits due to the unincorporated nature of the business. This means a sole proprietor is fully responsible for paying self-employment taxes to cover their Social Security and Medicare obligations. At times, this may amount to thousands of dollars — and can feel like a bit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much tax responsibility. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Limited Liability Company (LLC).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An LLC is a popular entity formation to incorporate your business. LLCs have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible management structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing more than one owner (member) to run the company. Limited liability protection is one of an LLC’s primary benefits. This creates a separation between the assets of the owner and the business. The separation ensures that the owner’s belongings, like houses and cars, are not used for collateral in the event of an unforeseen circumstance, like a lawsuit. An LLC may also choose the manner in which the entity would like to be taxed. LLCs, which are pass-through entities, are treated and taxed as partnerships on the federal level. They may elect to be taxed as another pass-through entity, such as an S Corporation. The result of that election means a limited liability company is able to avoid significant self-employment taxes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Corporation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This entity may be ideal for incorporating a business that has plans to create a global presence or offer an IPO. A corporation is a highly structured entity formation. Incorporating as a corporation means the business needs to elect a board of directors and corporate officers, take </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/11/corporate-minutes-bylaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during meetings, and establish bylaws. Corporations may also issue shares of stock and sell percentages of the business to its owners (shareholders). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are even more entity options available to incorporate your business. Some of these include partnerships, C Corporations, and S Corporations. If you are unsure as to which entity is the right fit for your business, meet with a legal or tax professional. Ask any questions you may have about the incorporation process, so you have peace of mind in moving ahead to incorporate your business. </span></p>
<h2>Best Time to Incorporate a Business</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a specific time of the year where it’s ideal to incorporate a business? Here’s an inside tip. There is no “best” or “worst” time of the year to start a business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may find, depending on your offerings and services, your company does well seasonally or has specific quarters where sales are strong. Consider such seasonal factors when deciding when you should start and incorporate a business. Planning a launch to happen prior to a peak in holiday tourism is one common strategy, whereas others prefer to launch at the start of the calendar year. “Start a business” may be a popular New Year’s resolution, which is why many entrepreneurs use the last few months of the year to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">draft business plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prepare for a January launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that you decide to start a business towards the end of the year, you may find it’s advantageous to consider a delayed filing rather than file a standard incorporation filing. This allows you to file your paperwork for the delayed filing and set an effective date of incorporation. This date is usually scheduled for about 30 to 90 days out into the future. Once the effective date arrives, the business’ incorporation paperwork will have been completed and the company will officially be in existence. This gives you the chance to start the year with a brand-new business. As a bonus, setting the effective date for the new year means that your business is not obligated to file or pay taxes or conduct annual maintenance for the previous year because you were not officially in existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, keep in mind that not every state allows delayed filing requests. You may need to check in with the local Secretary of State to determine if your state of incorporation offers delayed filings and how you can reserve a date.</span></p>
<h2>Why Should You Incorporate a Business?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it a good idea to incorporate your business? Technically, a small business may remain in its default entity as a sole proprietorship. It is still possible for a business to operate as an unincorporated entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unincorporated businesses may not realize that incorporation has many long-term benefits. When you incorporate your business, you receive limited liability protection. Tax responsibilities are lessened when electing a pass-through entity. It is easier to build business credit and to establish credibility with consumers. The credibility your business has, from industries ranging to medical to retail, allows the company to develop a strong brand reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, any entrepreneur that feels unsure about incorporating their business may wish to speak with a tax or legal professional. They may answer questions you have about the best entity for your offerings, states you may consider incorporating in, and how to elect a pass-through entity for tax purposes. Perhaps You’ll leave feeling more confident and secure once learning about the incorporation process.</span></p>

A business name needs to be able to differentiate your business from its competitors. It should be unique and original. The business name is also considered its trademark. This means the owner must register the business name and file for a federal trademark to avoid plagiarism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at key aspects involved in researching and registering a business name. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for naming a small business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I name my small business? Picking out a name for your business requires conducting a bit of research. It also means answering certain questions, such as whether the business name can be easily spelled and how the name is able to reflect the business and its brand. As you brainstorm ideas, follow these best practices for choosing a business name.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to spell</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are having a hard time spelling your business name, your customers are likely to face the same problem. Keep the name of your business easy to spell. A helpful rule of thumb to follow is </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/how-to-name-your-business-10-things-you-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">picking a business name</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is five to letters in length and contains at least one consonant.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to pronounce</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This goes hand-in-hand with the tip about spelling. The name of your business will appear everywhere, from signage in storefronts to social media handles. It should be easy for anyone to pronounce the name of your business. Moreover, the name should also sound appealing to your target audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try saying the name of the business out loud. Listen to how it sounds. Can you understand what the business does or offers just from hearing its name? Is it meaningful or aesthetically pleasing? You may ask for a second opinion through a family member or friend or associate of the business. Take everyone’s feedback into consideration for a business name that makes sense and sounds good.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid clutter</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might look cool to have a business name full of special symbols like dollar signs or numbers. However, this may confuse customers whenever they try to recall the startup’s name. It can also lead to difficulty later on when picking out a domain name for the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your business name free of clutter. Avoid using hyphens, numbers, and other special symbols. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t depend on clichés</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember to always look at the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">core of the business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is its value proposition? What does it do and offer that is unique in its industry? Try to avoid thinking so far outside the box it confuses everyone. Keep the name of the business as succinct and specific as possible. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider relevant keywords</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tends to be a helpful strategy when determining your domain name, and it is also true of picking a small business name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider using relevant keywords when naming your startup. A bakery that sells cakes, for example, may use the word “cakes” somewhere in its business name. (A good example of this is Susiecakes, a California-based bakery and sweet shop.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords allow you to better detail your offerings. This translates well for SEO purposes once you begin choosing a domain name. Customers typing relevant keywords into Google search will be able to better find your business. In the long run, this strategy does more than allow new and existing customers to find you online. Using keywords can help increase your overall site traffic and search engine rank. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review lowercase URL</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business named </span><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-domain-names/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speed of Art”</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on a website may translate to “Speedofart” in its domain name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unintentional punch line may be in your business name once it is viewed in lowercase and all as one word in its domain name. Review this name carefully to avoid any potentially embarrassing situations!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t rush</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro tip: take your time when determining your business name. The name of your business should be unique and memorable. Figuring out a name like that may take a little extra effort. You may find it’s helpful to brainstorm a few options for your business, especially once you start preparing for trademark registration.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a name search</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a few options ready for your small business name, it’s time to conduct a name search. This name search allows you to check on business name availability before you register the business name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few approaches you may use for conducting a search. Entrepreneurs may decide to search through a trademark database. The USPTO offers a trademark database called </span><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for entrepreneurs to conduct a name search. When looking up the name, you will be able to see if any trademarks have already been registered under that name or are pending registration. Additionally, you can find marks that are similar to your trademark or are used on related products or for related services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have the bandwidth to conduct a search like that, it’s okay. Third-party </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporation filing organizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that provide trademark search offerings may assist you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct a domain name search</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like conducting a name search for a trademark, a similar search may be conducted for domain names. It may be a good idea to brainstorm a few options that could serve as domain names if your exact name is not available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the domain name extension you would like as well. This may range from options like dot-com (.com) to dot-org (.org). The extension you choose will depend on the kind of business you’re starting. For example, a nonprofit will likely choose a dot-org domain name extension. It is recommended that most businesses choose a dot-com extension when possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dot-com extension, which was initially introduced for eCommerce websites, is now considered the default domain extension. Studies show that over </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-pick-a-domain-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of all websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use dot-com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the popularity of a dot-com extension may make it difficult to obtain, it is worth it for several reasons. Dot-com extensions are among the </span><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/most-common-domain-extensions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most popular top-level domains (TLDs)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as these domains carry plenty of backlink clout and can even lead to better search rankings from an SEO perspective.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider Trademark Monitoring Services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some third-party incorporation filing organizations may offer trademark monitoring services. This service helps to monitor your trademark application to ensure nobody else attempts to use your unique business name while it is pending registration. If an outside source does attempt to do so, the third-party incorporation service can quickly respond to that attempt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a monitoring service may also provide entrepreneurs with detailed reports about any new registrations that could involve possible conflicting marks. It gives entrepreneurs peace of mind in knowing their mark, while pending, is protected from possible </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2018/02/avoid-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trademark infringement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filing trademark registration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have brainstormed several business names and conducted a name search to ensure that they are available for trademark use. Now it’s time to secure the name. This is done by registering a business name as a trademark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some benefits of trademark registration? Filing for trademark registration allows you to protect your startup’s valuable intellectual property. It gives you exclusive rights to the mark. This means that nobody is allowed to legally use this trademark without the owner’s permission. Any attempts would be considered trademark infringement and may result in a lawsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filing for trademark registration may be done directly with your state of incorporation’s Secretary of State. The Secretary of State will provide you with the necessary trademark application. Business owners will share information about who they are, what their business does, and the mark they wish to register. Each state will differ with its types of trademark questions, including answering some of the following questions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A written description of the mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A brief description of goods and services used in connection with the mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the mark is used in connection with these goods and services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number and class of goods and services connected with the mark.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dates for which the mark has been used in business by its applicant and in its state of formation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon completing the trademark filing application, you will need to sign and date the document and mail (or email) it to the appropriate Secretary of State’s office address. A filing fee must also be made payable </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(typically) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a check, money order, or credit card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some states, such as Missouri, may also request to see </span><a href="https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Business/tmsm16A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">samples of the mark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This may range from business cards to advertisements. Filing requirements do differ from state to state, so it’s wise to check in with your local Secretary of State before submitting your filing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that you do not have the bandwidth to complete and file a trademark application, you may also work alongside a third-party trademark filing service. They will ask you a few questions about your business and help prepare your trademark application for you. The added assistance of experts makes it even easier to protect and register your business name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In closing, it is possible to run a business without registering its trademarks. However, this puts your valuable intellectual property at risk of infringement. Rather than take that risk, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">think about registering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your trademark. Ensure your business has exclusive rights to the mark from day one of starting your business.</span></p>

The IRS has extended the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-extends-additional-tax-deadlines-for-individuals-to-may-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal income tax filing deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from April 15, 2021 to May 17, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This filing extension gives taxpayers a bit of extra time to file their taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal income tax extension aside, all other deadlines for filing small business taxes appear to be on schedule for this year. Of course, the kinds of taxes small business owners pay will vary depending on its entity formation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s examine what small business taxes may look like for a limited liability company (LLC). What kinds of taxes can an LLC expect to pay and what are some upcoming deadlines to be mindful of in Q2 and beyond?</span></p>
<h2>LLCs and “pass-through” tax treatment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several benefits that come with forming an LLC. An LLC provides its owners with limited liability. This separates and protects personal assets belonging to the business owner in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. In addition, you may be able to build credibility with customers faster as an incorporated business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLCs are what is referred to as a “pass-through” entity. This means that the profits of the business pass through to the owners (</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also known as members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). An LLC’s members report profits and losses on their individual tax returns, and not at the business level. The flexibility of a pass-through entity ensures that the LLC is able to legally avoid double taxation. An LLC is taxed only once at the individual level, not twice as it might be under a different entity like a C Corporation.</span></p>
<h2>LLCs and entity classification election</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that while an LLC is a pass-through entity, it may be </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">treated as a partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the IRS. This is the entity’s default federal tax classification. A single member LLC, for example, may also be treated by the IRS as a sole proprietorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this does not mean an LLC may be taxed as a partnership or sole proprietorship. The entity must specify how it would like to be classified for federal income tax purposes. In order to make this specification, an LLC must file </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 8832</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This allows the LLC to elect to be classified as an association taxable as a specific entity, like an S Corporation.</span></p>
<h2>S Corporation tax election</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, many small business owners will choose to have their LLC taxed as an S Corporation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why elect this status and what kind of impact does an S Corp have on small business taxes? An S Corporation is also a </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/10/forming-s-corporation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pass-through entity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Income passes through to the individual level to avoid double taxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, LLCs face eligibility requirements before it can set up as an S Corporation. The business must be able to meet certain ownership and stock criteria. Some examples include that the business may not have more than 100 shareholders, that the shareholders are all individual personas, and the business only has a single class of stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have an understanding of an LLC as a pass-through entity, how to elect a different tax classification, and why S Corporations are the preferred tax election. Let’s review some of the taxes an LLC needs to file and the suggested forms necessary for these filings.</span></p>
<h2>Small business taxes for Q2 (and beyond)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small businesses, tax season is not limited to one day each year. Do not focus solely on federal and state income </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consider these additional small business taxes and payments in Q2 and beyond.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Income taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remember that what an LLC pays is ultimately determined by the way it elects to be taxed with the IRS. Otherwise, an LLC pays income taxes through its default federal tax classification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Estimated taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is for sole proprietors, S Corporation shareholders, and self-employed individuals that owe $1,000 or more in taxes. These taxes are paid through estimated tax payments. Typically, these payments are made four times throughout the year. The deadlines for the remaining 2021 quarters are April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 18, 2022. Use </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 1040-ES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine your estimated tax payments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Self-employment taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tax is paid by self-employed workers. It acts as a social security and Medicare tax. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employment taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Businesses that have employees will withhold payroll taxes in order to fund social security and Medicare. Employers also withhold FICA tax, federal income, and federal unemployment (FUTA) tax from employee wages. FICA taxes may be reported using </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 941</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Do you have more tax questions?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think you might be missing out on any small business tax credits or deductions? Did your small business utilize COVID-19 resources and you have questions as to how this may impact filing small business taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I personally cannot provide tax advice, I do recommend getting the proper tax help. Reach out to a trusted tax professional. Seek out the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right tax professional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business, which may range from a CPA, bookkeeper, or accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the topics you address may include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask questions about tax credits and deductions you may be entitled to for a potential tax refund. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review tools that can help you better stay organized with your tax documents and deadlines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look into which business records you should keep and why it’s good to hold on to these documents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk about your LLC. If you’re unsure of whether you should elect an S Corp filing or have any other questions that pertain to the business, a tax professional will be able to guide you.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also work with a tax professional to plan ahead for upcoming quarters in business. Look into upcoming deadlines for additional tax payments. Let your tax professional provide assistance year-round for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sooner you are able to meet with a professional ahead of the May 17, 2021 deadline, the more you’ll have the peace of mind in knowing you were able to file your taxes correctly and will be able to tackle upcoming tax deadlines with confidence and careful organization.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Young woman entrepreneur working from home" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking an entity formation for your startup isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation. A startup’s entity formation depends on the needs of the business. Generally speaking, however, there are three entity formation types that most entrepreneurs choose to incorporate their organization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sole Proprietorship</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Liability Company (LLC)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporation </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some businesses may decide they would like to form a limited liability company, or LLC, because of the entity’s flexibility. Others may choose to incorporate as a corporation, especially if they plan to expand the business and open up global locations. And some entrepreneurs may stick with the default entity formation of a sole proprietorship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we will look at three entity formation types that are popular for incorporating a business, the benefits of each legal entity, and how to start the registration process. </span></p>
<h2>What does it meant to incorporate?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the word “incorporate” when discussing small business. However, not everyone knows the definition of this word. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporation is the process of creating a corporate business structure. That structure allows the business to act as a separate, legal entity from its owner. The owner also receives limited liability protection because it has incorporated. Liability protection creates a separation between the assets belonging to the owner and those belonging to the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you need limited liability when running a business? Let’s say your business experiences an unforeseen circumstance, like accumulating too much business debt it is unable to pay off in a timely manner. If you had not incorporated, your personal assets may be at risk of seizure. Your house or car could be used as collateral to repay the debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, incorporation separates the assets of the business and owner. The owner’s personal belongings would not be impacted because the business incorporated as a business entity. </span></p>
<h2>Sole Proprietorship</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sole proprietorship is often known as a default entity formation. Essentially, that means many businesses begin as a sole proprietor for a few reasons. It’s an affordable entity formation with the least amount of paperwork involved in the filing process. However, one of the primary draws for being a sole proprietor is that this entity formation allows entrepreneurs to be the boss. They get to be in charge of everything and call the shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds pretty good, right? There is one catch. Sole proprietors are responsible for good things impacting the business—and bad things, too. What if a customer is injured on their property or valuable information is lost during a security breach? A sole proprietor would need to be prepared to take full responsibility for these incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes this can prove to be too much responsibility in a sole proprietorship. If this is the case, they may choose to incorporate as an entity formation where there is limited liability to protect their assets. Many sole proprietors will </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2020/08/sole-proprietors-form-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gives them access to limited liability. It allows the business owner to keep running the company with extra peace of mind that their business has extra protection. </span></p>
<h2>LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LLC is a popular entity formation for several reasons. Forming an LLC means businesses have the ability to access limited liability protection for personal and professional assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner of the LLC, also known as a member, may also choose a flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the LLC. Three options are available, including single member LLC, member managed LLC, and manager managed LLC. In a single member LLC, for example, the sole owner manages the LLC. Whereas a member managed LLC would be managed by multiple members of the LLC and a manager managed LLC would allow the LLC to appoint a board of managers to run the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major appeal in forming an LLC is choosing how you would like the entity taxed. LLCs are taxed as a pass-through entity by default. This means profits “pass-through” to members and are reported on individual tax returns instead of at the business level. Members of the LLC may also deduct losses on their personal tax returns to further offset income and ease tax filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLCs, which are treated and taxed as a partnership on the federal level, often elect to be taxed as a different entity. For example, let’s say an LLC elects to be taxed as an S Corporation. This type of corporation has a pass-through entity status, which allows LLCs to be taxed as a pass-through entity. This helps avoid significant self-employment taxes for the LLC. Incidentally, sole proprietors are also responsible for paying self-employment taxes—which is another good reason to consider incorporating as an LLC!</span></p>
<h2>Corporation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the three entity formations, a corporation is the most structured entity. It shares certain similarities with LLCs, including limited liability and the ability to elect as an S Corp for tax purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a corporation is not nearly as flexible as an LLC. Corporations require formal structures to run their business. This includes electing a board of directors and corporate officers. Corporate minutes must be taken during meetings and bylaws must be established as the corporation’s </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/11/corporate-minutes-bylaws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules and regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A corporation may issue shares of stock and sell percentages of the business to its owners, which are also known as shareholders. Ideally, this is the kind of entity that may be the best fit for a business with plans to go public, offer an IPO, and launch a worldwide presence. </span></p>
<h2>Which entity formation should I incorporate as?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three entity formation types are only a handful of business entities available to incorporate as. Entrepreneurs may also explore Certified B Corporations, partnerships, and C Corporations. Much of the decision depends on the business and its needs. If you have any questions about which entity to incorporate as, consult a legal professional for additional advice.</span></p>

The answer is a combination of meeting internal and external business compliance requirements as determined by its state of incorporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internal requirements, as defined by the United States Small Business Administration (SBA), are forms of record-keeping for </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/manage-your-business/stay-legally-compliant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporated businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Record-keeping varies depending on your entity formation. An LLC, for example, would need to update an operating agreement. Meanwhile, corporations would need to update corporate bylaws and keep detailed minutes of meetings to remain compliant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">External business compliance focuses on state and federal filing requirements. Small businesses may need to file, pay for, or renew the following essentials:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File an annual report</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay statement fees and franchise tax</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtain an employer identification number (EIN)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designate a registered agent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">File articles of amendment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renew business licenses, permits, and certificates</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Why is compliance important in business?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does business compliance matter? Keeping records up to date provides the Secretary of State with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/2021-small-business-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accurate information about the business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This keeps the business in good standing. A business may fall into bad standing if it does not complete annual filings or pay relevant fees. What if this happens? The small business may be at risk of being involuntarily dissolved, and closed, by the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s quite easy to manage compliance once you know which areas require your focus. Stay in good standing by fulfilling these internal and external compliance requirements in our small business compliance guide. </span></p>
<h2>Updating operating agreements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that have incorporated as an LLC may draft a written operating agreement. An operating agreement provides the rules, structure, and regulations for running the LLC. This includes information about ownership, rights and responsibilities of the LLC’s members, rules for joining and leaving the LLC, and dissolution of the entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not always a requirement for an LLC to have a written agreement. However, it is strongly advised that LLCs do write out an operating agreement for business compliance purposes. This allows members to refer back to the written document with any questions. In the event that the state needs to see the operating agreement, you will be able to readily share it and prove the validity of the LLC. Update this document each year to detail any changes made in the business.</span></p>
<h2>Updating corporate bylaws</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that incorporate as corporations are typically required to draft bylaws. </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/11/corporate-minutes-bylaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate bylaws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> share similarities with LLC operating agreements. Bylaws detail the corporation’s rules and regulations. Information for conducting meetings, the functions of each corporate office, and shareholder voting formalities may also be found in bylaws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If key details change about the corporation’s internal management structure, bylaws must be updated accordingly for internal business compliance purposes.</span></p>
<h2>Recording corporate minutes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minutes are records of notes taken during corporate meetings. Minutes should be extremely detailed, legible, and taken in chronological order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These documents do not need to be updated after they have been taken during meetings. However, it is typically required to take minutes during each meeting within the corporation for posterity and to serve as a point of reference. </span></p>
<h2>Filing annual reports</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An annual report acts as a record of changes and the yearly activities within  a business throughout the year. If an LLC appoints new members, for example, its annual report filing will reflect updates on the names and addresses of the LLC’s new members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are annual reports and initial reports the same thing? No. An initial report is filed at the offset of incorporating or forming an LLC for a business. It is generally only filed once while annual reports are filed by predetermined dates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual reports are filed on an annual, or biennial, basis. Filing rules may differ depending on your state of incorporation. Check in with the local Secretary of State to determine whether your business needs to file annually or biennially and for the filing deadline.</span></p>
<h2>Paying statement fees and franchise tax</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement fees are paid with annual or biennial reports. Fees may range depending on the state of incorporation. Franchise tax is another critical aspect of business compliance if the state of incorporation charges corporations and LLCs for these fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying these fees in a timely manner is an important aspect of small business compliance. If they are not paid on time, your business may be charged with late fees which can be much more expensive. It is also possible that small businesses may be penalized by the state for late payments, so it is advised to pay any outstanding fees ahead of schedule.</span></p>
<h2>Obtaining an EIN</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EIN is an employer identification number. It is also referred to as a tax ID. Businesses that incorporate or form an LLC are issued an EIN by the IRS. This identifies employer tax accounts and ensures the business is collecting payroll taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where else can an EIN be useful and ensure business compliance? An EIN is required if your business decides to hire employees. You will also need an EIN if you decide to open a business bank account or to build corporate business credit.</span></p>
<h2>Designating a registered agent</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of contact between a small business and its state of incorporation is a registered agent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A registered agent may be an individual or third-party organization that accepts service of process on behalf of your business. The registered agent will organize these documents and pass the paperwork along to the business owner in a timely, discrete manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered agents must be residents in the state in which they do business. They must have a physical street address to accept this paperwork and be available during general business hours Monday through Friday. A business owner may also act as their own registered agent. However, they must be able to fulfill these requirements or else their business runs the risk of falling out of compliance. </span></p>
<h2>Renewing business licenses and permits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses generally require certain business licenses and permits to operate their companies. These vary depending on the company’s industry, its location (city and/or county), and the state of incorporation. Once a small business has obtained a specific business license or permit, they will need to renew it as per state requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure which business licenses you need? Consider doing business license research with the Secretary of State to see which licenses and permits are applicable to your business. </span></p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a small business requires fulfilling a number of tasks. Filing necessary paperwork, paying taxes and fees on time, and submitting reports and renewals on an annual basis help keep the company running smoothly. Doing each activity signals to the state that your business is active and is prioritizing its business compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure that you’re in good standing or need more information about areas of business compliance as it pertains to your specific business, get in touch with your local Secretary of State. You may need to complete additional paperwork, such as filing articles of amendment, obtaining a DBA, or ordering a certificate of good standing, that further allows your business to fulfill its filing requirements. They’ll be able to answer your questions and guide you to the appropriate point of contact as necessary for any and all compliance issues.</span></p>

This paperwork allows entrepreneurs to form a corporation or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limited liability company (LLC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A business that is incorporating as a corporation must file articles of incorporation. Companies that are forming an LLC file articles of organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are articles of organization? Is there a difference between articles of incorporation versus articles of organization? Let’s define the two types of documentation, their basic information, and frequently asked questions as it pertains to incorporated businesses.</span></p>
<h2>Articles of Incorporation</h2>
<h3>What are articles of incorporation?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that would like to be established as a corporation must file articles of incorporation. This is a requirement within your state of formation and for businesses that chose a corporation as their business entity. Once the Secretary of State has received and processed articles of incorporation, the information in the application becomes part of the corporation’s public record.</span></p>
<h3>What should be included in articles of incorporation?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does an entrepreneur write articles of incorporation? Typically, this is a form that entrepreneurs can download and fill out from the Secretary of State’s office. It includes basic information about the corporation. This may include, but is not limited to, answering the following questions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the corporation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical, and mailing, address of the corporation’s principal office. (This must be a street address as a P.O. Box does not count.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of shares the corporation has the authority to issue. Some articles of incorporation may also request the par value of each share.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name and street address of the registered agent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary purpose of the corporation or purpose for which the corporation is formed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name(s) and street address(es) of the incorporator(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The date, print name(s) of the incorporator(s), and signature(s).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that every state of incorporation is different. Some states may require more information about the corporation in their articles of incorporation. For example, this may include checking off boxes that state how the corporation is organized such as non-profit, non-stock, or for profit. Questions may also be asked about whether the corporation will have members or elect to be organized for purposes as a benefit corporation. Make sure to answer each question accurately. Review with all other incorporator(s) before signing the document. </span></p>
<h3>Where do I file articles of incorporation?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to file articles of incorporation? It’s wise to check in with the local Secretary of State before submitting the form. Articles of incorporation are accompanied by a filing fee. Checks, money orders, and credit cards may be used to pay this fee. It is still a good idea to check in with the Secretary of State and make sure you are using an accepted form of payment. If there is a designated party that the payment should be made towards, make note of that when writing out a check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Secretary of State will outline the way in which you may file articles of incorporation. Most offices have walk-in drop offs (side note—these may be limited due to COVID-19), fax, and online filing options available to entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<h2>Articles of Organization</h2>
<h3>What are articles of organization?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an entrepreneur chooses to form an LLC, they will need to file articles of organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articles of organization share some similarities with articles of incorporation. This document contains basic information about businesses that wish to be established as an LLC. It is required in most states of formation to file articles of organization if you choose an LLC as your business entity. Articles of organization must also be filed prior to conducting business as an LLC.</span></p>
<h3>What should be included in articles of organization?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articles of organization includes basic information about the LLC, answering the following questions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name of the limited liability company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Street and mailing address of the principal place of business of the LLC. (Some articles of organization ask for this information separately, as some LLCs may have different street and mailing addresses.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective date of filing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name and street address of the LLC’s registered agent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name(s) and address(es) of the LLC’s member(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the LLC will be vested in members or managers. An LLC may be formed under one of three LLC structures. These include a single member LLC (which is a standard LLC), member managed LLC, and manager managed LLC. Typically, there is a box that can be checked off on articles of organization that alerts the state about the LLC’s structure status.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name(s) and address(es) of the LLC’s member(s) if member managed or managers if manager managed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date, print or typed name(s), and signature(s) of person(s) forming the LLC.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to that of filing articles of incorporation, articles of organization may come with additional questions. Some states may request more information about whether the LLC is an at-will or term company. Others may wish to know if the LLC is a veteran-owned organization or the purpose for which the LLC is formed. This will vary depending on the state so be mindful to include the proper answers to these questions. Review the answers with the LLC’s members prior to filing the application.</span></p>
<h3>Where do I file articles of organization?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to file articles of organization for the LLC? Prior to filing the completed application, check in with the local Secretary of State. Similar to articles of incorporation, articles of organization are also accompanied by a filing fee. Checks, money orders, and credit cards may be used to pay this fee. Review with the Secretary of State beforehand to make sure you are using an accepted form of payment and making the payment out to the appropriate point of contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the Secretary of State will outline the way in which you may file articles of organization. Most offices have walk-in drop offs (side note — these may be limited due to COVID-19), fax, and online filing options available to entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions about incorporation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have learned what it means to file articles of incorporation for a corporation and how to file articles of organization for an LLC. Both of these filings, while similar in requesting information, do fulfill different purposes for their respective business entities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are still a few questions entrepreneurs have about these articles. Below you will find answers to commonly asked questions.</span></p>
<h3>Does a sole proprietor need articles of incorporation?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. Articles of incorporation are necessary to file for businesses that would like to be established as corporations. Sole proprietors have the least amount of paperwork and filing responsibilities due to the nature of their entity formation. A sole proprietor is an unincorporated entity. Sole proprietorships may draft a business plan for their company, for example, but have fewer filing requirements than incorporated businesses.</span></p>
<h3>Does a nonprofit need articles of incorporation?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This depends on the nature of the nonprofit entity. If you are filing as a nonprofit corporation, for example, you must complete articles of incorporation for domestic nonprofits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filing articles of incorporation for nonprofit corporations is quite similar to that of filing for a corporation. You will need to include the name of the nonprofit corporation, information about the nonprofit’s street address and registered agent, and print names and signatures of authorized officer(s). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the corporation, however, will differ to fit the nonprofit’s needs. Often, most of these filing documents require you to check off if you are filing as a public, mutual, or religious nonprofit corporation. It’s also important to note that the filing fees for nonprofit corporations and their articles of incorporation tend to be slightly less expensive than those for corporations. Check in with your local Secretary of State to find out how much you may expect to pay for a filing fee. </span></p>
<h3>Are articles of incorporation confidential?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information in an articles of incorporation application becomes part of the corporation’s public record. As such, the information provided is not considered confidential for corporations. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1609771261-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S corporation." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1609771261-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/shutterstock_1609771261.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business incorporated as an S Corporation, you are probably familiar with the S Corp tax deadline March 15. This is the tax deadline for S Corporations to file their annual tax return. The March 15 deadline will be the same tax filing deadline for S Corps in 2022. (This tax filing deadline is only subject to change if March 15 falls on a weekend or a holiday.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is an S Corporation? What does it mean to elect S Corp status? Do you know which documents this entity needs to file its tax return? Let’s take a look at how to prepare for the S Corp tax return deadline.</span></p>
<h2>What is an S Corporation?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S Corporations are corporations with a “pass-through” entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits may pass through to shareholders. These shareholders report taxable activity of the company on their personal income tax returns. In return, the corporation does not pay federal and state income tax. An S Corp is legally able to avoid what is known as double taxation. </span></p>
<h2>S Corporation benefits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electing S Corp status is often a popular choice when filing taxes with entity formations like limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations. In addition to pass-through taxes, forming an S Corp provides entrepreneurs with limited liability protection and separating personal and professional assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An S Corp election also reduces self-employment tax liabilities. For instance, the S Corp’s shareholders may act as employees. The shareholders, now employees, receive a salary and dividends, helping to reduce self-employment tax liabilities. </span></p>
<h2>S Corp eligibility</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think your corporation has what it takes to elect S Corp status? According to the IRS, you’ll need to fulfill </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S Corp eligibility requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This covers ownership criteria as well as stock criteria to qualify as an S Corporation.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business must be incorporated as a domestic corporation. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A registered agent service must be designated to the business. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business may not have more than 100 shareholders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shareholders of the business must be individual persons. Nonresident aliens may not be shareholders.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business must have a single class of stock.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the business may not be an ineligible corporation. As stated by the IRS, this includes certain financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your corporation eligible for S Corp status? Great news! The corporation must file </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 2553</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election by a Small Business Corporation. Each shareholder of the S Corp needs to sign this form before it is submitted to the appropriate address or faxed to the specific fax number. (All information is outlined on the first page of Form 2553.)</span></p>
<h2>Filing S Corp annual tax returns</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an S Corporation, it is your responsibility to file annual tax returns. What kinds of paperwork does that require? Let’s take a look at the two documents your S Corp requires.</span></p>
<h2>Form 1120S</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120s.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 1120S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation. This form contains fairly basic information about the S Corp. Filing Form 1120S allows the S Corp to share with the IRS their financial activity throughout the last calendar year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if Form 1120S is filed after March 15 or its tax extension deadline? (More about that IRS extension option in a moment!) The S Corp will be penalized by the IRS for its failure to file on time. A penalty fee must be paid. The </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1120s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for returns due after 2019 that are over 60 days late, according to the IRS, has increased to the smaller of the tax due or $435. </span></p>
<h2>Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1065sk1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule K-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines the partner’s share of income, deductions, and credits in the S Corporation. Each partner, or shareholder, in the S Corporation must complete this form and include it with Form 1120S. </span></p>
<h2>Can I get a filing extension?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tax extension may be necessary for S Corporations, depending on their unique business needs. If you know your S Corp will need an extension for filing its annual tax returns, complete and file </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f7004.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 7004</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns. Once your S Corp is approved for an IRS extension, be mindful of its filing due date and file by the deadline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you still have more questions about filing S Corporation taxes? While the tips I provided above can help S Corps prepare for tax filing deadlines, I am not personally able to provide legal or financial advice. If you have additional questions about the tax or filing process, it’s a good idea to meet with a tax professional. Talk to an account or CPA for extra guidance. As a final pro tip, book the appointment as soon as possible so your S Corp may meet the March 15 deadline. </span></p>

A business that decides to incorporate as an LLC has the opportunity to form one of three LLC structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Member LLC</li>
<li>Member Managed LLC</li>
<li>Manager Managed LLC</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the difference between each of these management structures as opposed to a standard LLC? Let’s take a closer look at what it means to incorporate as an LLC and what each <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">management structure</a> can do to benefit your business.</p>
<h2>What Does LLC Mean?</h2>
<p>A limited liability company, often abbreviated as LLC, is a business structure. A small business that chooses to <a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/04/llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporate as an LLC</a> receives limited liability protection. This creates a separation between professional assets and personal assets, like houses and cars, that belong to the entrepreneur. In the event of an unforeseen circumstance, such as a lawsuit or business debt, having incorporated as an LLC ensures that the owner’s <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personal assets</a> are not negatively impacted.</p>
<p>Incorporating as an LLC turns you, the owner of the business, into a member. You are still the business owner. Now, you hold membership interest since you incorporated as a limited liability company.</p>
<p>An LLC may have just one sole member. It may also have multiple members as a multi member LLC. This is particularly true of LLCs that are member managed versus manager managed. Let’s review these three LLC structures to learn more about member managed versus manager managed LLCs as well as single member LLCs.</p>
<h2>Single Member LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest differences a single member LLC has versus a standard LLC is in its name. A </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2014/02/business-basics-single-member-llc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single member LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only has one sole member. Standard LLCs, however, may bring on multi members to run the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it easier to run a single member LLC? Upon first glance, this type of LLC structure almost looks like the proverbial sole proprietorship of the LLC family tree. However, single member LLCs face their own unique management challenges. A standard LLC is </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-partnership-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">treated as a partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the federal level. A single member LLC, on the other hand, is not considered to be a partnership.</span></p>
<h2>How to Incorporate as a Single Member LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does that mean for entrepreneurs incorporating as single member LLCs? It is up to the single member to have, and maintain, proof that they are able to run operations within a single member LLC like a standard LLC and treat the business like a separate entity. Parts of said proof may include drafting a single member LLC operating agreement and taking minutes during meetings. Failure to do this may result in having your liability protection revoked. It may feel a little silly, even unnecessary, to do all this paperwork since you are the LLC’s only member. However, it’s worth taking the time and effort to maintain a single member LLC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each state in the United States recognizes single member LLC formations. This means you can start a business from any state as a single member LLC. The process for forming a single member LLC is also quite similar to a standard LLC formation. An entrepreneur files their articles of organization with the designated Secretary of State and pays the associated filing fee. Keep in mind that articles of organization will ask for all of the LLC’s members. It’s perfectly acceptable to list only yourself on the documents. After all, you’re filing as a single member LLC.</span></p>
<h2>Member Managed LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does member managed LLC mean? Each member in a member managed LLC is treated as an equal. In this management structure, each member shares the same amount of responsibility for how the LLC’s operations are run on a day-to-day basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does a member managed LLC have a board of directors? No. This is due to the equality of its members. Having a board of directors would disrupt the entity’s natural equality balance. </span></p>
<h2>How to Incorporate as a Member Managed LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal business to form a member managed LLC is one where the members all want to be equally involved with running the company. It is also a suitable fit for small businesses with limited resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before filing to form a member managed LLC, make sure you specify that the business will be member managed on your application forms. Most LLC articles of organization will let you check off a box indicting that you are forming a member managed LLC versus a manager managed LLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, you may submit the organizational form and pay the filing fee to the Secretary of State. As with a single member LLC, it’s also important that you keep and maintain up-to-date operating agreements. The duties of the members in a member managed LLC may be equal, but they must be documented for the sake of both clarification and posterity in the business.</span></p>
<h2>Manager Managed LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve reviewed what to do as a single member LLC and as a member that shares equal duties in a member managed LLC. Manager managed LLCs, however, tend to be the most complicated of the three LLC structures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between a member managed and manager managed LLC? Manager managed LLCs come with a board of managers. This is similar to a board of directors. The board of managers has more control over the business than the members do and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/buy-out-your-business-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">take more responsibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its operations.</span></p>
<h2>How to Incorporate as A Manager Managed LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A manager managed LLC is the most structured of the three management structures. However, this can also serve to the members’ benefit in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an LLC has too many members and struggles to delegate duties to each one, then it would be helpful to have a board of managers in place for organizational purposes. Conversely, some members of an LLC may not want the responsibility of running the business—and the board in managers is there to step in as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A board of managers doesn’t have to be entirely composed of the LLC’s members either. Manager managed LLCs may hire non-members to sit on the board as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like filing to form a member managed LLC, manager managed LLCs must indicate that their company is manager managed on their paperwork. Once they have made that readily clear, they may submit their formation paperwork in and pay the filing fee.</span></p>
<h2>Which LLC Structure Is Best For Business?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every small business is different, so I cannot advise with certainty whether one of these three management structures — single member LLC, member managed LLC, and manager managed LLC—is the best fit for your company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unsure of which to incorporate as, consult with an attorney or legal professional. Ask them any questions about the process you may have and work together to determine the proper LLC structure for you and your business.</span></p>
