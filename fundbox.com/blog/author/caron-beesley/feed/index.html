										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="474" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Women-Printing-Receipt" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt-.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a profit and loss statement? There are many financial statements that your business should maintain and refer to, key among these is your profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement. But why is it so important, what can you learn from it, and how do you calculate P&amp;L? Below are answers to these and other frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What does the profit and loss statement show?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement is an important indicator of your business’ health – across its lifecycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, it can tell you if you’ve reached break-even point. This is the point at which the total cost of goods produced or sold equals the revenue the business makes. Understanding your break-even point can help you price your products, set revenue targets, and identify missing expenses. It’s also a critical part of your business plan. Investors will want to know at what point you stop losing money and begin to turn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement will also show how your business performs over time; breaking down revenue generated, and expenses incurred. With these insights, you can see how profitable your business is and how much cash is left over after your losses are accounted. These funds can be used to grow your business, pay off debt, or contribute to your salary as a business owner. The statement also informs where you may need to cut costs to reduce losses and drive revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you are an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will use your P&amp;L statement to report profits and losses on your individual tax return. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you calculate P&amp;L?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your P&amp;L statement will draw on the following data points and calculations: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Sales (or revenue) &#8211; Cost of Sales (or Cost of Goods Sold) = </span><b>Gross Profit (or Gross Margin)</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross Profit &#8211; Operating Expenses = </span><b>Net Operating Profit</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Operating Profit + Other Income &#8211; Other Expenses = </span><b>Net Profit Before Taxes </b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Profit Before Taxes &#8211; Income Taxes = </span><b>Net Profit (or Loss)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These terms can be confusing. Let’s look at what each means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The net sales your business made during a certain period. This data point should reflect revenue from your primary business activity but also any gains from other activities such as the sale of assets.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The calculation of all the costs involved in manufacturing or selling a product. These typically include materials, transportation, storage, and labor costs. Knowing your cost of goods sold can help you determine how to price your products to maximize profitability and ensure you’re maintaining sustainable margins. It will also help you identify which product lines may be killing your profitability. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gross Profit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can arrive at this number by deducting the cost of sales from your business’ net revenue.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Operating Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Expenses are the costs incurred in the daily running of your business – from rent to marketing, training to vehicle mileage. What’s included in operating expenses? The costs can be variable (the cost of labor, materials, supplies, wages), fixed (rent), and accrued (expenses that are incurred but not yet billed for).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Operating Profit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The profit that remains once you’ve deducted selling and administrative costs or expenses.  </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Other Income and Other Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These buckets account for any income or expenses that aren’t related to your company’s main business operations. For example, other income could include royalties, dividends, or gains from the sale of property or other capital assets. Other expenses refer to the costs associated with unexpected losses like repairs or tax penalties.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Profit Before Taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are your company’s profits before paying income tax. Find it on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about each of these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and why they matter. It’s wise to consult an accountant or bookkeeper if you need help with these calculations.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do you fill out a profit and loss statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many freely available P&amp;L statement templates that you can use. Search online or use one of many Microsoft Office templates. You may need to create separate spreadsheets to calculate each of the data points before entering them in your main P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use accounting software like QuickBooks or FreshBooks you can generate a P&amp;L statement in just a few clicks based on your accounting data. </span></p>
<h3><b>How often should you update your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a goal to update your P&amp;L statement frequently. This may be once a month or once per quarter. If your business is new, your update cycle may be more regular. This allows you to keep an eye on profits and satisfy the needs of investors. Updates will also be prompted by tax season, a new product launch, expansion into a new geography, or the emergence of a new competitor on the block (if your profits are dropping you may need to shift your marketing strategy). </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you interpret your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sense of your P&amp;L statement is even more important than maintaining one. If you’re struggling to understand what the numbers are telling you, have a conversation with an accountant. They can help you understand where revenue is being generated, any pitfalls to profitability, and where costs need to be cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online accounting software can also support your analysis. Charts and graphs help you visualize key information. You can also drill down to get a more detailed view into transactions associated with each graphic. These reports can also be easily shared with an accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/financial-indicators-review-accountant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Financial Indicators to Review with Your Accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is the difference between a P&amp;L statement and a balance sheet?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a snapshot of what your business owns (its assets) and what it owes (liabilities).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet won’t inform your profitability or cash flow, however, it is the leading indicator of the overall stability and liquidity of your business and is a useful tool for determining how much cash your business has on hand and your ability to fund growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Do you need to maintain a cash flow statement too?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! It’s critical that you maintain both a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a P&amp;L statement because cash and profitability are two separate indicators. Your cash flow statement provides a detailed picture of where the business’s income comes from and where it goes. If your business shows a profit but maintains a weak cash position, these two statements will give an insight as to why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the process of applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-loan-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you may find yourself in the situation where you need to find a cosigner for the loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what does a cosigner do, how do you find one, and what’s involved? Let’s look at what a business loan cosigner does and the pros and cons of having one.</span></p>
<p><b>What does a cosigner do?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial institutions consider small businesses a high-risk investment due to their lack of credit history and </span><a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/24153946/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2019-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high failure rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As such they may require a cosigner on the loan. It’s a serious obligation. A cosigner doesn’t just cosign your loan, the lender can require them to repay it – and any associated late fees, fines, and penalties – if you default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to helping you secure a loan, using a cosigner may improve your chances of getting a favorable interest rates, flexible repayment terms, or access to more funds. A small business loan cosigner can also mitigate the need for you to put up </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/can-i-get-a-small-business-loan-without-collateral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collateral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as security.</span></p>
<p><b>How to get a cosigner </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cosigner is typically someone with excellent credit history or significant assets (since they may be required to provide collateral such as property, in exchange for financing). Ideally, that individual is someone you trust, such as a family member or friend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosigning services are available from organizations or professionals for a fee but should always be approached with caution and the terms of the services closely scrutinized.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you’ll need to make a compelling case to secure a cosigner. They will want to be confident that you have a well thought out </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/become-an-entrepreneur/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and financial plan, including a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re already an established business, be prepared to share your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet and income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as your P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><b>What is the cosign process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank will advise you whether you should find a cosigner for your small business loan. Once you’ve identified that person, they will complete the loan application process alongside you. Once approved, the cosigner must accept and sign the loan agreement.  </span></p>
<p><b>What are the risks of having a cosigner on your loan?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cosigner doesn’t pose any risks to you or your business. However, if you fail to keep up with loan repayments and the bank calls on your cosigner to pay, then it could seriously damage your relationship – especially if your cosigner is a family member or friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also consider how your cosigner’s credit score might impact your ability to secure a loan, the amount the bank will approve, and the lending terms. </span></p>
<p><b>What to do if you can’t find a cosigner</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosigning is risky and not for everyone. If you’re concerned that your credit score may impact your chances of being approved for a small business loan, there are alternatives to entering into a cosigned loan agreement. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improve your business credit score:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It takes time, but actions such as making timely payments, paying off debt, and maintaining a low credit utilization ratio can help improve your credit score and chances of a successful loan application. For more tips, check out these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-business-credit-score/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Ways to Increase Your Business Credit Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Apply for a business line of credit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works similarly to a credit card and can be used to make purchases for your business, such as stocking up on inventory or paying for marketing programs. Unlike other forms of financing, you don’t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you use.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to a business line of credit quickly and with relatively little administrative work. For example, with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can apply online and get a credit decision in minutes. Unlike a traditional business loan application, you won’t have to complete any paperwork to get started. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there’s no impact to your credit score just for applying.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consider an SBA loan: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a variety of small business loans that are partly guaranteed by the government. This makes them a useful option for small business owners who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for financing. Learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, always consider the pros and cons of having a cosigner on your small business loan. Weigh up other financing options first. If you determine you could benefit from a cosigned loan, apply for a smaller amount, and pay it off diligently. This will help improve your business credit score and boost your chances of getting a business loan the next time you need funds – without the need for collateral or a cosigner. </span></p>

The costs you incur now can help you determine if you need to secure funding, at what point you’ll break even, and where you can realize savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the average cost of starting a business can run into tens of thousands of dollars, many small and microbusinesses – particularly home-based companies – can get started for much less.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed business expenses are precisely that; they remain the same from month to month. These include the overhead of running a business, such as commercial lease payments, mortgage, property taxes, self-employment tax, salaries, loan payments, and business insurance. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculating your average fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you understand how much it costs to operate your business and areas where you can save. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed expenses may be tax deductible. For example, you can generally deduct employee pay, insurance, taxes, interest payments, and rent expenses. In addition, if you have a home office that is used regularly and exclusively for business purposes (the dining room table doesn’t count), you can also deduct the fixed expenses associated by claiming the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/home-office-deduction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home office deduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be sure to consult IRS guidance on </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deducting Business Expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or speak to a business tax advisor.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Variable business expenses</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has expenses that vary from month to month or activity to activity. Variable costs include marketing and advertising, inventory, labor, sales commissions, business mileage, meals and entertainment, gifts, raw materials, maintenance costs, utilities, seasonal hiring, and utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a restaurant, retail business, or niche business, your variable expenses may typically run higher.</span></p>
<h3><b>Overlooked business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always look for tax deductions. You might be surprised at which business expenses the IRS allows business owners to write off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often overlooked expenses include fixed costs like health insurance premiums. If you pay for healthcare insurance entirely out of your pocket using after-tax dollars (no government subsidies or employer share) you should plan for these and may be able to claim a tax deduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other costs that often fly under the radar and are tax deductible include mileage incurred driving to meetings or even to the store to buy office supplies (check the IRS website for the latest standard mileage rate, which changes each year). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variable startup costs like business incorporation fees and the services of a registered agent also play into your budget and are deductible expenses. In addition, if you work with a third-party to help you with legal or accounting matters, you may also write off these expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your cell phone bill a startup expense? Yes, if you use it primarily and exclusively for business. However, if you use your cellphone for personal and business use, the IRS requires you to divide the cost and only claim the business use as a tax deduction.  </span></p>
<h3><b>How to calculate startup costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know the business expenses involved in starting a business. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers many </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/calculate-your-startup-costs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources and tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help with these tasks. These include a </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/breakevenpointcalculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit analysis calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (to calculate your breakeven point), </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/Startup%20Costs%20Worksheet-508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business startup costs calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free business counseling.</span></a></p>
<h3><b>How to track business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking and managing your expenses will help you stay on top of your financial health and prepare for tax season. The first step to doing this is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate your personal and business finances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Having a designated business bank account and credit card makes it much easier to record and track your expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking expenses by spreadsheet is ok, but this method can be hard to scale and maintain accuracy. On the other hand, investing in accounting software and the services of an accountant can help ensure accurate tracking, proper categorization for tax purposes, and report generation. Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/track-business-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to track your small business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has also made it easier to stay on top of the receipts and invoices generated by startup costs. Mobile apps like </span><a href="https://use.expensify.com/expense-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.concur.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/mobile-apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accounting/track-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks Expense Tracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> let you scan your paperwork on the go, import credit card data, import your expenses into your accounting system, and more. </span></p>
<h3><b>How to cut business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a clear picture of your business expenses, find places to cut costs and maximize your profit margin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your quarterly business expense report to identify which expenses are critical and which are not necessary or negotiable. For instance, you may be able to reduce inventory costs by setting up automatic re-orders when inventory gets instead of keeping excess inventory in stock. Also, talk to your cellphone carrier to see if they can offer a cheaper plan based on usage and your number of employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the biggest expenses for a small business? In most cases, these will be labor, benefits, and taxes. Addressing these costs requires a more aggressive approach. But before you reduce headcount, talk to your tax advisor to find out if you’re overpaying on taxes. You could also consult an employee benefits broker to help develop a custom benefits plan that meets your workforce’s needs while staying within your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue to make cuts until you’ve reached your target budget. Here are some </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-cut-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top ways to cut small business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

But this is no time for laggards. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more people working from home, boosting your online presence is critical. Just look at webinars, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/39-of-people-attended-more-webinars-or-webcasts-in-2020-than-in-years-before-301242351.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39% more people attended online events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 than in prior years. And the </span><a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/10/emarketer-us-b2b-digital-ad-spend-soars-226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B business outlook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2021 and 2022 suggests that marketers will continue to accelerate digital growth with search, virtual events, podcasts, and LinkedIn replacing traditional marketing tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many digital channels and brands competing for attention, where should you focus your B2B online marketing strategy and efforts? Here are four areas that you may want to consider as part of your digital marketing mix.</span></p>
<h2>Use online content to inform, engage, and influence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In B2B business marketing, content is king. Sharing valuable and relevant information online such as blogs, videos, infographics, webinars, podcasts, and eBooks, can help inform customers while building trust and engagement. Custom content is so powerful that </span><a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of CMOs view it as the future of marketing. People also feel more positive about a business after reading its shared content. </span><a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content also generates leads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—three-times as much as traditional marketing and at a lower cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any content marketing must be backed up by strategy. Consider your goals. Do you want to drive more traffic to your website, elevate your brand through thought leadership, reach new audiences, or generate leads? Your content should also be informed by your audience and the kind of content they respond to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan your strategy, it’s important to develop content for each stage of the B2B sales funnel—awareness (infographics and blogs), evaluation (white papers, case studies and eBooks), conversion (demos, webinars, and testimonials), loyalty and advocacy (podcasts, blogs, etc.). Finally, have a plan to promote your B2B content through email, social marketing, and earned and paid media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, be prepared to commit time and resources to producing quality content. Prospects and customers respond to better content over more content.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out this blog for more tips on </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/content-marketing-local-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content marketing for local businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Automate your email campaigns</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem old school, but email continues to dominate B2B marketing and is a great way to boost your online efforts.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that 87% of B2B marketers use email to share digital content and nurture and convert leads. And for good reason. Email delivers a captive audience—subscribers have opted in to receive your updates in their inbox. Unlike most social media, you can personalize your messages and measure the response. The ROI is also significant. For every $1 spent on email marketing, business can expect </span><a href="http://emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an average return of $38</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you automate your email campaigns, you can take your business to the next level and convert a prospect to a customer. Any business can map out an email sequence that drives engagement and conversion. For instance, when a prospect subscribes to your email list or fills in a form on your website, start a dialog with them. Your first auto-generated email should introduce your company, describe what makes you unique, and offer a reason why the subscriber should stay engaged (tease them with information about the kind of content and offers you plan to share). Always include a call to action such as schedule an appointment, a free assessment, or something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your second email (automatically sent three-four days later) can dive deeper into the services you offer and the problems you solve. You could point to an online asset like an eBook or white paper that explains how you solve customer pain points. Again, include a call to action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that your subscriber knows a little more about you, focus the final email in the sequence solely on your special offer or promotion and make it time bound. Give your prospects a reason to take action today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t stop there. Automated email campaigns can also be used after a purchase to glean feedback, upsell, cross sell, share content, and keep the engagement going. </span></p>

<h2>Invest in B2B social media marketing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media isn’t just for B2C marketing, it’s a powerful tool for advertising, brand-building, customer engagement, and lead generation. Yet many B2B brands struggle with social media whether through a lack of content, not knowing how to effectively engage with audiences, or what options they have for doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take LinkedIn for example. The platform continues to be the most effective social network for business and accounts for </span><a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/strategy/11-exciting-b2b-marketing-trends-you-need-to-know-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over half of all B2B traffic and 80% of leads,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but LinkedIn has more to offer than its newsfeed. The LinkedIn InMail feature lets brands deliver informative and promotional emails to a targeted list of LinkedIn members. This is a great way to reach new audiences, by job title and industry. Executives can also establish thought leadership through LinkedIn articles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little-known feature of LinkedIn is </span><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This streaming video service lets brands broadcast live content to the platform and attracts a much higher engagement than native broadcasting. Use it to launch new products, spotlight employees, demonstrate expertise, or promote an event. You can also tap the power of your business’ network with </span><a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2020/may/12/tapping-into-the-power-of-your-professional-network-with-polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn Polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a great way to get to know your followers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, LinkedIn has a lot to offer B2B brands, but which social media is best for B2B? Other channels add value too, especially when it comes to branding. To help you decide, look at what your competitors are doing. If they’re having success on Twitter or YouTube, then you can too.  </span></p>
<h2>Enhance your SEO efforts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization (SEO) can seem like a daunting practice but it’s invaluable for promoting your B2B business online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done well, SEO ensures your website has a strong search ranking. The higher you rank on Google and Bing, the more traffic your website will receive. It can be tempting to invest in paid SEO (where you pay when someone clicks on your ad next to a search result), but organic search could generate better dividends. For every click on a paid search result, </span><a href="https://moz.com/blog/via-enquisite-ppc-agencies-make-45x-what-seos-do-for-the-same-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organic search generates 8.5 clicks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key to this conversion rate is content. High quality, long-form content (which creates more opportunity for the inclusion of key words) is ranked higher by search engines. Informative website product copy sprinkled with keywords and phrases can also help you rank better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfecting SEO takes time, but as you produce more content and other sites link to that content (known as back linking) your ranking and site traffic will increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to SEO, here are some useful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tips for increasing B2B SEO traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

The period for filing federal tax returns was </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/2021-tax-filing-season-begins-feb-12-irs-outlines-steps-to-speed-refunds-during-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to February 12, 2021 to allow the IRS to test its systems following pandemic-related changes to tax law. Argh, pressure! But wait. In March, the IRS announced it was </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extending Tax Day for individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including those who pay self-employment tax) to May 17, 2021. Phew!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, questions still abound about stimulus checks, PPP loan forgiveness, when refunds will be issued, and more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you prepare your small business tax return, we answer your pressing 2020 tax season questions.</span></p>
<h2>What is the last date for filing your 2020 tax return?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated above, you must file your 2020 taxes by May 17, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even with this extended deadline, it’s wise to file your federal income tax return as soon as possible, especially if you’re owed a refund. Most refunds are issued within 21 days if you file electronically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need additional time, you can request a filing extension until October 15, 2021 by filing </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-4868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 4868</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (although this does not grant an extension of the time you have to pay any due taxes). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the filing extension only applies to federal returns. You are still required to file your state tax return on time. This is a fluid situation, so check with your state to see if they plan to extend their filing deadlines too.</span></p>
<h2>How can I calculate my tax refund?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t prepared your taxes yet, most tax filing companies offer a tax return calculator. There’s </span><a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TaxCaster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from TurboTax, H&amp;R Block’s </span><a href="https://www.hrblock.com/tax-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income Tax Calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, NerdWallet’s </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/taxes/tax-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Income Tax Calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more. You don’t need to subscribe to their tax service to use each of these tools, just enter a few details about your income, expenses, and so on for an estimate.</span></p>
<h2>Where’s my refund?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you qualify for a refund for taxes paid in 2020 you can track your IRS refund status via the IRS’ </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/refunds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s My Refund?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool. This information is typically available 24-48 hours after the IRS accepted your electronic filing. Enter your Social Security number or ITIN, filing status, and exact refund amount for an update. Refunds are usually approved in about two business days and refunds issued approximately 20 days later.</span></p>
<h2>When will I get a stimulus check?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulus checks are un-related to your tax refund, but if you are eligible for the third round of payments under the $1.9 trillion relief package you can </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">track the status of your stimulus payment with the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Payments will be based on your 2019 federal tax return. You should be able to check your eligibility, payment status, and whether you’ll receive it electronically or in the mail.</span></p>
<h2>I received a PPP loan, how does that impact my tax return?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan under pandemic-response legislation in 2020 to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, it’s important to understand whether you owe taxes on your loan. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>PPP loan forgiveness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP loans may be forgiven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning they are essentially grants, but only if at least 60% of the loan was spent on paying employees a normal salary for 8-24 weeks after the loan was approved. The remaining 40% could be spent on expenses such as mortgage interest, rent, operating costs, and more (although they can’t be used to pay business taxes). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>How to apply for PPP loan forgiveness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: To get forgiveness, businesses must complete a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and file it with their lender. Employers may also be eligible for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">partial</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forgiveness, for instance if salaries decreased slightly or the number of full-time employees on payroll declined somewhat.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>PPP loans and your taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Importantly, if a PPP loan is forgiven it is not considered taxable income and is tax-exempt. Furthermore, any expenses paid for using the loan can also be written off as regular business expenses in your tax return.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you better understand the tax implications associated with PPP loans, read: </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Does a PPP Loan Affect Your Taxes?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if you’re looking for extra funds for your business and are curious about PPP loans, know that sole proprietors and independent contractors now qualify. Yes, indeed. Don’t let the “paycheck” in the name fool you into thinking you wouldn’t qualify for this forgivable loan. In fact, since you don’t have staff headcount, payroll, and benefits to calculate, your application process (for the loan and later for forgiveness) should be much simpler. </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how much you can borrow, what you can spend your PPP loan on, and what you’ll need to apply.</span></p>
<h2>Is it too late to file 2019 taxes?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deadline for filing 2019 taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was July 15, 2020 (postponed from April 15 due to the pandemic). Automatic extensions were available through October 15, 2020 for those unable to file by the earlier deadline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the IRS has yet to process than 2.4 million individual income tax returns for 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re among this number, keep checking the status of your refund using the IRS’ </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s My Refund?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool. If you are eligible for a refund on your 2019 taxes, you have until July 15, 2023 to claim it. </span></p>

But what’s the best basis for doing so—especially if one partner contributes more work hours, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invests more money into the business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or even sets up your </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you need to know to plan your profit-sharing strategy in a small business partnership, plus some other steps you can take to make that partnership airtight.</span></p>
<h2>Formally structure your small business</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you make any decisions about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-reasons-change-ownership-shares-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">splitting profits</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with your business partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a partnership contract for your small business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, talk to a lawyer about the best way to legally </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">structure your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to go from a sole proprietorship model to a partnership model, here are a few business structure options for you to consider.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Two of these are general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. Let’s look at both.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Partnerships:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simplest route is to form a “general partnership”, simply register your “doing business as (DBA)” name and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open a bank account in the business’ name</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This structure assumes that all profits, liability, and management duties are equally divided among the partners. If the partnership is unequal, such as a 30-70 ratio, then you’d need to document the percentages assigned to each partner in the partnership agreement (more on that later).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Liability Partnerships:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is a “limited liability partnership” also known as an LLP. Professional partners, such as lawyers or accountants, are often advised to go this route since it protects the business owners from personal liability for the debts or liabilities incurred by the partnership. For example, if you run into a cash flow issue and your business fails, neither partner will be personally liable for any debts owed to creditors. Another option is a “limited partnership (LP)” in which one partner invests in the business but doesn’t manage it, leaving that task to one or more of the other partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research these options to understand which makes more sense for you. You may want to ask your financial advisor or lawyer for advice about this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially when it comes time to register your business as a chosen entity, such as an </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/preparing-s-corp-deadline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">s-corp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2>Decide how you’ll split profits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a business partnership, you can split the profits any way you want, under one condition—all business partners must be in agreement about profit-sharing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can choose to split the profits equally, or each partner can receive a different base salary and then the partners will split any remaining profits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you choose to structure your profit-sharing agreement will be up to the business partners to decide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, in an equal partnership (50-50) neither partner can make a decision without the other’s approval, whereas in a 51-49 ratio, for example, one partner has final authority. (Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/setting-your-salary-as-a-business-owner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting your salary as a business owner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know ahead of time that one or more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partners </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will only play a minor role in income generating activities, you might agree to pay the more active partner a higher salary. Another </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">option you have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to pay partners only for work performed based on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predetermined</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rates for certain projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, it’s a good idea to create a profit-sharing agreement and make it part of your larger partnership agreement. All partners should agree and sign, to prevent problems later.</span></p>
<h2>Put everything in writing with a partnership agreement</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A partnership agreement is the business version of a prenuptial agreement and should be completed before you start operations and any profits are made (the division of profits is a critical part of this process). Although an agreement is not legally required, it can protect your interests as one half of the partnership for the duration of your partnership and through its dissolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to include in the agreement include the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Division of profits</strong>. This includes both the division of profits and losses and how and when each partner will get paid.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Contributions to the partnership</strong>. If either partner contributes any assets to the business, whether it’s cash, property, or equipment, you’ll need to ensure these are documented.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Business decision-making</strong>. What authority does each partner have to make business decisions? How will you handle disputes? How will you handle the dissolution of the partnership when that time comes?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Who does what</strong>. Divide up your management duties and document them in the agreement. For example, who handles </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/diy-public-relations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">media relations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/simplify-small-business-payroll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payroll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work with a lawyer and your accountant to develop and formalize the agreement, there are many factors that require consideration when forming any kind of partnership and getting legal and financial advice now will save you a lot of hassle in the long run. If you don’t have an accountant yet, check out our guide: </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/find-right-accountant-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Find the Right Accountant for Your Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Revisit the agreement annually</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it: business dynamics and personal relationships change. If your partnership has evolved over the past year or is likely to change in the coming year, it’s important that you revisit your partnership or profit-sharing agreement to reflect these subtleties. If you need to change your agreement drastically, consider bringing in the services of your lawyer or accountant to make sure everything is correctly documented.</span></p>
<h2>Understand how business partnerships are taxed</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you structure your profit-sharing agreement, you’ll also need to be aware of how the IRS taxes partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a partnership, the business “passes through” any profits or losses to its partners. Partners include their respective share of the partnership’s income or loss on their personal tax returns. Partnerships do, however, need to file an annual </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">information return</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Form 1065), also known as a “Partnership Tax Return” to report income, deductions, gains, losses, and more with the IRS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partners are not employees and should not be issued a Form W-2. The partnership must provide copies of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to each partner showing their respective share of profits for the year by the date Form 1065 is required to be filed, including extensions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/partnerships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnerships tax obligations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on IRS.gov.</span></p>
<h2>Plan for a happy and profitable partnership</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting yourself before you start a business partnership is your best strategy for ensuring the union is a happy one. To make sure you’re both getting the most out of this partnership, you’ll want to come to terms on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit-sharing. Let’s look at a few common profit-sharing questions for more insight into this important aspect of a partnership. </span></p>
<h2>What is profit-sharing in a business?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you decide to split your profits depends on your small business partnership agreement. When creating your partnership agreement, all the partners in the business need to agree on how to share profits. You may choose to share the profits equally or you may decide to pay each partner a set salary and then divvy up any remaining profits in a certain type of way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you form an equal partnership (50-50) between two people, you will both need to make decisions regarding profit-sharing together and will need each partner’s approval to make these decisions. However, if you have an uneven partnership ratio, the partner with the majority share in the business will get to make the final decision regarding profit-sharing and salaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how you choose to divide up your profits, you’ll need to create a profit-sharing agreement that is a part of your overall partnership agreement and all partners need to approve of and sign the profit-sharing agreement in order to make sure everyone is on the same page. In this partnership, you’ll also want to put into writing how you will divide any losses. </span></p>
<h2>What is a good profit-sharing percentage?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no one clear answer for what a good profit-sharing percentage is for all businesses. How many partners you have, how much work each partner does, the experience they bring to the table, and how much money each partner has invested in the business will likely play a factor in how you split up profits. While an equal 50-50 partnership may work for a business with two partners who are equally involved, other partnerships may not be built on such equal footing and may require that one partner receives more profits. </span></p>
<h2>Who is eligible for profit-sharing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is eligible for profit-sharing will depend on your profit-sharing and partnership agreements. Working with a lawyer and accountant to develop a profit-sharing agreement will help ensure that everyone knows exactly what their role in the business is and how that relates to their profits. You want to have a legal agreement in place to help avoid any confusion and disagreements from popping up in the future.</span></p>
<h2>What are the disadvantages of profit-sharing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most obvious disadvantage of profit-sharing is that you have to share your profits. While sharing your profits with business partners may work well for a while, the profit-sharing agreement business partners originally put in place may not feel appropriate over time as the business evolves and changes. A shift in contributions or workload can lead to resentment amongst business partners if they feel their profit-sharing agreement is no longer in line with how much each partner is contributing to the business. In many cases, a profit-sharing agreement can work well and never need to be changed, but it is also a possibility that changes may need to occur over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why it’s a good idea to reevaluate your profit-sharing agreement from time to time. You may want to agree upfront to reevaluate your profit-sharing agreement annually in order to reflect on changes that occurred throughout the year. Working with your lawyer or accountant can be helpful if you need to change your agreement substantially, as they can make sure these important changes are documented properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any doubts about whether a partnership is right for you, read these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 Questions to Ask Before Entering into a Business Partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Profit sharing is an important consideration but there are many moving parts to a business that you should consider and include in your partnership agreement.

<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that email is a top distribution channel for both B2B and B2C marketers. In the last 12 months, 87% of B2B and 79% of B2C marketers have turned to email to share content, nurture leads, and convert leads to sales. Email has also evolved into an important multi-generational channel. Perhaps surprisingly, </span><a href="https://content.myemma.com/blog/7-statistics-that-prove-email-marketing-works-for-younger-demographics#:~:text=Millennials%20spend%206.4%20hours%20a%20day%20checking%20email.&amp;text=Adobe's%20recent%20study%20found%20that,or%20even%20using%20the%20bathroom." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millennials spend 6.4 hours a day checking email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are 63% more likely to be swayed by promotional email.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of email marketing? Here are a few reasons to maintain an active email marketing strategy: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your audience has opted in. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">They want to see you in their inbox (rather than take the chance of catching you on social media’s busy newsfeeds).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>You can personalize your message</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a high degree of specificity based on demographics, purchase history, interests, and more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Unlike social media, email is easily measurable.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Open rates, click through rates, unsubscribes, etc. are all a great way to gauge whether your email marketing is a success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>It’s cost-effective</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-do-you-calculate-email-marketing-roi/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20customer,Holy%20Grail%20of%20marketing%20communication.&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20ROI%20for,on%20an%20email%20marketing%20campaign." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ROI for email is as high as 4400%,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or $44 for every dollar spent on an email campaign.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as email volumes grow </span><a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/email-open-rates/#:~:text=Until%202019%2C%20that%20is.,slight%20decrease%20compared%20to%202019)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open rates are on the decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, the average open rate dropped to 21% compared to a steady 24% between 2015 and 2018. This means that standing out from the crowd is getting harder than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re struggling to turn your prospects into email subscribers or your email just isn’t performing as you’d like, read on to discover four common email mistakes you might be making and how they can be avoided.</span></p>
<h3>1. You don’t have a welcome email</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many times have you signed up to receive email updates or a newsletter from a company and felt like your subscription doesn’t matter to them? According to Campaign Monitor, a staggering </span><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/01/7-welcome-email-dos-and-donts-for-stellar-results/#:~:text=Frankly%2C%20you're%20never%20going,customers%20or%20potential%20customers%20subscribe." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% of brands don’t automatically send a welcome email</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to new customers or prospects. This is a huge email marketing mistake because </span><a href="https://keap.com/business-success-blog/marketing/email-marketing/how-and-when-to-send-welcome-emails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subscribers are the most engaged brands within the first 48 hours of signing-up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A welcome email is your first opportunity to form a relationship with your subscriber. It also sets the tone for what they can expect from future communications from your company. And, it’s a great opportunity to make a sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you craft your welcome email, keep your messaging simple and conversational. Thank the subscriber for making you a part of their lives and welcome them to your community. Communicate what they can expect for being a subscriber such as access to the latest news, product releases, special offers, ways to get involved, etc. Offer them a discount in exchange for more information, such as registering with your company or completing a profile (you’ll need this so that you can get to know them better and tailor future emails). Finally, make that call to action clear. Don’t bury it in a ton of copy and use graphics to guide the eye towards it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most email platforms like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, and Emma include ready-to-use email campaign templates to simplify the process.</span></p>
<h3>2. You’re not personalizing your emails</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As humans we crave personalized experiences. It helps us separate one brand experience from another and drives a deeper connection. According to HubSpot, </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized emails have a 26% higher open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and an improved click-through rate compared to others. But if your email marketing personalization only extends to including your customer’s first name in the communications you send them, you’re missing out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True personalization is about getting to know your customers likes, needs, and wants and adding that personal touch to each email. There are many ways to personalize your emails. You can use demographic data such as birth dates, location, interests, and gender to tailor your subject lines, body copy, and offers. As you build a relationship with the customer, you can further personalize content based on browsing and purchase history. For instance, you might recommend products or services that are complimentary to an item they’ve purchased in the past. You can also use personalization to send content that is relevant to where your leads are in the sales funnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever your approach, find ways to drive consistent personalization across the customer journey. The more data you accumulate about each customer, the more opportunities you’ll find to engage with them in a thoughtful way–while driving greater conversions.</span></p>
<h3>3. You’re not testing which content work best</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not testing which emails perform the best, it’s hard to know which of your email campaigns is the most successful and why. Tracking clicks, open rates, and conversions is important, but you also need to figure out what your audience likes and responds to–before you launch a full-blown campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where A/B testing comes into play. A/B testing compares the performance of two or more unique versions of the same email among a sample audience. With A/B testing you can test any number of variables. For instance, which subject line performs better? Does an offer or call to action receive more clicks if it’s positioned at the top of the email versus at the bottom? Is one time of the day better for delivery?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most email providers have platforms that offer some form of testing built in. During a test you’ll set up several versions of the same email–A, B and even C–and send then the system will send them to random, small subsets of your email list. All this happens well before you send out your main blast. Once the results are in, review the metrics for your test.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’ve determined the best performing content/format/timing, or whatever, you can run with that version of your email.</span></p>
<h3>4. You’re not automating your email campaigns</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email automation has come a long way since its early days when we used it to personalize emails and plan drip email campaigns. Today’s email marketing platforms make it easy to create an email sequence that is highly automated, triggering a series of emails based on the customer’s actions. This automation can be used to start a conversation, nurture customers, and even win customers back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fundbox customer, digital marketing consultant, and founder of </span><a href="http://geekpoweredstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geek Powered Studios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Guillermo Ortiz, uses email automation to get customer feedback. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses a review tool that automatically sends a customer an email when they are added to the business’ email list. The email asks them to rate their experience. Anything rated seven or above triggers an email to the client asking them to leave a review online. Any poor ratings go straight to the business owner, so that they can address the issue right away, before an upset customer leaves a negative review online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email had a significant impact. Now approximately 10% of customers leave a review. Considering that Google ranks businesses based on the number of reviews they have it can have a big effect. Positive reviews also make a good impression on prospective customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortiz’s blog post–</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earn More Sales with Email Marketing Automation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">–explains how to build a simple email automation sequence.  </span></p>

According to Capital One’s latest</span><a href="https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/small-business-growth-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Small Business Growth Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.capitalone.com/small-business/credit-cards/small-business-growth-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">64 percent of businesses view conditions as “good or excellent.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimism aside, many businesses find their growth plans thwarted at every turn. Surprisingly, one of the biggest impediments to growth is the business itself. Many businesses simply aren’t operationally ready for growth because a lack of skilled labor, poor hiring decisions, a lack of competitive intelligence, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you make your small business grow faster? What impacts the growth of small businesses? How do you finance growth?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a round-up of some of the most common barriers to growth and steps you can take to break through them as you look to capitalize on key </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/2021-small-business-trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business trends for 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<h2>1. Ignoring Business Indicators</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone wants revenue growth, but what form will it take and are you ready to grow in that area? Study your business indicators regularly to monitor growth opportunities. This includes your sales pipeline, conversion rates, and market trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to look out for include success in one market or location and the potential to expand into another. Is a big sales deal on the horizon? Is your pipeline trending favorably? Is success in one area of product development opening new doors of opportunity for others?</span></p>
<h2>2. Overlooking the Competition</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition can be a great driver for growth if you approach it correctly. There’s no point making it your mission to be better than the competition if you don’t have a deep knowledge of where you stand against them. A powerful tool for doing this is a simple </span><a href="https://www.score.org/resource/swot-analysis-worksheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT stands for “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.” A SWOT analysis can help you identify what’s working and what isn’t, and where to concentrate your energies.</span></p>
<h2>3. Forgetting About People Until It’s Too Late</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite record high unemployment rates, a lack of skills and abilities remains a major concern. Today, </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/businesses-continue-to-struggle-to-find-qualified-talent-despite-millions-of-individuals-looking-to-re-enter-the-workforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent of organizations report that they have been negatively impacted by talent scarcity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To grow you need to surround yourself with great people. Always be on the lookout for talent. Build a stable of independent contractors who can get to know your business well and contribute on an as-needed basis. Once you’re ready to grow they can step in with minimal ramp-up and help you meet your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option comes in the form of mentors. Having someone beside you who’s been there before as you enter new territory can be invaluable. </span></p>
<h2>4. Not Accounting for Risk Early in the Growth Phase</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business growth doesn’t come without risk. As you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/create-a-business-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan your growth strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have a “Plan B” in place that accounts for any hurdles along the way that might impede growth. Things like hiring problems, manufacturing issues, unexpected expenses, cash flow challenges, patent infringements, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go back to your SWOT analysis and identify these risks or threats and think about ways you can fix or get around them. These are also good conversations to have with your mentor as well as your accountant and/or lawyer.</span></p>
<h2>5. Failing to Plan for Cash Flow Issues</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With growth comes extra cost. If your outgoings are more than your income, even for a short period, paying your bills gets difficult. In fact, cash flow issues are one of the </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most common reasons why small businesses fail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/5-ways-to-fix-common-cash-flow-problems-before-its-too-late" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close their doors for this reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To preserve cash flow while growing your business, you may need access to funding. But take time to consider which loan types make sense for you because not all are created equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you’re looking to fund expansion or need an injection of cash during unpredictable operating cycles you may want to explore a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can get set up a line of credit before you need it and only pay for the funds you use. Lines of credit are revolving, and monthly payments don’t kick in until you dip into the cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is a term loan. This gives you access to a set amount of money with a specific repayment schedule. Term loans often have low interest rates and provides the funding for small business growth initiatives such as opening a new location, upgrading equipment, purchasing vehicles, or remodeling your space. With a term loan funding your growth you can preserve your cash flow for other areas of your business such as payroll. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as workers transition from employment to freelance life, they face many challenges – key among them is cash flow. </span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FreshBooks-Finance-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that 35% of freelancers struggle significantly with money and 25% of freelance businesses under two years old regularly face cash flow challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key issue for freelancers is that many of the tactics available to other small businesses to improve cash flow – such as raising prices or moving inventory – don’t work for them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a freelancer, here are six strategies that you can practice to improve and manage your cash flow.</span></p>
<h2>Use your contracts wisely</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first tool in your arsenal is your client contract. Whether you have your own contract or are asked to agree to your client’s contract – pay attention to the language and terms. If you have a problem with anything, such as how frequently you can invoice and payment terms, speak up. Now is when you have the most leverage. Your client is eager to start the project and may be willing to make some tweaks to accommodate your demands. You may also want to build in other items such as kill fees, late fees, milestone payments, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill is to avoid any ambiguity in the contract so that both parties are clear about what’s expected and what should happen if the contract is cancelled, you are paid late, or scope creep is introduced to the engagement.</span></p>
<h2>Practice invoice hygiene</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big reason for cash flow woes among freelancers is not getting paid on time. Most clients have payment terms of 30, 45, or even 60-days. In addition, many clients still pay by check which can easily add another week to the process. A </span><a href="https://www.bill.com/about-us/press-release/billcom-survey-reveals-gig-economy-workers-prefer-clients-use-digital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Bill.com found that 54% of freelancers say it takes too long to get their money and 45% say clients don’t pay them on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help mitigate the risk of late payments, invoice promptly and accurately. If you can, don’t wait until the end of the month. Either bill your clients once the project is complete or invoice twice monthly (if your contract permits it). Always include as much detail as you can on your invoice so that there’s no push back or delays. Detail the hours you worked, your hourly rate, a PO number if issued, project specifics, and your client point of contact so that accounts payable knows who to turn to for approvals. Most importantly, include your payment terms. This will give you extra leverage to chase late payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, keep a spreadsheet showing all submitted invoices. Record the date, invoice number, client, amount, and project specifics and if payment has been received. Check your spreadsheet regularly and chase any amounts that are past due.</span></p>
<h2>Set money aside for your estimated taxes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated taxes are paid quarterly to the federal and state government. Yet many new freelancers aren’t aware that they are required to make these payments as they go and are caught with a hefty tax bill at the end of the year. Even seasoned freelancers can get caught out if they don’t plan for those quarterly payments and find themselves with an unexpected cash flow crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most efficient way to avoid both scenarios is to save as you go. Instead of pocketing your earnings and spending it all, consider opening a separate bank account and depositing 30-35% of your revenue each month or on a schedule that works for you. You can then draw on this cash to pay your estimated taxes without feeling the pinch.</span></p>
<h2>Consider forming an S Corporation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most freelancers operate as sole proprietorships, and, while the administrative burden may be minimal, the tax obligation can be significant. Sole proprietors pay 100% of their self-employment taxes and are taxed on all profits of the business, less deductible expenses – this can put a huge strain on your cash resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming your business as a limited liability company (LLC) and </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electing to become an S corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the eyes of the IRS could help you realize savings. When structured as an S corporation, as the business owner, you are treated as an employee and draw a salary from the profits of your business. In this scenario, only your wages are subject to self-employment tax. The remaining profits are then distributed to you as dividends on which you pay personal income tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An S corporation is not right for every freelancer. It all really depends on your income level, the tax bracket you occupy, and willingness to deal with the additional paperwork and state fees. You may also need to retain the services of a tax advisor or accountant to help you meet all your administrative responsibilities. Talk to a pro before you make the leap.     </span></p>
<h2>Reduce your tax burden with an SEP retirement plan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to reduce your taxable income, preserve cash, and plan for your future is to open a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plan or SEP-IRA. Unlike a traditional IRA, a SEP lets you contribute more to the plan each year – up to 25% of your total income or $57,000 (refer to the IRS for the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-seps-contributions#:~:text=How%20much%20can%20I%20contribute,living%20adjustments%20for%20later%20years)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest contribution limits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Compare that to the current IRA limit of $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great benefit of a SEP is that you can vary your contributions for the tax year up until tax-day. If you have a profitable month, go ahead and put more money into your SEP (as long as you don’t go over the limit). Plus, all those contributions are tax deductible – potentially helping your cash flow situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A SEP is first and foremost a retirement strategy but it’s also a great fit for freelancers concerned about cash on hand.</span></p>
<h2>Use a line of credit as your safety net</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every freelancer needs a safety net. But if you don’t have enough savings to tide you over when cash flow is tight, consider applying for a business line of credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a useful tool that can help freelancers overcome cash flow gaps without the complications that come with a more traditional bank loan. You can borrow a pre-agreed amount of money from a financial institution when you need it and repay back when you don’t. For example, with </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fundbox</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> you can apply online</strong> and get a decision in minutes. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there’s no impact to your credit score just for applying.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also don’t have to use the money right away you can simply have the line of credit on hand as a safety net for when unexpected cash flow issues arise. Unlike a business loan you can also use the funds for any purpose – paying bills, marketing, and so on. </span></p>
<h2>Always have an eye on cash flow</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re busy, you wear many hats, clients are asking for more and more – but remember cash is king. Don’t wait until the tough times arrive to start worrying about cash flow. With careful planning you can offset the common cash flow pitfalls of being a freelancer and be more comfortable and successful for it. </span></p>
