Did you catch them?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Female entrepreneurs are still not getting enough access to capital.</span></h2>
<p>While the National Association of Women Business Owners holds its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.nawbo.org/2018-wbc-agenda">2018 National Women&#8217;s Business Conference</a></span> this week, a recent piece in The Hill by Bonnie Nawara (who is the board chair and interim president/CEO of the Association of Women’s Business Centers and runs a Women’s Business Center in Grand Rapids, Michigan) laments the lack of capital available to women entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;While today’s landscape is more embracing of women, systemic gender bias and discrimination still exist, which makes starting and growing a business difficult,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;Research indicates that women start businesses with roughly half as much capital as their male counterparts; they receive just 2 percent of venture capital funds and less than 5 percent of conventional business loan dollars.&#8221; (Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/finance/403018-with-a-little-help-female-entrepreneurs-can-breakout">The Hill</a></span>)</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h2>
<p>Nawara suggests that Congress should continue to provide funding for organizations that support female entrepreneurs and consider offering additional tax breaks and other incentives to venture capital firms &#8220;that achieve parity in funding levels for male- and female-led ventures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her suggestions are right on point and while we&#8217;re at it, Congress should also consider similar breaks for other minority entrepreneurs who are also lagging far behind in getting access to capital. The playing field is not level and the opportunities to create jobs, expand the economy and provide livelihoods for struggling communities could be significant if women and minority business owners can get their hands on more funds.</p>
<h2>2. Small-business borrowers are on the verge of consumer-style protections in CA<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></h2>
<p>California is about to enact the nation’s first law requiring lenders to disclose interest rates in a way that enables small-business borrowers to compare multiple offers. This is in reaction to these business owners’ ongoing complaints that many high-cost loans from online lenders have misleading terms and put an unsustainable strain on their finances. The legislation, which would extend consumer-like borrower protections to small businesses, is designed to increase the transparency of financial products marketed to small firms. (Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/small-business-borrowers-on-verge-of-consumer-style-protections-in-calif">American Banker</a></span>)</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h2>
<p>Let’s not fool ourselves, fellow small business owners: many of our businesses are…well…small. In fact, the great majority of the 30 million small business owners in this country only employ one person: themselves. So in effect, are we pretty much the same as a consumer and should we not be able to able to take advantage of some of the more important consumer credit protections? We’re not big enough to employ Chief Financial Officers, in-house attorneys or financing experts, so the more help we can get to protect ourselves, the better. Hopefully this move in California will be emulated across the country.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3</span>. S<span style="font-weight: bold;">mall Business Index shows access to capital is strong amid record high optimism</span></h2>
<p>The end-of-August Q3 MetLife &amp; U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index showed that nearly 70 percent of small business owners feel positive about their company and America’s small business environment. In the midst of this general optimism, access to capital is strong. However, it differs across all small businesses, with 23 percent of small businesses reporting that it is hard to obtain financing. (Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/small-business-index-shows-access-to-capital-is-strong-amid-record-high-optimism-1027494049">Business Insider</a></span>)</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;After the 2008 financial crisis there was a decline in small businesses&#8217; access to capital. Recently, Congress took steps to make it easier for small businesses to get capital,&#8221; Tom Sullivan, U.S. Chamber vice president of small business policy said. &#8220;We are moving in the right direction, but more policies that ease small businesses&#8217; access to financing need to occur to ensure this vital sector of our economy continues to grow, create jobs, and positively impact communities across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Access to capital is certainly a lot easier than it was ten years ago (although not as easy for women and minorities as I write above) and even very small businesses with little financial history can get financing from online vendors and other sources…as long as they’re willing to pay the price of much higher interest rates.</p>
<h2>4. IRS targets a potential tax break loophole</h2>
<p>The IRS has proposed regulations that say it’s abusive for professional service providers such as law and accounting firms to use loopholes to take advantage of the 20 percent deduction in the new tax law. These firms have been using strategies such as splitting their businesses into different entities or combining multiple businesses into one to get around income limits set for pass-through businesses under the new tax law. (Source: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.accountingtoday.com/articles/irs-targets-loopholes-for-415b-pass-through-business-owner-tax-break">Accounting Today</a></span>)</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h2>
<p>People call it “crack and pack” (not kidding), but don’t fall for that scheme. If you are a service business, meaning a &#8220;trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, investing and investment management, trading, dealing in certain assets or any trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees&#8221; (as very recently defined by the IRS), then you better be careful about splitting up your business to avoid the limitation on the pass-through deduction. Any companies with &#8220;common connections&#8221; would be treated as one entity for purposes of this deduction.</p>

Did you catch them?</em></p>
<h2>1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You’re less likely to be audited this year.</span></h2>
<p>Due to budget cuts that have reduced its staff by about a third since 2010, the Internal Revenue Service can’t perform as many audits as it used to. In fact, in 2017, the IRS audited only 1 in about 160 individual tax returns—the lowest number since 2002 and the sixth consecutive year that audits have declined. At its peak 8 years ago, the IRS audited 1 in 90 individual returns. The audit rate last year declined the most for high-income households, although they were still audited at a higher rate than taxpayers with lower incomes. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-irs-is-auditing-a-lot-fewer-americans-1522315800">Wall Street Journal</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">)</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9136" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Data-less-audit-scrutiny.png" alt="Data: Less audit scrutiny (Source: WSJ)" width="735" height="515" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h3>
<p>Does this mean it’s OK to start cheating on your taxes? Of course not!</p>
<p>For starters, an audit shouldn’t be the reason why you comply with the law. You comply with the law because it’s the law and it’s the right thing to do. If you’re running a reputable business then this shouldn’t even be a consideration. And sure, the chances of your audit have decreased. But in today’s world, it’s very easy for disgruntled former and current employees or even outsiders to act as whistleblowers if they see you doing something wrong. Once you’ve been flagged, you’ve got trouble.</p>
<p>What kind of trouble? Plenty. An audit is a time-consuming and very costly process that, if anything bad comes of it, could not only ruin your reputation in your community but potentially put you out of business. I know many of my clients who bend the tax law and personally I’m not sure how they sleep soundly at night knowing just how precarious their livelihood is if anyone were to find out. The bottom line: don’t worry about the chances of being audited by the IRS. Just obey the law.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. One small bank is increasing its lending thanks to technology. </span></h2>
<p>Since it competes with several larger regional banks in Ooltewah, Tennessee, Millennium Bank knew it had to find a creative way to attract and retain borrowers. About three years ago, its management team decided that, to do that, it had to speed up loan delivery. Unfortunately, its credit analysis process was highly manual and didn’t accommodate quick turnaround on loans. The solution was to upgrade its technology to improve its ability to analyze loans and speed up decision-making. To accomplish this, the bank brought in new software designed specifically to improve the lending process. Now, it can fund loans within hours or even minutes. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/how-millennium-bank-upped-its-lending-without-hiring-more-lenders">American Banker</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Takeaway:</span></h3>
<p>Ever paid for something in Europe? Or even lived there for a few months? If you have, then I’m sure you’ll agree that the U.S. banking system is still operating in the dark ages. The fact that many of us still use paper checks boggles the mind of many of our European friends!  There are many reasons why this is the case – the country’s size, the difficulty of change, the complexity of our systems. But customers – particularly millennials in their 20’s and 30’s &#8211; don’t want to hear that. They want to hear fast. They want to hear yes. They want to hear now.</p>
<p>Millennium Bank is doing what many smaller banks are doing to compete. They’re investing in technology to enable their customers that significantly reduces manual document entry and turns the loan approval processes into an online and mobile experience that delivers answers – and cash – quickly. It’s not just a customer service issue – it’s an operational one. With the right internal software, errors can be reduced and productivity increased. “We’ve seen our loan growth increase pretty well without adding any headcount,” John Hatfield, credit officer at the $139 million-asset bank, said to American Banker.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure that bank branches will be completely eliminated in the years to come. But there’s no question that today’s customers are demanding many of the services provided by their branch to be delivered faster. If you’re a smaller financial institution this type of investment will be critical to your survival.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Amazon wants to get to teenagers before the banks do.</span></h2>
<p>The one age group that’s been a challenge for Amazon’s marketing team is teenagers, also known as ‘Generation Z’, because they don’t have bank accounts or debit/credit cards and prefer shopping at brick-and-mortar stores rather than online. But now Amazon is talking to large banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts that appeals to young people and others without credit cards. If Amazon can deliver a better banking experience for these digitally savvy youngsters, it could start taking lifelong banking customers away from banks of all sizes. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Source: </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/amazon-s-next-challenge-teens-without-the-plastic-to-buy-online">Bloomberg</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">)</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9135" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Data-Banking-with-Amazon.png" alt="Data: Consumers open to banking with Amazon (via Bloomberg)" width="601" height="385" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Takeaway:</span></h3>
<p>Don’t be so shocked – retailing is a great place to do your banking and Amazon is only doing what smart companies do: it looks to build a lifelong relationship with its customer so that they keep coming back to the online giant for just about anything needed. This is why the company, according to the Bloomberg article, “offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.”</p>
<p>So what better way to solidify a relationship than to offer banking services? People need credit and credit cards. Loan services. Most of these services can be performed online right now and the demand is almost guaranteed grow as younger generations look for an easier way to manage their money and new types of payments like digital currencies become more mainstream.</p>
<p>By the way – Amazon, isn’t the only retailer trying this. Both Sam’s Club and Walmart offer banking services to their customers and others are testing the waters. They get it: there’s a new generation of customers quickly moving to the fore, and these kids want convenience.</p>
