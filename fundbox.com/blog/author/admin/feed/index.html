<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Fundbox Stripe App, Stripe business customers now have even faster, easier access to working capital directly through Stripe via the company’s new Stripe App Marketplace. Stripe, a financial infrastructure platform for businesses, works with millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities.</span></p>
<h2><b>How the Fundbox Stripe App helps small businesses </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of industry, it’s not uncommon for small businesses to experience cash flow challenges. Many small businesses find themselves with large amounts of capital tied up in outstanding receivables. With </span><a href="https://fintechcircle.com/insights/unlocking-capital-stuck-in-accounts-receivable-through-netting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$14 trillion</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of capital stuck in payables and receivables, many businesses need access to funds to manage and grow their businesses. With a Fundbox Line of Credit, business owners get fast, easy access to the working capital and flexible payments solutions they need to optimize their cash flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers embedded finance solutions through a number of partners, giving even more businesses access to the working capital they need within the tools they already use. With the Fundbox Stripe App, Stripe customers get even more financial agility, allowing them to draw funds from their Fundbox Line of Credit directly from their Stripe dashboard.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.13.20-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16487" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.13.20-AM.png" alt="Stripe dashboard with Fundbox app integration" width="1258" height="826" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.13.20-AM.png 1258w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.13.20-AM-768x504.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Benefits of a Fundbox Line of Credit</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.55.31-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16489" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.55.31-AM.png" alt="Fundbox offers quick application, fast access to funds, and flexible terms" width="1286" height="282" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.55.31-AM.png 1286w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-11-at-9.55.31-AM-768x168.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1286px) 100vw, 1286px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to business financing, some of the most important considerations are speed, convenience, and flexibility of access to funds. A Fundbox Line of Credit offers more flexibility than financing options from traditional lenders, such as banks and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit unions. Traditional lenders can take weeks or even months to approve applications and release funds. Fundbox offers a fast, paperless application, quick access to funds, and flexible repayment terms. A Fundbox Line of Credit is revolving, so your available credit replenishes as you repay, giving you the flexibility your business needs to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Fundbox Line of Credit, eligible customers can also take advantage of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox Flex Pay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and get three extra business days to pay expenses and automate payments, ensuring vendors and expenses can be paid on time. Fundbox Flex Pay can be used for payroll, insurance, taxes, raw materials, marketing, inventory, leases, and more.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Stripe customers can apply</b></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-16510 alignleft" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/approval-email-2.png" alt="Stripe login after Fundbox credit approval" width="353" height="540" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/approval-email-2.png 1200w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/approval-email-2-768x1174.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/approval-email-2-1005x1536.png 1005w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for a Fundbox Line of Credit through the Fundbox Stripe App is easy and will not impact your credit score. If you’re a Stripe customer, head to the Stripe Apps Marketplace and download the Fundbox app to get started. Simply register, connect business accounts like your bank account and accounting software, and you can get a decision in as few as three minutes. If approved, you can draw from your Fundbox Line of Credit directly from your Stripe account, and funds can be available as soon as the next business day. You can draw funds anytime, and you’ll only pay for what you use.</span></p>

As a product-based business, you’re focused on making sure that your products are unique, high-quality, and marketable while managing the cost of producing, shipping, storing, and delivering those products to your customers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/inventory-management/inventory.shtml"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refers to the stock of product you sell and can include raw materials, partially finished products, and packing materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory management is the process of ensuring that you have enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand while investing in new production and selling your inventory at a profitable rate. It also includes the logistics behind manufacturing your product and getting it out to your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow goes hand-in-hand with inventory management. Carefully determining how your working capital is best used to invest in inventory is crucial to maintaining your profitability. In this article, we’ll go over a few of the core costs associated with inventory, the challenges of managing those costs, and how a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you solve those challenges. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of inventory management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run a product-based business, your operations revolve around developing and optimizing your inventory management strategy and </span><a href="https://www.tradegecko.com/inventory-management/techniques-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">techniques</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are many factors affecting how much you need to spend on inventory that are likely to change as your business expands and responds to seasonal changes in sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re investing in inventory, you’re often paying for more than just the product itself. It’s important to understand all the costs associated with your inventory so you can optimize your inventory management strategy accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost of goods sold (COGS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good place to start. This number includes all expenses your business incurs to produce your product. You can find your COGS listed on your income statement or </span><a href="https://online-calculator.org/cost-of-goods-sold-calculator.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use the COGS formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to calculate it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the costs that are associated with COGS and inventory acquisition in general include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Manufacturing costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of the materials and labor needed to produce your goods. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Holding or carrying costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The cost of storing and holding stock in a warehouse until it is sold to the customer or shipped to the retailer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Landed costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of shipping and freight, import fees, taxes, duties, and other expenses associated with transporting inventory. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Distribution costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The costs of </span><a href="https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/distribution-cost/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delivering your product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the producer to retailers or customers. This is typically not included in your COGS calculation and can include the cost of marketing and advertising.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges of inventory management</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major hurdles product-based businesses face is filling in the gaps between investing in inventory and getting paid for it. Depending on your business model, it could take months to see sales from inventory you’ve purchased to cover the costs of that inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct-to-consumer brands have a different sales cycle than wholesale and B2B companies. For direct-to-consumer brands, situations like seasonal launches might require paying for product months ahead of the time it will be up for sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wholesalers working with third-party distributors often have to wait until retailers pay the distributor and for the distributor to pay them in turn. For B2B companies, there’s often a time lag between receiving a purchase order (PO) from a customer and receiving payment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses also need to keep in mind that they need to have enough inventory to meet demand, but purchasing too much inventory can increase holding costs and impact your cash flow going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solving inventory management challenges with a business line of credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastering the ongoing juggling act between inventory management and cash flow is possible with the right resources. One of the ways businesses overcome the challenges associated with inventory management is with inventory financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory financing is a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/inventory-financing-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short-term loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or line of credit used to cover the upfront costs of purchasing inventory or investing in inventory-related expenses like manufacturing supplies or warehousing space. Inventory financing options typically use the inventory itself as collateral. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are the best option for small business inventory financing. Unlike a loan, a line of credit replenishes as you repay the balance. This allows you continuous access to the funds you need to front the cost of inventory. When you sell the inventory and cash flows in, you can pay off your line of credit and use the freed-up credit to purchase your next round of inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inventory financing with a line of credit enables you to stabilize your cash flow while you ensure that you have enough stock to meet the demands of your customers. It can also help you bridge seasonal gaps in sales and buy extra stock as you approach your busiest times of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a line of credit, you can also remain in good standing with your suppliers, potentially increasing your business credit score.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See how one of our customers, musical instrument retailer Ponce de Leon, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/case-studies/how-a-synchrony-partner-usic-store-used-fundbox-to-invest-in-inventory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses a line of credit to get early payment discounts and stock unique, high-ticket products in their music store business.</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using Fundbox for inventory financing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers lines of credit that businesses can use to finance their inventory management and operational costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a garden center might need to purchase extra stock ahead of their busy spring season. Using the line of credit, they can finance the cost of the inventory of plants and tools including warehousing, shipping, and even their increased greenhouse heating bill before they’ve made a sale. When the busy season hits, they can then use that incoming revenue to pay down the revolving balance and use those funds again for more inventory or to cover new opportunities for growth, like a mid-season marketing campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox provides 12 and 24 week repayment periods with a consistent repayment amount so that you never fall behind on paying down your balance, empowering you to manage your cash flow even more consistently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/flex-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox Flex Pay </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can pay for inventory-related costs that you cannot put on a credit card (such as invoices to your suppliers) and have three extra days to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the inventory financing you need to invest in the business while effectively managing your cash flow. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a Fundbox line of credit to see if you qualify. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox makes capital available to businesses through business loans and lines of credit made by First Electronic Bank, a Utah chartered Industrial Bank, member FDIC, in addition to invoice-clearing advances, business loans, and lines of credit made directly by Fundbox.</span></i></p>

To support this growth, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) created the </span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/get-certified"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This program helps LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and business owners to compete in the mainstream marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certification can offer a number of benefits, including helping you connect with other businesses and organizations that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed to diversity and inclusion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also highlights your commitment to equality and helps promote your business as a leader in the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll walk you through the process of getting certified as an LGBTQIA+ owned business and how it can benefit your business moving forward.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is granted by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. The NGLCC is the exclusive, third-party certification body that verifies that eligible businesses are majority-owned by LGBTQIA+ individuals. It also subsequently grants the Certified LGBT Business Enterprise® (Certified LGBTBE®) designation to such businesses as part of its</span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/SDI-FAQ#1a"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBT Supplier Diversity Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This certification gives LGBTQIA+ business owners access to a number of benefits, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A powerful business network of over 200 corporate partners. Each partner is committed to supplier diversity and the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ owned businesses in their supply chains.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased visibility for your business through NGLCC’s extensive online database of Certified LGBTBE® companies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to NGLCC’s national, international, and local events throughout the year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who qualifies for LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for NGLCC certification, your business must be majority-owned by an LGBTQIA+ person or persons. In addition, at least 51 percent of the management and daily operations of the company must be controlled by LGBTQIA+ individuals. The application process includes providing documentation to prove both ownership and citizenship.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LGBTQIA+ community is a thriving economic driver. In fact, data shows that there is over</span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/334983"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.7 trillion dollars in purchasing power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the LGBTQIA+ community. In addition, research from the NGLCC found that LGBTQIA+ buyers are 75 percent more likely to change brands if they know they are inclusive of the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does LGBTBE® certification connect you with like-minded business owners and corporate allies, but it also allows your company to tap into a whole host of exclusive opportunities. Some of these include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to exclusive networking and business development opportunities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free or discounted rates for NGLCC events and webinars.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentorship and educational programs through the NGLCC network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounts on products and services from NGLCC partners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarship opportunities through Tuck&#8217;s School of Business Executive Education Program at Dartmouth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) to consumers, employees, and partners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, diversity and inclusion has become a top priority for many American businesses. Gaining LGBTBE® certification can help you stand out when competing for business opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also serve as a role model for up-and-coming LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and help pave the way for a more inclusive economy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for LGBTBE® certification are available online through the NGLCC. There is a four-step application process for businesses that wish to become certified. Application fees are typically waived for any business that is already a member of a local NGLCC-affiliated Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how to get started.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Fill out the online application</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, create a business profile on</span><a href="http://my.nglcc.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my.nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this stage, you need to provide documentation to prove that you meet the requirements for certification. The required paperwork must attest that each majority company owner is LGBTQIA+ and that they have control, manage, operate, and possess at least 51 percent of the firm. You can learn more about the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/steps-lgbtbe-certification"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">specific documentation required for NGLCC certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note there is a $400 fee (current to the time of this post’s publication) to submit your application.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Schedule an on-site visit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Certified LGBTBE® companies must provide site visits to the NGLCC&#8217;s regional certification committees. These visits serve two purposes: First, they provide an opportunity for the committee to become familiar with the business and its day-to-day operations. Second, these visits give committee members a chance to get to know you and your business goals better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site visits are generally 30 minutes long and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Your application will be reviewed</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your visit, the National Certification Committee will determine your certification status. This process can take up to 90 days.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Get approved and onboarded</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your application is approved, you&#8217;ll be invited to participate in an orientation webinar. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the benefits of certification and how to make the most of them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification for people of color</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intersectionality is a key value at NGLCC, which is why they&#8217;ve committed to promoting LGBTBE® certification for people of color through the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/coci"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities of Color Initiative (CoCI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a person of color and are interested in getting certified, reach out to </span><a href="mailto:coci@nglcc.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coci@nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTQIA+ businesses who are also </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/loans-minority-owned-businesses-10-options-consider/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be eligible for Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certification, which can offer additional opportunities for government contracts and set-asides (contracts that the government has set aside for businesses that comply with certain requirements). Learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-certified-minority-business-enterprise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBE certification here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrate your pride with LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a Certified LGBTBE® company can help your business connect with a wider community of LGBTQIA+ supporters, as well as government institutions and funding options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, by increasing your business&#8217;s visibility as an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone, you&#8217;re not only supporting the LGBTQIA+ community, but also helping to create a more diverse and prosperous future for us all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="477" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="choosing a bank" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, one of your most important partnerships is with your bank. When you’re choosing where to do your small business banking, it’s important to research which institutions will meet your unique needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that many financial services are available online, your list of options is growing, and it can be overwhelming to figure out the best place to start. Many banks offer similar features and services, but not all of them will be the right fit for your business as it grows. Here are a few factors you should keep in mind as you look for the right bank for your small business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your business goals and assess your financial history </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A critical first step is to review </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where your business is now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and where it’s headed. You should choose a bank that can grow with you. You might not need products like a business loan in the next six months, but you may need one as you build on your success and continue to expand your business in a year. For example, you may need accounts that allow you to upgrade to handle more transactions as you take on clients or suppliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for a while, take a look at the last 6 to 12 months of financial history and cash flow patterns. Understanding how you spend and receive money will indicate which banking features you’ll need. Do you need higher limits on your credit card? Will you need access to small business loans? Would a business line of credit help you better manage gaps in cash flow?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your credit score. If your score is low, large national banks may not approve you for all the products you need. You can always sign on with a major bank or credit union and choose online lending options to leverage in tandem when you need access to additional funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you expand your business, you might want to take advantage of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offer affordable financing options to small businesses. Look for institutions that provide SBA-backed loans and resources tailored to small businesses. Also, credit unions and regional or local banks often have programs specifically geared towards small businesses in their area.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware of fees for the features you’ll use the most</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good idea of your business’s financial patterns, you should look for banks with products and services that help you maintain or improve your finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, you need to have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/open-business-bank-account/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business checking account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to house funds and for your everyday transactions. Some banks charge fees if you do not maintain a minimum account balance, but that may not be an issue if you know that you always have extra cash to keep the balance high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you grow your business, you’ll likely need credit cards with higher limits or access to funding options like business loans and lines of credit, which come with their own costs. Additionally, you might need to be able to upgrade your accounts to allow for more transactions throughout the month without incurring extra fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking into extra financing for your business, always look for options that have a low annual percentage rate (APR), which means the institution isn’t charging too many fees on top of your interest payment. Many online financial platforms offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with low or no additional fees. For example, Fundbox does not charge origination fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re looking into ways to save money on your small business banking services, see if you can earn money through the interest rates offered on your desired accounts.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that banking is about building a relationship </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank is part of your business. When you develop a relationship with your bank, they’re likely to see you as less of a risk over time, making it easier to secure financing like loans, lines of credit, and mortgages. It’s easier to build a personal relationship with your bank if you choose a local bank or credit union, especially those that are invested in supporting small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller banks may also have advisory services and resources specifically geared towards small business owners. Developing a personal relationship with your banker or advisor means that they get to know your business and can suggest the best products to help you grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for banks that have experience in your industry and understand your business. Many national banks have specialized industry bankers who know the challenges that your particular business might face and can recommend more personalized solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s helpful to choose a bank that has a physical branch where you can meet with a banker or advisor in person, particularly when you need to resolve issues or when you’re looking for advice about the products they offer. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about convenience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you’re likely wearing many hats and juggling several aspects of your operations every day. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best banks for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it as easy as possible to manage your finances when it’s convenient for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online options enable you to handle your everyday banking from anywhere, at any time. However, if you run a brick-and-mortar business, choose a bank with a physical branch that’s close to your location, making it easy to complete regular cash deposits. Ensure that the bank’s hours fit around your business hours so you can spend your time focusing on your customers during that time, rather than standing in line at the bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you travel nationally for your business, you’ll want to select small business banking options that are available across every state, or institutions with low fees for using other banks’ ATMs and services. This is also a major consideration if you travel internationally. Narrow down the options that offer you optimal support and access to your money everywhere you do business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you should choose a bank with the right balance of online accessibility, convenient branch locations, and overall exceptional customer service. Think of your bank as an extension of your business, like a supplier or retailer. The best bank for you is the one that will help you through every stage of your business journey. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="477" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus-768x477.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Fundbox plus" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus-768x477.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right line of credit for your business can be challenging for any business owner. Businesses often need access to funds to operate, and because cash flow gaps are not uncommon, many business owners find themselves without enough working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might need to purchase or upgrade expensive equipment, or you could be waiting on payments from several clients. Situations like these can have a serious impact on cash flow and even threaten the stability of your business. If you have a line of credit in place, however, you can handle these challenges with confidence, knowing you have access to the capital your business needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s essential to gain a clear understanding of the financial implications for your business. To ensure your business gets the most value from the lender and line of credit product, there are a handful of factors you may want to consider.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to consider when shopping for a line of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan terms are a key consideration when looking for a line of credit. Some companies specialize in longer payback periods, while others require quick repayment. Do you prefer monthly or weekly payments? Do you want to repay over 12, 24, or 52 weeks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, it’s important to think about the product experience and availability of customer support. In what ways will the lender provide support for your business? If you have a question about your line of credit, or if you need to resolve an issue, will you be helped in a timely manner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, a traditional bank was one of your only options for getting access to a line of credit. However, due to advances in financial technology, business owners now have many more when they’re looking for capital. With the help of algorithms, machine learning, and at-your-fingertips technology, online lenders can offer quicker and easier access to capital than traditional lenders — like banks and credit unions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More lending options mean more choice, and when you choose a line of credit product like a Fundbox Line of Credit, you’ll have the option to upgrade to Fundbox Plus, which can provide many additional benefits to your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Fees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every lender is different, and their differences extend from their application process to their fees, penalties, qualification requirements, and timeline.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you finalize an application, it’s important to compare fees and interest rates to ensure you’re getting the best deal. It’s also important to know if simply applying for a loan will impact your credit score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such fee to consider is a draw fee, which you will incur each time you draw upon the line of credit. The draw fee varies based on the lender, but is usually between 1 and 2 percent of the amount withdrawn at the time. For example, if your line of credit has a draw fee of 2 percent and you draw $10,000, the draw fee would be $200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your funding needs, financial health, and relationship with a lender, it might be in your best interest to opt for a premium tiered line of credit — like Fundbox Plus. For $99/month, Fundbox Plus offers 20 percent lower fees on new draws. So, if you’re planning to use your line of credit multiple times over the course of a year, it might make sense to consider a more premium line of credit option that offers lower fees and additional benefits.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Time to Pay</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A generous grace period before repayment begins can give your business finances a leg up. With Fundbox Plus, you get up to 28 days before your repayment begins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows you to save what would otherwise be the initial payment, and you can use it to cover the cost of other timely, important expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider longer terms with lower payments. By extending your repayment term to 52 weeks, you can benefit from lower weekly  payment amounts, which can help you save money in the long run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer repayment terms can offer you additional flexibility on how you make use of your line of credit. For example, rather than making small, sporadic draws to cover cash flow gaps, you might draw on your line of credit to invest in expensive equipment or other costly business growth initiatives — all at a lower weekly payment amount because you have extended terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your working capital without sacrificing cash flow. Shifting from a weekly repayment schedule to a monthly* repayment option could help you free up cash flow for the rest of the month, enabling you to invest in more time-sensitive expenses like a marketing or advertising campaign for a seasonal sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Payments made once every four weeks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priority Support </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use your business line of credit regularly, it’s a good idea to consider overall product experience and how easily you can access the lender’s support team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of the customer support you receive can be critical to your happiness with your business line of credit. Whether you have a quick question or need more customized assistance, it’s valuable to be able to pick up the phone and get your question answered or problem resolved. Fundbox has invested in its customer support services, creating a highly skilled team that delivers a great experience both over the phone and via email. The support team even won the gold Stevie Award for outstanding customer support in the financial services category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Fundbox Plus, you have access to a dedicated support number and email address, so you’re sure to have your requests prioritized and managed by a highly trained representative.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive Benefits</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-three percent of business owners admit to having felt lonely while running their company, with a third saying that they feel this way consistently, according to</span><a href="https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2017/12/73-of-sme-owners-admit-to-feeling-lonely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new research </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched by Ultimate Finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a business owner can be exciting and satisfying, but it can also be isolating at times. It can be quite challenging for small business owners to find the community or support they need — especially on a tight budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support from a like-minded community of business professionals is an invaluable aspect of running a successful business. With the exclusive benefits afforded by a top-tier line of credit product like Fundbox Plus, you gain access to custom-tailored events, exclusive discounts from our partners, and so much more. </span></p>

There are many reasons small business owners seek out loans, but typically speaking, loans are sought to scale the business, and ultimately make it more profitable. This might include investing in real estate, equipment, and inventory purchases, for example.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a small business loan can be an excellent stepping-stone to help you accelerate the growth of your business, many small business owners are unsure where to start or how to get one. There are certainly plenty of available options, but reviewing them all doesn’t have to be a complex process. If you need help getting started, here are five steps you can take to streamline the application process, increase your chances of approval, and ultimately, set your business up for success. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Create a plan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to getting a small business loan, try to adopt the perspective of a bank or lending company. They need to weigh the risk of lending to you and your level of preparation can make all the difference. There is no room for improvisation on a small business loan application, which is why it’s important that you do the necessary homework first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish your reason for borrowing and determine your needs. Create a financial plan that contains a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-true-cost-of-your-small-business-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the funds you will need. Develop a carefully planned </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> containing evidence-based information such as financial forecasts, profit and loss statements, and cash flow records.  Assemble any other supporting documentation you may need to submit with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can include your formal business plan, bank statements, personal identification documents, and similar documentation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Research</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of small business loans, and you’ll need to do your research in order to understand which financing option is the best fit for your needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loans can be vastly different depending on the purpose of the financing and how quickly you need access to it. Get to know the basic information and main differences between some of the core small business loan types: long-term versus short-term, equipment, working capital, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government-backed loans.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Consider the likelihood of approval</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many factors that influence whether you’re eligible to obtain a small business loan. Most lenders will need to pull your credit rating to process your application. The very fact that a potential lender is reviewing your credit history can have an impact on your credit score, so it&#8217;s best to be strategic in deciding what and how many loan applications to make. That said, there are also lenders who do not do a hard credit inquiry and instead consider alternative qualifying criteria such as annual revenue. Understanding how you’ll be assessed and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing accordingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can greatly improve your chances of approval and also spare you wasting time on applications for loans you aren’t likely to qualify for.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Prepare and review documentation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your small business loan application is only as good as your documentation. Even if you have a pristine credit history and an excellent business plan, submitting your application with missing or ill-prepared documentation can cause your application to be rejected. If some of your documentation is older or out of date, be sure to review it prior to submitting your application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Below are some of the documents you may be required to submit: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal financial statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal credit report</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal tax returns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business forecast</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State registrations and licenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal documentation (articles of incorporation, commercial leases, franchise agreements, and the like)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Apply</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself ample lead time to apply. The time between application and approval differs depending on various factors, including loan amount, loan type, and lender. Application forms for some traditional providers such as banks and credit unions are lengthy and require extensive supporting paperwork. The wait time to hear back on your loan application from these traditional lenders is also usually lengthy, sometimes ranging from one to six months. However, one way to streamline or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/lenders-secrets-speed-business-loan-approval/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speed up your loan application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to choose an online lender like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as they can generally provide you with a credit decision in minutes. This is because online lenders typically utilize the latest digital software and automate the application process to ensure it is quick and efficient. Nonetheless, preparing ahead of time, as outlined here, will help you tackle the application with greater ease and efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let costs or unfavorable terms catch you by surprise. Be sure to carefully read all the fine print. Be on the lookout for application fees, early repayment fees, late repayment fees, and SBA loan guarantee fees — all these can have an effect on your annual percentage rate (APR). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To-do list for your small business loan application</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a one-pager of your business profile and include:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long you’ve been in business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many employees you have</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax ID number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average gross annual revenue</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a cash flow analysis on your business account</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand and be able to explain your business credit history</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect at least 3 months of bank statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get business references</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare tax statements</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many small business owners seek out loans to accelerate the growth of their business. You may be unsure where to start or how to get one. While there are many available options, reviewing them all doesn’t have to be a complex process. </span></p>

Business owners typically wear many different hats and have much going on, so their time must be spent wisely. You don’t want to invest valuable time putting together a loan application only to have it denied. It’s best to approach it with careful consideration and proper preparation. With planning, research, and proper documentation in hand, you can ease your way through the process, save time, and increase the odds of approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small business loan can be an important step forward for your small business, helping to set you up for ongoing business growth and success. Follow the five steps outlined above to optimize the efficiency of your small business loan application and increase your chances of approval.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FundboxPlus-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Woman in an apron working at a coffee shop" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FundboxPlus-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FundboxPlus.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you&#8217;ve likely given more than a passing thought to how you can build business credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business credit profile is one measure of the financial health of your company, and a reflection of how your business meets its financial obligations. Establishing a credit history and building good business credit are essential to the success of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to build business credit, it’s important to understand one of its key contributing factors: your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-business-credit-score/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you&#8217;re seeking financing, showing your creditworthiness will be a big part of applying and getting approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But your business credit profile (and business credit score) come up in more situations, too. For example, if you’re looking to negotiate good terms with your suppliers, get the best lease on commercial property, or secure good insurance premiums, your good business credit could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, good business credit makes for a sustainable, growth-oriented business. Here are some things you can do to help build good business credit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 things you can do to establish and build your business credit</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Check your personal and business credit files</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you want to do is check your personal and business credit score. For your personal score, go to </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AnnualCreditReport.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a free source of credit reports </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports"><span style="font-weight: 400;">verified by the government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and operated by the three national reporting companies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. By Federal law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from the credit bureaus every 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/analyze-business-credit-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check your report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for errors. Look for any inaccuracies in every section, including your personal information, SSN, accounts, and loans. Report any incorrect information to the business that issued the account or the credit reporting company that issued the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, check out your business credit report. You can request these from </span><a href="https://www.dnb.com/products/small-business/check-my-business-credit.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/small-business/business-credit-reports.jsp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.equifax.com/business/business-credit-reports-small-business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equifax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have a credit file with these agencies or are new to business, you can set one up by registering for a D-U-N-S number (used to identify companies in the U.S.) with Dun &amp; Bradstreet. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Add trade references to your credit file</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade references are vital to a strong business credit score. These reflect your good record of payments with suppliers and vendors. Some will be proactive about sharing this information with the credit reporting agencies, but they aren’t required to do so. You can also add them on your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your score is determined by a few things, including the number of trade experiences you have, outstanding balances, payment habits, and demographics (such as years on file, business size, etc.)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish credit with vendors and suppliers who report to credit bureaus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all vendors, suppliers, businesses, and others with whom your business interacts will report to the credit bureaus. But working with those who do is a way to build business credit and boost your business credit score. A history of responsible payment (on time, or even early) builds good business credit, so ask your vendors and others whether they report your payment activity. Your strong credit rating may help you increase your borrowing power, obtain more favorable financing terms from lenders, or increase the likelihood of other businesses working with you.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a business credit card</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be an indispensable asset for any business. Of course, you can use this card to pay for business expenses such as supplies and equipment, and most cards come with perks such as cash back or travel rewards. But equally important, if you use it responsibly and reliably pay on time, a business credit card can also be leveraged to build strong business credit history and a solid credit rating, potentially helping your business qualify for additional — and better — financing options in the future, should you need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do keep in mind that if you’re looking to finance large purchases of equipment or to capitalize on a timely but costly opportunity for your business’s growth, a business credit card likely will not be sufficient for your needs. A better, more flexible financing option for such purchases is a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-business-line-credit-can-help-grow-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers a revolving balance that replenishes as you pay off what you’ve used. If you’re looking for a line of credit for your business, you may want to consider a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox Line of Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make payments to creditors on time or early</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your payment habits have a big impact on your credit score. If you pay before a due date, or even 15-30 days in advance (cash flow permitting), you’ll improve your Dun &amp; Bradstreet Paydex score. The Paydex score ranges from 1–100 and is an important indicator of a business’s past payment performance. The higher the Paydex score, the greater the likelihood that a business will pay its debts on time. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor your business credit reports</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve spent so much time building your credit, keep an eye on it. As noted, you are able to access your personal credit report for free on an annual basis, and it’s a smart idea to do just that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may want to keep even closer track of your business credit report. </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/free-business-credit-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 5 places you can go to check your business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But you most likely want to check your business credit report much more frequently than once per year. If you want to check it on a monthly basis, look to any of the top business credit agencies (Experian, Equifax, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet). They all offer a range of business credit monitoring services, but be aware that you will likely have to pay for this, and prices vary. However, monitoring is important if you’re actively looking to build credit. Monitoring will let you know when new activity is detected and allow you to stay on top of any mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrating responsible management of your business credit will help provide your business with more options, from availability of financing to favorable loan terms to access to suppliers and vendors. Simply put, building strong business credit is a key factor in establishing and growing your successful small business. </span></p>

You need funding to start achieving your goals. If you’re looking at financing options, a startup business loan is a great solution that allows you to build your business’s credit history, which will help you qualify for other types of credit in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional bank loans can be difficult for entrepreneurs to secure until they have a solid business history and strong business credit. Because many small businesses are underserved by banks, there are plenty of other options available to new businesses looking for financing to help them get started. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online term loans and business lines of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders can provide similar financing options to banks, including term loans and business lines of credit, with significantly streamlined application and approval processes. However, most online lenders require you to be in business for at least six months, as credit decisions are based on your financial history (as opposed to projections). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, look for lenders that offer flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and loan options for growing businesses with reasonable interest and annual percentage rates (APR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on loans from online lenders typically start at about </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/blog/what-is-the-average-business-loan-interest-rate-37650/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Also consider your repayment terms, to ensure that you can make your regularly scheduled payments without disrupting your cash flow. The more structured your repayment plan, the more likely you are to pay off your loan in time without extra financial burden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans from local community organizations </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best places to look for funding, especially when you’re at the beginning of your business journey, is your local business and economic development organizations and nonprofit groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders like these can provide resources, education, and networking opportunities alongside financing options. They have a vested interest in helping local businesses thrive and can point you towards different funding opportunities as you expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide access to loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) as well as funds from other lending programs such as the </span><a href="http://www.toryburchfoundation.org/programs/capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory Burch Foundation Capital Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides financing for women entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and municipal business development programs also provide startup business loans, so check your local government websites for options. For example, New York state offers the </span><a href="https://esd.ny.gov/metropolitan-economic-revitalization-fund-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund (MERF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses that are creating jobs in low-income areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also many microlenders across the country who work with startups and small businesses to help them get off the ground. Microlenders like </span><a href="https://www.pacificcommunityventures.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacific Community Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in California and </span><a href="https://www.liftfund.com/loan-offerings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LiftFund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which serves the southeastern U.S., provide access to SBA loans and other financing opportunities alongside educational resources. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset-based financing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a limited business credit history or </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/small-business/startup-business-loans-bad-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a low credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, secured, asset-based financing options like invoice factoring, merchant cash advances, and loans against specific collateral can help you get the financing you need as a startup. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of financing where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party who in turn provides a sum of cash equal to a portion of the invoice amounts. Your clients then pay their invoices to the factoring company. This type of financing works well if you already have a high volume of outstanding invoices in your accounts receivables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/merchant-cash-advance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant cash advance,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’re provided with a sum of money up front that you pay down with a percentage of your credit card sales. This financing option carries one of the highest interest rates, since it does not typically rely on your credit, but is instead based on your everyday customer credit card transactions. This option works best if your customers pay you primarily with credit cards.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-does-equipment-financing-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the best ways for new businesses to get the machinery and vehicles they need to get started because they use the equipment itself as collateral — similar to a mortgage. You can also leverage </span><a href="https://na.doosanequipment.com/en/news-stories/the-cutting-edge/buy-rent-or-lease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leasing and rent-to-own options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the equipment you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a business owner with a low personal credit score who’s looking for financing, be wary of lenders who say that they will guarantee approval without looking at your business credit or financial standing in any capacity, as these options can turn out to be expensive or untrustworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also keep in mind that some lenders will perform what’s known as a </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-hard-inquiry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard inquiry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “hard pull” on your credit report that may negatively impact your credit score, potentially preventing you from securing funding. If several hard inquiries appear on your credit report in a short period of time, you may be less likely to be approved. Online lenders, including Fundbox, take a look at your financial history and only perform what’s known as a soft pull on your credit report when you apply, which will not affect your credit score. Be sure to look for lenders that offer a balance of flexibility around credit requirements and security around repayment terms and interest rates when it comes to securing financing. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) microloans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA provides </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $50,000 for small businesses to start up and expand. SBA microloans are provided by intermediary, nonprofit lenders who often have a mandate to support small businesses with a focus on minority- and women-owned businesses. This can make it easier for </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/sba-microloans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">startups and early-stage small businesses to qualify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the funding they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders who facilitate SBA funding will have their own terms for the loan, but interest rates are typically between 8 and 13 percent with a maximum repayment term of six years. You can use microloans for most of your business needs, including working capital, inventory, supplies, and equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowers need to have a credit score of at least 640, but some lenders offer loans to borrowers with </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/sba-microloan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scores as low as 575.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proving that you have steady revenue, providing collateral, and leveraging a cosigner can help you secure a loan even if you have a low credit score. Be aware that it can take around two to three weeks or more to get approval for a microloan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans are typically easier for new businesses to obtain than the SBA 7(a) loan, a popular option for established businesses with more credit history who need up to $5 million in financing. To see if microloans are the right option for your business, you can </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find?type=SBA%20District%20Office&amp;pageNumber=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search here for your local SBA office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business loans can boost long-term growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in your business will pay off as you grow. Startup business loans empower you to build a business you’re proud of with the right resources, equipment, and team members. With financing options that meet your needs, you can feel confident about taking on business debt to achieve your goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify for a business line of credit from Fundbox and get financing to take your business to the next level.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="DNAArticle-HollyOng" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homemade food has the power to connect people with their culture and create a thriving community around both new and familiar cuisines. Small businesses in the food industry play a unique role in shaping our neighborhoods — and our palates. For Holly Ong, co-founder of Sibeiho, building a sambal sauce brand is about bringing the flavors of her Singaporean childhood to the North American market with recipes made for seasoned foodies and busy home cooks alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last few years, hot sauces have taken their rightful place at the head of the kitchen table. </span><a href="https://www.eatthis.com/news-most-popular-hot-sauce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-four percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans put hot sauce on their food. A deliciously spicy, relish-like sauce, sambal is poised to take the condiment aisle by storm, much like its cousin </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sriracha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sibeiho’s collection of sambal sauces are made from recipes Holly and her co-founder, Patricia Lau, inherited from their families. The pair prioritize local ingredients, creating small batches of sauce from their commercial kitchen in Portland, Oregon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through her journey from working in Nike’s marketing department to putting on supper clubs for friends and family, and eventually starting the Sibeiho brand, Holly has a lot to share about building a thriving business on a foundation of passion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a recipe for success</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sambal is the pesto of Southeast Asia, with a range of variations across Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Each region and household has its own take on the recipe, but key ingredients can include garlic, onions or shallots, and chili peppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holly and Patricia found that Singaporean foods were harder to find in the U.S. (which Holly attributes to there being fewer immigrants from Singapore than other Southeast Asian countries). To get their fix of their favorite foods, the pair started running supper clubs for friends and family featuring beloved Singaporean dishes — with a side of homemade sambal. The sambal was a major hit with their guests and Holly and Patricia sensed that they were on to something.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the sambals stocked in grocery stores are filled with artificial ingredients, and Holly and Patricia saw an opening in the market for a sauce with a homemade touch. It was important to the pair that they offer sambals that are as fresh and healthy as the sauces their aunts and grandmothers made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Holly’s major considerations when starting the brand was ingredient </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">availability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oregon and Washington happen to be the largest producers of onions in the U.S. which enabled Holly and Patricia to source this essential ingredient locally, something that was also important to them. Easy access to high-quality organic onions also allowed Sibeiho to continue to scale. With a reliable source of this ingredient, Holly is confident that they can continue to grow while relying on their local onion crops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural industry ecosystem in Oregon has also been beneficial for supporting their business development. Holly and Patricia leveraged experts at food science programs at the universities in the state to help them develop shelf-stable sauces from their home recipes. They also participated in </span><a href="https://www.builtoregon.com/accelerator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer product startup accelerator where the Sibeiho team was able to access mentorship and business support.</span></p>
<h2>Building a passion-driven business</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with customer validation: test ideas (and recipes) with a potential customer base and see how they respond.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore resources when it comes to professional development, including local accelerators and university or college programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider all avenues for funding the business and prioritize investing in growth, even if it means strategically leveraging debt. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pivoting from corporate to kitchen</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Sibeiho is Holly’s second career. Before starting the company, she worked for Nike in brand management and bringing products to market. However, after years of working for a Fortune 500 company, Holly was looking for more personally meaningful work. She and Patricia — who she was working with at Nike — bonded over their homesickness for Singaporean food, and Holly found that making and sharing the cuisine she loved fulfilled that desire to do something she was passionate about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holly’s job at Nike involved customer validation and understanding what consumers were looking for. This corporate skill set transferred seamlessly into her work as an entrepreneur. Her experience helped her see an opportunity to capitalize on her culinary talent while she and Patricia were running their supper clubs for fun. The supper clubs also provided an avenue for customer validation and established an audience of sambal converts who were likely to spread the word about the sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we chose sambal over running a restaurant or making something else was that it’s the condiment that we would have in our fridge to do a very quick meal, to not have to think very hard, to create something healthy to feed the family,” Holly says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting to create consumer packaged products rather than expanding their supper club also helped the company stay flexible during the COVID-19 pandemic. While </span><a href="https://pdx.eater.com/2021/3/22/22345126/sibeiho-market-sambal-takeout-singapore-pdx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their supper clubs were canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sibeiho continued to sell sambal as well as takeout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes — multi-tiered lunch containers similar to tiffins used to carry small meals. Customers signed up for weekly emails with the latest menu and were able to pick up the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes from Sibeiho’s Portland storefront. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes and sambal fit perfectly into a market flooded with increasing demand for ready-made foods. One of Holly’s young customers said that her mom had been putting Sibeiho’s sambal into crockpot chicken meals, a dish that had become a family favorite. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">takeout</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">boxes were also popular with parents overwhelmed with caretaking while working at home through the pandemic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a place on grocery store shelves</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, Holly and Pat attended virtual trade shows to begin the process of getting Sibeiho sambals into grocery stores.  “Food is a very personal choice,” Holly says. “We were asking consumers to try a product that they&#8217;ve never seen. We needed them to [take] this leap of faith with us to try something new.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As luck would have it, since restaurants were closed during the lockdown, home cooks were more inclined to try new recipes and seek out unique ingredients. The pandemic conditions propelled interest in sambal while Oregon’s foodie culture created an environment where local grocery retailers like Market of Choice and New Seasons were excited to carry Sibeiho sauces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that Holly wishes she had done differently while managing the business through the pandemic was leveraging </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takeout boxes provided most of the revenue for the business while Holly and Patricia worked to get Sibeiho out to grocery retailers. Holly was hesitant to take on debt, but she learned that she could use smaller loans to cover cash flow and invest in equipment and supplies the business needs to continue to expand. Taking on a small business loan in the future will allow Holly to purchase more commercial kitchen supplies and get started on new projects without waiting for the capital to come in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sibeiho is a labor of love that honors childhood memories and the joy that comes from bringing new cultural cuisines to a hungry customer base. Starting this business has allowed Holly to reconnect with her roots and engage with her community through food. With a continuous learning mindset, Holly and her team plan to uncover better ways to drive their business forward and make sure that Sibeiho sambal is soon a kitchen staple across the country. </span></p>
