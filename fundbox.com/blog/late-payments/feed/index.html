					<description><![CDATA[Hi Anna - How does invoice financing help small businesses manage late payments?  Would&#039;t a late payment still be damaging, even with invoice financing?  For example, a small business has a net 30 invoice that they finance.  It doesn&#039;t get paid until day 45.  By that point they have paid back the entire loan, but have not been paid by their customer.  That is to say, regardless of whether they financed, they still aren&#039;t &quot;made whole&quot; until day 45.]]></description>
