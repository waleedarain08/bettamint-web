                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re a small business owner or independent contractor who&#8217;s suffering from the economic impact of the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) could help save your company and your employees—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you act now and skip common mistakes that could get you rejected. Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP, and the program will be open until May 31, 2021 or until funding runs out. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">.</span></strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><em>The information discussed in this article was collected from a variety of external sources, and to the best of our knowledge, was correct as of December 28, 2020. Some of the PPP details have changed with the restart of the program, and we are awaiting final guidance from the SBA, at which time those details will be updated here. This content is for informational purposes only. Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide financial, legal, or accounting advice. You should consult your own financial, legal, or accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help explain the PPP loan,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here are updated answers to some key questions about the loan program, including necessary application documents, authorized uses for the loan, loan forgiveness, and special circumstances for independent contractors. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about a quick overview of the PPP program and what it means to small businesses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As we all know, due to closures and restrictions, the coronavirus has severely impacted the economy. This is especially true for small businesses and their employees, as well as independent contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 27, the government passed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act—the CARES Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and on December 27, 2020, the Covid Relief Bill was added to renew financial assistance programs. These stimulus packages were designed to give financial relief to individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These acts include two loan options for businesses: the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP), and the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or EIDL. </span><b>This article focuses on just the PPP loan.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a PPP loan? What makes it different? Why should I be trying to take out yet another loan at a time like this?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PPP loan is a new program from the Small Business Administration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I think it may be a disservice to call this program a loan. It&#8217;s more like a loan that converts to a grant, and it&#8217;s for small businesses—typically those with fewer than 500 employees—to help them maintain their employees and their payroll over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is hopefully the most significant business disruption. It&#8217;s unique in a few ways. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it&#8217;s </span><b>low interest</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just 1 percent. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, as the name implies, it&#8217;s</span><b> intended to support payroll costs (or self-employment income) and/or business operating expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like rent, mortgage interest, and some operation expenses. Qualified businesses can borrow up to $2 million at a 1% interest rate, calculated based on 2.5 times your average monthly payroll costs, or 3.5 months if you’re in the food service or accommodation industry (businesses with a NAICS code starting with 72).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third, and to some this is most important: it&#8217;s </span><b>potentially forgivable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, becoming a grant that you might not have to pay back—as long as you use the money from the loan according to the rules of the program. </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is eligible to apply for a PPP loan, especially if I don&#8217;t have employees other than myself?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are basically eligible to apply for a PPP loan if you are a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or an </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/independent-contractors-guide-cares-act-relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">independent contractor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or other self-employed individual who has been harmed by the pandemic—as long as all of the following are true:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have 500 or fewer employees (300 or fewer if applying for a second draw PPP).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your tangible net worth is under $15 million and the average net income for full two fiscal years prior to application does not exceed $5 million. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are not a publicly traded company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You were already</span><b> in-operation on February 15, 2020.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><b>primary place of residence is the United States</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (You have to be a U.S. Citizen).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has filed a 2019 tax return with the IRS. For independent contractors, this means a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2019 showing self-employment income. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, to qualify, you must certify in good faith that the loan is “necessary to support [your] ongoing operations.” (In other words, PPP loans should be your only way of accessing needed money.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>If applying for a second draw PPP loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you must also attest that:</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">You have 300 or fewer employees.</li>
<li aria-level="2">You have already spent all funds you received from your first PPP loan.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experienced a reduction of at least 25% in gross receipts during the first, second, third, or fourth quarter in 2020 relative to the same quarter in 2019.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business has no significant ties to China.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, some new </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may make you eligible for a PPP loan even if your business previously didn&#8217;t qualify for an SBA loan. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are operating as </span><b>a franchise, the normal affiliation rules do not apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (You&#8217;re counted on the size of the specific business location you own, not on the main franchisor&#8217;s numbers.)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses that have </span><b>minority shareholders (like private equity or venture capital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) can still qualify if those shareholders relinquish rights.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the accommodation and food services sector (NAICS 72), the 500-employee limit is applied on a per physical location basis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sole proprietor, independent contractor, or self-employed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tribal business concern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(3) organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(6) organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 501(c)(19) Veterans organization </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A housing cooperative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local news media outlets, including newspaper, radio or TV station</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I meet all the basic qualifications, are there some things that might still make me ineligible for a PPP loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some &#8220;yes&#8221; answers (like to questions 1, 2, 5, and 6) on the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP Borrower Application Form (revised 1.8.2021).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as a few other stipulations may automatically disqualify you. For example, business owners may be ineligible because of delinquent child support obligations, engaging in illegal activities, or they&#8217;re in one of the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SBA Form 2234C app. 4-23-14_working.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">excluded industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as: farms or ranches, gambling, businesses of a prurient sexual nature, or lobbyists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, business partners who report self-employment income are not eligible to also apply for a PPP loan as self-employed individuals. A good rule-of-thumb is: </span><b>no double-dipping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s the first step someone should take to apply?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA does not lend money directly. It only guarantees loans provided through SBA-preferred financial institutions, such as banks, microlenders, and even some fintech companies. In order to get a PPP loan, </span><b>you have to apply through a financial institution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which then submits the application to the SBA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So your first step could be to ask the financial institution you do your business banking with if they are an approved PPP lender, and if they are accepting PPP applications. If your business bank is not an approved SBA lender, you need to find a lender now. You can find a state-by-state list of approved lenders on the </span><a href="http://sba.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>SBA.gov</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you learn that your business&#8217;s bank or credit union is not an approved lender—</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SBA can help you find a lender</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the lender approves your application, it gets sent to the SBA for approval and then it’s time to cross your fingers and hope you get approved before May 31, 2021 or before the next round of funding is exhausted, whichever comes first. If you are lucky enough to get your application approved before the funds run out, </span><b>you will get notification (usually by email) to sign final agreements, you&#8217;re then issued an SBA loan number, and then payment is electronically deposited into your business bank account within 10 days.</b></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can I do to maximize my chance of getting approved for the loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it&#8217;s important to act fast, since these loans are considered on a first-come-first-served basis. The SBA does not weigh the merits of one business over another. Unfortunately, </span><b>the program is not set up to even allow for essential services—or businesses helping essential services—to take priority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s mostly a matter of timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are some things you can do to help ensure your success. Some businesses fail because they </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/common-mistake-small-businesses-make-applying-for-loans-says-sba-official.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make common mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fail to do their homework, or they&#8217;re </span><b>missing some critical documents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown of some of the documents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you&#8217;ll  want to have at your fingertips. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Please note: every lender is different, and this list may be incomplete and will be updated once we receive final guidance from the SBA and our lending partner.</em></span></span></p>

Such forms may include: Form 940, Form 941, Form 944, and your payroll processor records if you have employees. For sole proprietors and independent contractors, you&#8217;ll need your Form 1099s and Form 1040 (at least the completed Schedule C, in case you haven&#8217;t filed yet).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proof of </span><b>mortgage or rent, mortgage interest, and utility expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your business owns or works out of a vehicle that you&#8217;re making payments on, have these records handy too. Even if they&#8217;re not asked for during the application process, such records may help with calculating or proving figures for potential loan forgiveness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Articles of Incorporation </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">/ Organization. Make sure to list the established date.</span></li>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For details on these documents and a complete list of what the SBA and/or your lender will want you to provide, please see our Fundbox blog article on the </span><a href="../ppp-loan-checklist/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP Application Checklist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain the $100,000 salary cap for employee wages.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 100K limit is for calculating what loan amount and forgiveness you&#8217;re eligible for. For any individual employee who makes an annual salary over $100,000, you can only claim (and receive forgiveness for) a loan amount of what they&#8217;d make during 2.5 months (or 3.5 months if in the Food Services or Accommodations industry) as if they only had a salary of $100,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So no matter if their actual annual salary is $100,000 or $110,000 or even $150,000 per year, the SBA may only loan and forgive you for up to 2.5 (or 3.5) months of their salary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does loan forgiveness mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 100% of the PPP loan is forgivable if you follow certain requirements around payroll and employee retention during a loan forgiveness “covered period” of either 8 weeks or 24 weeks. Now all businesses have a choice between using an 8-week or 24-week covered period on which to base the forgiveness calculation (including retroactively for previous PPP loan recipients). This choice depends on how long you wish to pay your employees while being held to the criteria for forgiveness, as explained below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These forgiveness rules are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>60% of the money for payroll costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a period of 8 weeks or 24 weeks—beginning on the day the PPP funds were deposited in your business bank account. To qualify for full forgiveness, the remaining loan funds (up to 40%) must be spent on eligible non-payroll business costs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For both a first-time or second draw PPP, your loan </span><b>forgiveness can be reduced</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if—during your 8- or 24-week forgiveness period—you have:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced the number of employees, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced employee salaries by more than 25% </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: Certain </b><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_ppp_forgiveness-guide.pdf"><b>safe harbors</b></a><b> that apply that can exempt you from retention and wage related forgiveness penalties</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as in situations when an employee refused to accept an offered position.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Forgiveness is not automatic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You must apply to your lender for forgiveness. However, if your loan was for less than $150,000, the SBA will provide a simplified one-page application process for loan forgiveness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you also receive or received an EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan) advance from the SBA, your amount of PPP loan forgiveness </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will not be reduced</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the amount of the EIDL advance. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Here’s how it works: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an employer and keep your employees for 8 (or 24) weeks from the time your loan is originated and maintain their salaries, the SBA will forgive the portion of the loan you used to cover payroll, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities, as long as at least 60% of the loan funds were spent on payroll, and that the remaining funds were spent on qualified business expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple caveats, though. For instance, as The Chamber of Commerce’s </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can’t factor in the salaries of employees who live outside the United States when calculating payroll.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is loan forgiveness automatic? Is the whole loan forgiven? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan forgiveness is not automatic, and it may not cover 100% of the loan if you don&#8217;t follow the rules. You must apply to your lender for forgiveness. However, the SBA will now provide a </span><b>simplified one-page </b><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/sba-form-3508-paycheck-protection-program-loan-forgiveness-application"><b>forgiveness application</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if your loan was for less than $150,000.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What &#8220;payroll costs&#8221; are forgivable?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salary, wages, commissions, or tips (capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee benefits including costs for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave; allowance for separation or dismissal; payments required for the provisions of group health care benefits including insurance premiums; and payment of any retirement benefit</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local taxes assessed on compensation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a sole proprietor or independent contractor: replacing your compensation (wages, commissions, or gross earnings from self-employment, based on your 2019 or 2020 income and capped at $100,000 on an annualized basis for each employee</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember, the intent of this PPP loan is to keep employees in their jobs and/or to cover actual business operational expenses. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you lay off any of your employees within the eight-week time period or cut wages by more than 25% for individual employees who already earn under $100,000 a year, your loan forgiveness amount may be reduced, according to the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA&#8217;s guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, there are other factors that may count towards your payroll expenses. For example, if you increased employee wages or compensation during the eight-week period—by covering employee tips, for example—you may be eligible for additional loan forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another benefit is that you can bring back any employees you’ve already laid off to be eligible for the loan. You won’t be penalized for re-hiring employees or reinstating their original wages as long as you keep them on payroll for the designated 8 or 24 weeks. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What &#8220;non-payroll costs&#8221; are forgivable?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP funds may be forgiven if they make up no more than 40% of your total loan amount and are qualifying expenses related to your business during your chosen covered 8 or 24 week period. Such expenses may include these costs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business mortgage interest payments* </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest payments on a loan (such as an auto loan) needed to perform your business*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business rent and lease payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business utility payments*</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operations expenses for business software and cloud computing services and other human resources and accounting needs that facilitate business operations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to a supplier for goods that are essential to the operations of the borrower pursuant to a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed or with respect to perishable goods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worker protection expenditures required to comply with public health guidance related to COVID-19 (such as personal protective equipment, drive-through windows, and sneeze guards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property damage costs related to looting due to public disturbances in 2020 that are not covered by insurance or other compensation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*If you are self-employed, you must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 taxes for expenses indicated with an asterisk above to be forgiven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business expenses paid for using PPP funds are now tax deductible. This applies to past and future PPP loans. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if a 1% interest loan sounds like a good deal? What if a business wants to borrow more than they know they can be forgiven for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can only borrow funds and use them for </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/PPP--IFRN FINAL_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorized purposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those purposes are payroll and associated costs, rent/mortgage interest, and utilities. That’s it. If you use the funds for anything else you’re in violation of the loan agreement and the SBA may penalize you.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not more than 40% of the loan can be used for non-payroll purposes.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 60% of the loan proceeds have to be used for payroll purposes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If PPP funds are used for unauthorized purposes, SBA will direct the borrower to repay those amounts however they do not say how quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If PPP funds are knowingly used for unauthorized purposes, the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbfreeman/2020/04/09/five-things-every-paycheck-protection-program-borrower-should-do-after-receiving-a-loan/#550c2e076170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">borrower may be subject to additional liability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as charges for fraud.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there is now a need to certify that the loan is &#8220;necessary&#8221; for business continuity. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if the borrower can demonstrate that 60% of the proceeds were used for payroll, then the entire loan will be forgiven. What remains unclear—and for which we are awaiting guidance from the SBA—is what sort of documentation will be required to support that 60%, and whether SBA will also ask for verification of how the remainder of the funds were used.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the CARES Act covers two types of loans, can I apply for both the PPP loan and an EIDL?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you’re allowed to apply for both the paycheck protection loan and disaster loan. However, you can’t use both loans for the same purpose. If you received an EIDL between January 31, 2020 and the time when the PPP loans are available, you’re still eligible for a PPP loan as long as you didn’t use your EIDL for payroll costs. Again, no double dipping.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I don&#8217;t have a payroll, how much can I borrow as an independent contractor?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most independent contractors, calculating your PPP borrowing limit is a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-step process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Find line 7</strong> (gross income) on your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (If you haven’t filed yet for 2019, go ahead and fill it out). If the amount on Line 7 is over $100,000, write $100,000.  <em>Effective March 8, 2021, most lenders will now accept line 7 (gross income instead of line 31, net income, as previously required).</em></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the amount from Step 1 by 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiply the amount from Step 2 by 2.5 (or 3.5 if your business is in the Food Services or Accommodations industry). For most borrowers, this will be your <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/PPP -- How to Calculate Maximum Loan Amounts for First Draw PPP Loans (1.17.2021)-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maximum PPP loan amount</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: If you received an EIDL loan between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 you can refinance that as part of your PPP loan (minus any amount received as an EIDL grant).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a sole proprietor and independent contractor, what can I use the PPP loan for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independent Contractor&#8217;s Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to CARES Act Relief, you can use your PPP loan to do any of the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use your PPP loan to do any of the following:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace </span><b>your compensation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (based on your 2019 income)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay</span><b> interest payments on a mortgage or loan</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (such as an auto loan) you use to perform your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business </span><b>rent </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make business </span><b>utility </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make interest payments on any other</span><b> prior debt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> incurred before February 15, 2020. (However, such prior debt payments amounts are not eligible for loan forgiveness.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to a supplier for goods that are essential to your operations, as long as a contract or purchase order in effect before the PPP loan is disbursed, or with regard to perishable goods (like many foods)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to claim a loan or request forgiveness on loan interest, rent, or utilities payments, you must have claimed a deduction on your 2019 taxes for those expenses. That&#8217;s another reason why you need to complete your Schedule C for your 2019 Form 1040, even if you haven&#8217;t filed your  taxes yet.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some banks said they have massive demand and asked applicants to go elsewhere. What does it mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many banks have allocated a certain amount of capital that they allocated toward SBA PPP loans. Some banks may be approaching that threshold. In which case they might turn some customers away. If that’s the case, there are other options beyond your bank. There’s a network of agents that work to connect business owners with banks that are eager to work with small businesses and help them get SBA PPP loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing is to understand why your application was declined. Earlier we touched on eligibility requirements. But here are a few additional, more detailed reasons why you may be rejected:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are engaging in any illegal activity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are a household employer (your payroll goes toward childcare, cleaning services, or other domestic services)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An owner of 20% or more of the business is incarcerated on probation, on parole, subject to indictment, criminal information, arraignment, or other means by which formal criminal charges are brought in any jurisdiction, or has been convicted of a felony in the last five years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You or your business or any business controlled by you or your owners has ever defaulted on an SBA loan in the last seven years </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the reason was something else, like you didn’t fill out the application properly, then you should reapply. But this time, go through the application carefully and make sure you attach all the required documents and don’t skip any steps.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the 8- or 24 week forgiveness period is over, what if I have money remaining even after having used the funds for payroll and bills? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those remaining funds, or any funds not found to be eligible for forgiveness, turn into a loan at the 1% rate, payable within 2 years.</span></p>
