The value a good accountant can offer your business cannot be overstated. It’s one of the most important decisions you can make for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A qualified and reliable accountant can help you handle dynamic and ever-evolving tax laws and navigate circumstances that could help you to scale your business in the most optimal, efficient, and economical ways. Choosing the right accountant can help you take your business to the next level; choosing the wrong accountant can be counterproductive to your business’s health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s vital that you know what to look for in a business accountant and put in the research to ensure you choose a professional who is the right fit for your business. Here are five tips to help you choose the best accountant for your small business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand your needs </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire an accountant, you should first have a basic understanding of what you want the accountant to do for you. Do you need someone to handle bookkeeping and financial statements? Or an accountant to help you prepare and file your taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bookkeeper or non-certified accountant can help with day-to-day accounting; however, if you require someone to provide strategic tax advice, file your taxes, or assist with an audit, you might be best off choosing a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Understanding the responsibilities and work you need help with, and how often, is an important step toward finding an accountant. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek referrals and reviews</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you friends with other entrepreneurs or part of a small business association or network in your community? One way to discover a dependable accountant for your business is to ask for recommendations from your peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you might also conduct a Google search to find accountants in your area. You can also seek out online reviews and use them to compare and evaluate prospects. LinkedIn, Yelp, or other online communities like Reddit and Facebook may also be helpful resources for referrals and reviews that could inform your decision.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate their qualifications and experience </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reputable accountant should have the qualifications and experience to support their knowledge and expertise. It may be in your best interest to look for an accountant who has experience working with other businesses in the same industry as you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be beneficial because they are likely to be familiar with the needs, challenges, and tax laws specific to your business type or industry. Training and formal qualifications will determine the type of accountant you can hire and the services they can provide. Here are some qualifications to look for in an accountant: </span></p>
<h3><b>CPA certification</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certified public accountant, or CPA, is an accounting professional who has passed the CPA exam and maintains the necessary qualifications to be a licensed CPA. All 50 states have different CPA licenses, and requirements for certification vary by state. In addition to the exam, applicants often need to have a bachelor’s degree and two years of experience in accounting. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has a </span><a href="https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic/findacpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can use to find CPAs, accounting companies, and local accounting organizations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMA is an accounting designation that signifies expertise in financial accounting and </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategic-management.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The certification is sponsored by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). Candidates must have a bachelor&#8217;s degree and two consecutive years in management accounting or financial management. </span></p>
<h3><b>Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CGMA is a global certification issued by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) for CPAs who work in business and government. This certification distinguishes professionals who have advanced proficiency in finance, operations, strategy, and management.</span></p>
<h3><b>Enrolled Agent (EA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EA credential recognizes professionals, including CPAs, licensed by the government to represent taxpayers. They advise clients, prepare personal and business taxes, and deal with the Internal Revenue Service on matters related to business or personal tax audits. The certification is awarded by the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/enrolled-agent-information#:~:text=An%20enrolled%20agent%20is%20a,as%20a%20former%20IRS%20employee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Other certifications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many additional accounting certifications that recognize specific skills. These include Accredited Payables Manager (APM), Accredited Payables Specialist (APS), Accredited Receivables Specialists (ARS), and Certified Payroll Professional (CPP).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with prospective candidates and ask questions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve conducted your initial research and compiled a list of a few prospects, it’s time to conduct a series of meetings or interviews with them. This is your opportunity to ask questions and gain a better understanding of how they work. Of course, you might find the answers to some of these questions with a little online research, but it’s still a good idea to spend a few minutes with a prospective accountant to get a better idea of whether they might be the right fit for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few questions you might ask prospective accountants: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What accounting qualifications and training do you have?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of accounting services do you offer?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your fees and how do you charge? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of clients do you work with? Do you have experience with other clients in my industry? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What technology or software do you use? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you support my goals? What additional value could you offer my business? </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider how they’ll help your business grow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to weigh your options and carefully consider if the accountant you’re considering will be the professional whose financial advice will help you make successful long-range decisions for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some accountants will simply focus on completing the task at hand. They will fill out tax returns and manage your accounts, while others will be more proactive in handling your finances. When you are choosing a business accountant, you should always ask what recommendations they have for saving your company money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business succeed. Before you choose your small business accountant, you should consider how this professional relationship will ultimately help contribute to, support, and guide your business growth. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to look at an accountant as an integral member of your team. After all, they can play a pivotal role in the success of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business thrive. On the flip side, an inexperienced or otherwise unqualified accountant can be extremely counterproductive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure you </span><a href="https://1800accountant.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose the accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is the best fit for your business, be selective and take your time with the decision. Ultimately, you want to choose an accountant who is within your budget, reliable, reputable, dedicated to supporting your goals, and committed to helping you scale your business (if that’s part of your business plan) and save money. </span></p>

Understanding what business expenses are deductible can help you save money and make it easier to take advantage of deductions going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a quick look at the business expenses that are deductible for tax year 2021, what’s not deductible, and some tips on how to track your business expenses more effectively.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are tax-deductible business expenses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) makes it relatively easy to determine what is and isn’t a deductible business expense. The key is maintaining good records to keep everything organized accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deductible business expenses must be “ordinary” and “necessary.” The IRS defines an ordinary business expense as one that is “common and accepted in your trade or business” and a necessary expense as one that is “helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.” The tax agency further points out that the expense does not need to be indispensable to be considered necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of business expenses include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fees for professional services (accounting, legal, consulting)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising, promotion, and marketing expenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank charges, dues, and subscriptions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (rent, insurance, property taxes, employee commissions, and salaries)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet costs (web hosting, web design, domain names, WiFi)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee education</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Licenses and permits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance and repairs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office costs, utilities, postage, and supplies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications systems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car mileage (56 cents a mile for 2021, increasing to 58.5 cents for the 2022 tax year)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business travel expenses for the owner or employees</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is a business line of credit tax deductible? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the benefits of taking on debt in your business is that this capital is not considered taxable income. For example, if you have a $100,000 line of credit, neither the full amount nor the balance you use is considered business income. The same applies to business loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you cannot deduct your repayment installments as a business expense, you can claim the interest you have paid on the line of credit. However, the interest you’ve paid is only deductible if you have a record of making business purchases with those funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say you pay 10 percent interest monthly on your business line of credit. If you make a $5,000 personal car repair purchase with the line of credit and carry the balance for one month, for example, you cannot claim the $500 in interest you paid on that balance. This is why it’s crucial to keep your business and personal expenses separate. If the car in question can be listed as a business expense — it qualifies as an ordinary or necessary expense related to running your business — then you can deduct the $500. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if you use the line of credit to make an equipment purchase (a capital expense: costs that are part of your investment in the business), you can </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/what-best-method-calculating-depreciation-tax-reporting-purposes.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deduct depreciation costs.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Repairs are typically considered deductible business expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to keep track of what you pay for with your business line of credit so you can maintain a record of which expenses are regular business expenses and which are considered capital expenses. Capital expenses are not tax deductible. If you’re just starting your business, many of your startup expenses are considered capital expenses. We’ll talk about capital expenses in more detail in the next section. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business expenses that are not tax deductible </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that not every expense associated with doing business is fully tax deductible. Nondeductible expenses can include expenses used to cover the cost of goods sold, capital expenses, and personal expenses. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you manufacture products or purchase products for resale, part of running your business will be covering the cost of producing or buying those products. COGS include expenses like the cost of raw materials, including shipping costs, storage, cost of labor to manufacture the product, and factory overhead costs. COGS do not apply if you run a service-based business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as your business only has average </span><a href="https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/what-are-gross-receipts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual gross receipts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (your total revenue) of $26 million or less for the three prior tax years, you are considered a small business taxpayer by the IRS and your COGS are in fact deductible from your gross receipts. This applies to sole proprietorships and single-member LLCs who use Schedule C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are preparing your taxes, you need to separate your COGS-related expenses from other business expenses. These are two different sections of your tax forms. You cannot list COGS-related expenses again as a deductible business expense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your business manufactures products or buys them for resale, the costs associated with this process are not considered deductible business expenses. Instead, the materials, transportation, storage, and labor costs involved are deducted from business income and accounted for separately from deductible expenses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For sole proprietors and single-member LLC owners, COGS is accounted for in the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p334.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income section of your Schedule C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Form 1040). Partnerships and multiple-member LLCs use partnership tax Form 1065. For corporations and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/preparing-s-corp-deadline/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S Corps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, COGS is included in your corporate tax returns, Form 1120 or Form 1120-S under the income section.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Capital expenses </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A capital expense is an expense your business incurs for the company’s future benefit instead of an operating cost needed for daily operations. Examples of capital expenses include fixed assets such as equipment, vehicles, property, and franchise rights. Improvements to assets are also capital expenses (for example, renovating an office space). The costs associated with starting your business are considered capital expenses as well. You can capitalize both the direct and indirect costs of these expenses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company doesn’t qualify as a small business in the eyes of the IRS, COGS are also considered a capital expense. You must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs associated with COGS. Indirect costs can include rent, interest, taxes, storage, and administrative costs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you cannot deduct a capital expense, you can recover some of the costs through deducting depreciation, amortization, or depletion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Personal expenses</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you spend on your family and home life is not deductible as business expenses, which is why it’s so important to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep business and personal finances separate.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you work from home, you can only deduct a percentage of the costs that overlap between your personal use and business operations. For example, while monthly internet costs are considered an ordinary and necessary business expense in an office, the cost of the internet at home is likely a shared business and personal expense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, you’ll need to calculate what percentage of the time you’re using the internet for business versus your personal usage and calculate the cost accordingly to deduct it as a business expense.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you pick up gigs to make extra income, the IRS also has a specific microsite for </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/gig-economy-tax-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig Economy entrepreneurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with tax guidance for those with side-hustles like selling goods online, driving a car for food delivery, or providing contract-based creative services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some previously deductible business expenses are no longer deductible. You can no longer deduct employee transportation benefits you might provide to subsidize commuting costs, transit pass costs, or parking costs. You’re also unable to deduct business entertainment costs that do not include food and beverages. If entertainment includes food and drinks, you can deduct half of the cost of the meal. If the receipt for the cost of entertainment and meal does not separate the charges, the IRS considers the entire cost entertainment, and none of it is deductible.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to track business expenses more effectively </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on top of business expenses is at the core of every successful business operation. Recording and regularly reviewing your company’s expenses helps you identify excessive expenditures, cut costs, and be better prepared when tax deadlines roll around. Try these tips to get your business expenses under control:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Get tech-savvy. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in accounting software and leveraging it to its full capacity can make managing your business expenses less overwhelming. Many software products offer features that are tailor-made for small business owners. The best accounting programs are customizable to your needs, provide excellent customer support, feature helpful apps and integrations that enable automation, and are cloud-based, so you can update expense information no matter where you are.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create detailed records right away. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the headache of trying to track down expenses you made months ago by getting in the habit of recording detailed, consistent records of your expenses when they happen. Keep this information all in one place, preferably your accounting software. Each expense should be recorded with notes, such as “Freelance service, web design” or “Utilities, cell phone” and categorized accordingly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Separate business and personal expenses.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Carefully separate your records and maintain different bank accounts to cut down on any possible co-mingling of business and personal expenses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using personal loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lines of credit, and credit cards to cover business expenses. When you are filing your taxes, having business and personal expenses separated ahead of time will save you time and stress. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Save receipts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether the receipts are paper or digital, set aside a place to keep a copy of all your receipts. Make this a routine that goes along with fully and accurately recording each expense. You never know when your business may be audited. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Use business credit cards.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Using </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could build your business’s credit score, but also streamlines your record keeping since business credit card companies break down spending by category on your statements and usually provide a year-end summary. You can also have your statements directly downloaded into your accounting program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a plan for employee reimbursements.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In some states, such as California and Illinois, businesses are required to reimburse their employees for work expenses like tools, supplies, and travel expenses. To legally reimburse employees, your business needs to create an </span><a href="https://justworks.com/blog/expenses-101-expense-reimbursements-taxable-income"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountable plan.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can deduct the reimbursements as expenses as long as you have an accountable plan that adheres to IRS regulations about what is reimbursement and what is considered </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p15--2022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxable wages or income for your employees. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accountable plan will help you keep track of all your employee reimbursements and the documents associated, like receipts for meals, airplane tickets, and hotels. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">New tax credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, as part of the American Rescue Plan, small businesses could claim refundable tax credits that reimburse them for any time off they granted employees to recover from COVID-19, receive or recover from COVID-19 vaccinations, or manage family issues related to COVID-19. This program was effective until September 30, 2021. If you haven’t already claimed this credit on your quarterly federal tax return, you can do so when filing your 2021 return. There’s more information available about this credit </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-credits-for-paid-leave-under-the-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-for-leave-after-march-31-2021"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the IRS website.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing your taxes as a small business owner can feel overwhelming. Staying on top of your expenses on an ongoing basis and looking into the IRS regulations that pertain to your business well ahead of time can help you manage the process with confidence. </span></p>

That’s great news. Now, how should you spend that windfall to deliver maximum benefits for your business? If you need a little help deciding where the money will have the biggest impact, here are 10 ideas to consider.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrade your website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your website fast enough? The probability of users leaving a website increases by 32 percent if the site takes longer than </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-reduce-your-websites-page-speed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 seconds to load</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Is your website easy to use on a mobile device? For several years now, the majority of </span><a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online searches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken place on mobile devices, not on desktop computers. Do you want to start selling online? Your website is your storefront, so hiring a website design company or expert to update and upgrade your site is a smart move.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not ready to hire permanent, full-time employees, outsourcing can be the perfect alternative. Assess which tasks in your business could benefit from outsourcing and look for independent contractors or freelancers to tackle them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donate to charity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your business already have a relationship with a nonprofit organization or charity? Consider sharing the wealth by making a cash donation to your cause. If you’ve always wanted to get involved with a local charity, use your tax refund as the impetus to get started. (Be sure to talk to your accountant about any effects the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">may have on tax consequences of charitable donations.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in business relationships</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is networking an important part of your sales process? Using your tax refund to pay membership dues for an industry association or networking group can reap big benefits. You could also put the money toward membership in a golf club, country club or other leisure organization where you could hobnob with prospective clients off-duty.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start (or add to) your retirement fund</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a retirement fund, use your tax refund to max out your 2021 contribution. Don’t have a retirement plan yet?  Retirement plan options exist for even the smallest, one-person business. They not only help you prepare for your future, but also give you tax breaks. Learn more about </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3998.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retirement plans for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your mind</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of business is changing at lightning speed, and you need new skills to keep pace. Use your tax refund to pay for courses at community colleges or online courses like those from </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.skillshare.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skillshare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Udemy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can learn everything from accounting and finance to management and leadership.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your health</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are the foundation of your business, so taking care of yourself is vital — but if you’re like most entrepreneurs, you don’t have a lot of spare time for self-care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve the problem by spending your refund on a personal trainer to come to your home a few days a week, a meal delivery plan, or another service that saves you time and boosts your energy levels.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reward yourself</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the money to take a much-needed vacation or to treat yourself to a memorable experience. (Experiences create more lasting happiness than things, studies by a </span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.546.6920&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cornell University professor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found.) For example, get tickets to a play, concert or sporting event you normally wouldn’t splurge on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy or lease new Equipment</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in new machinery, vehicles or other equipment your business needs can have a huge impact on your company’s productivity and sales. Even something as simple as upgrading office equipment like printers and copiers can really streamline your workflow, making your employees more efficient.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a tax professional next year</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was your tax refund really big? As good as it might feel to get that check, it’s not such a great thing: It means you overpaid taxes during the year and let Uncle Sam use your money instead of using it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you did your own business taxes, hold onto part of your tax refund and use it to hire a pro next year. (See our article on the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-common-tax-mistakes-small-business-owners-make/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biggest tax mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small business owners make.)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="478" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Taking-Notes-Using-Laptop-768x478.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="women taking notes" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Taking-Notes-Using-Laptop-768x478.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Taking-Notes-Using-Laptop.jpg 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking on business debt is an effective strategy for financing business growth. Many small businesses need to take out loans or leverage credit to fund their operations, especially when they first start out. The Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that about </span><a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are financed by loans and credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have multiple debts that you’re repaying to different accounts or institutions, you might consider business debt consolidation. Debt consolidation is the process of taking out a single loan to pay off all of your existing debts. It differs from refinancing in that you’re looking to pay off all of your separate debts at once, rather than taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate to pay off a higher-interest loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating your business debt can save you time, so you aren’t keeping up with different repayment schedules for multiple loans or credit balances. With a single interest rate and the right repayment terms, it can also help you save money.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to determine if debt consolidation is right for you</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating loans is not a magic bullet for your financial challenges. The intention is to make repaying your debt more manageable with a single payment due date, a reliable payment amount, and one interest rate. There are a few things you should think about before choosing to consolidate your business debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start, calculate how much interest you’re currently paying on all of your debt. While interest is not the only factor you need to keep in mind when choosing your consolidation loan, it’s great to save yourself some money with a lower interest payment. Interest rates are dependent on your personal and business credit scores, so take that into account when you’re looking into debt consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, figure out if your cash flow will cover your consolidated loan payments. If having multiple repayment dates with differing amounts throughout the month will help ensure that you have enough to cover your bills, it may not make sense to consolidate the loans into one payment that will prohibit you from paying for other expenses on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure that you can afford your consolidated repayment is critical to avoid expensive late fees. Late payments can also take a toll on your credit score, preventing you from getting good interest rates on future loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering business debt consolidation, take stock of your borrowing and spending history. Review your habits and assess whether you need to implement some more effective business spending strategies. Additionally, you should not use loan consolidation to address personal debt. The primary reason for this is tax compliance. Failure to keep your personal and business expenses separate could make it difficult to get financing in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to consolidate your business debt </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several options for consolidating business debt, including bank loans, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, lines of credit, and funding from online financial platforms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a bank loan is one of the best ways to consolidate business debt, qualifying for one can be a challenge. You often need to be in business for several years and have a great credit score. You also need to have strong, proven revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do meet the qualifications, bank loans usually offer interest rates lower than 10% and repayment terms of ten years and under with monthly payments. Be aware that banks typically charge prepayment penalties if you plan to pay your loan off early. Smaller regional banks or banks with great small business advisory programs can help guide your choices and help you determine the most beneficial ways to consolidate and repay your debt. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-1-sba-7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 7(a) loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only SBA loan that you can use to consolidate debt. It’s a flexible funding option you can use for any type of debt. It provides a loan amount of up to $5 million, and repayment terms do not typically exceed ten years (25 years for real estate loans). The interest rate is between 5–10% and you’ll make your payments monthly. There’s no prepayment penalty for loans with repayment terms under 15 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few restrictions to be aware of with the SBA 7(a) loan option: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the loans you want to consolidate has to be eligible under the SBA 7(a) guidelines. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA 7(a) loan payment amount needs to be at least 10% less than that of your current loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to put together a written explanation for each of your current loans for why they don’t have reasonable terms.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the SBA 7(a) loan to pay off your business credit cards as part of your debt consolidation. In the wake of the pandemic, the SBA is also offering the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-08/COVIDEIDL_FAQs-508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which enables you to cover your current regular debt or credit card payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans and lines of credit from online financial platforms</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of traditional financial institutions, other lending options include online financial platforms. These lenders offer loans and lines of credit and are a great choice for businesses that do not qualify for bank or SBA loans. A big plus is online financial platforms make it easy to get a loan or line of credit approved as quickly as possible without jumping through hoops during the application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers both </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">term loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you consolidate your business debt. A term loan can be repaid in installments over a 24 or 52-week plan. Lines of credit allow you to take advantage of as much or as little credit as you need with 12 or 24-week repayment plans. Interest rates vary depending on your business history and the payment term you choose. There are no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Fundbox’s structured repayment plans help you stay on track by requiring you to pay equal installments on a regular basis, ensuring that you pay off your consolidated debt as quickly as possible, without compromising your cash flow. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to look for in a debt consolidation loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing is to ensure you can secure a loan that covers all of the outstanding debts you’re looking to consolidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you compare loan options, make sure you’re aware of any upfront or ongoing costs of your new loan. There may be fees for late payments and paying off the loan early. Other costs could include balance transfer fees, loan origination fees, and annual fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term loans allow you to pay your debt slowly in smaller chunks, making it easy for you to make full payments on time and promoting healthy cash flow. Keep in mind that you may end up paying more interest over time than you would with a shorter repayment period. Understand how cash flow works in your business to get the most out of your repayment terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that low interest rates aren’t always guaranteed and that a low interest rate doesn’t indicate you’re getting a good deal. Shop around for the lowest interest rate you can find, but take into account what the lender is asking for in terms of collateral and guarantees in the case of default. Will your personal assets be on the line? You can always consider refinancing your consolidated loan in the future to take advantage of lower interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important point to keep in mind is how long you’re planning to take to repay your consolidated loan. A low interest rate over a longer repayment period might cost you the same as a loan with a higher interest rate you’re planning to pay off quickly. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing your consolidated loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, maintaining positive cash flow is more important for business longevity than paying back debt as quickly as you can. If you’ve found a loan with a favorable interest rate for a long-term repayment plan, focus on making your regular payments and ensure that your remaining income can cover all of your other regular expenses. Reinvest anything above that into building your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s paramount that you make your payments on time and in full. The purpose of loan consolidation is to make your life in business easier. Regularly paying down your consolidated loan balance keeps your business healthy, improves your credit score over time, and looks great to potential investors, other lenders, or buyers––if you choose to sell your business in the future.</span></p>

Cash flow refers to the amount of cash that comes into and goes out of your business. For example, a sale is a cash inflow while paying business expenses are cash outflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive cash flow helps you run your business effectively. It allows you to pay your expenses on time and seize opportunities to expand your operations or invest resources back into your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with your balance sheet and income statement, is one of your business’ key financial statements, and it helps you assess the health of your business. Both investors and traditional lenders—like banks—look at your cash flow statement to make informed decisions about providing financing to your business. You can use your cash flow statement to understand how your business is doing and to make strategic choices about how to improve your income streams, minimize your expenses, and run your business better. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the three types of cash flows </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three types of cash flows that you’ll see on your cash flow statement: cash flows from operations (CFO), cash flows from financing (CFF), and cash flows from investing (CFI). </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from operations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFO includes the cash flow inflow that comes directly from sales. This type of cash flow indicates whether you can afford your operating expenses. Your regular bills, like rent and software subscriptions, as well as payroll and inventory costs, are the cash outflows that fall under ‘operations.’</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business’ CFO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps you run your business successfully, and sustainably, in the long run. Looking at your net income on your balance sheet is the starting point for calculating your operating cash flow: how much cash do you have available to cover your operating costs? If you aren’t making enough net income to cover your costs, it’s important to look into different ways to finance your business in the short term as you grow your sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from financing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFF is the net flows of cash that are used to finance your business that include debt, equity, and dividends. Understanding your CFF will help you keep track of the ways you’re leveraging financing options such as getting a loan (debt), using a line of credit (debt), or receiving investment (equity). Cash outflows here include interest payments and paying dividends to your investors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from investments </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFI is generated cash flow that is used for investments in assets or securities such as stocks and bonds. This type of cash flow is also related to investing in your business. If you’re investing heavily in business development, training, or research, it’s normal to have a negative cash flow in this category. Positive cash flow in this category happens when you make money on your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining positive cash flow enables you to cover the costs of running your business. Focusing on building positive CFO and CFF allows you to generate the cash flow needed to start creating positive CFI for spending on your business’ growth and investing in strategically chosen securities as you scale your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow vs. profit, cash flow vs. net income</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profit refers to the amount of money left over after certain expenses have been paid (e.g., gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold). There are usually several types of profit listed on a financial statement. Calculating profit in different areas of the business allows companies to see which expenses have the biggest impact on the bottom line. Large profits do not necessarily indicate that your business has a healthy cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net income is referred to as the bottom line and represents your revenue minus all expenses, interest, and taxes. Net income is a single number that encompasses your profits. You can use your net income to calculate cash flow in your business. Understanding your cash flow will help you assess the overall profitability of your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow is challenging for every business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow determines whether your business’ doors stay open. Even well-established businesses might struggle with maintaining positive cash flow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different factors can influence cash flow depending on your business model. Small businesses and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sole proprietors, like freelancers,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often deal intimately with CFO issues such as late-paid invoices and fronting costs for supplies and inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might be charged monthly for expenses like rent and software subscriptions, but you might struggle to ensure that your clients pay their invoices before those bills are due. The project could have generated more than enough revenue to cover those expenses, but if the invoice hasn’t been paid in advance of your bills, you’ll experience negative cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a product-based business, the cost of goods sold (COGS) factors heavily into your CFO strategy. You’ll need to have enough capital upfront to produce the product and there’s often a gap of time between investing in the inventory and getting paid for that inventory. Managing this is an ongoing dance between your financing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re at a business stage where you haven’t looked at financing or investing options, CFO might be your primary cash flow focus. Looking at your CFO will help you determine what types of financing you need and whether raising outside capital will help you reach your business goals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Master Cash Flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much cash flow you need is dependent on how much it costs to run and grow your business. The first step to mastering cash flow is to understand your cash inflows and outflows: assessing what resources you have and whether you’re effectively putting those resources towards activities that generate a return on investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a great idea to check on your cash flow statement on a regular basis. Typically, your cash flow needs to be reported both quarterly and annually. There are several formulas you can use to calculate cash flow, but the formula you’ll want to use to determine the profitability of your business is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/what-formula-calculating-free-cash-flow.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free cash flow (FCF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Free cash flow reveals how much money you have left after covering your costs. That extra capital can be used to expand your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s one of the ways to calculate cash flow using the cash flow from operations listed on your cash flow statement and capital expenditures which you can find on your balance sheet: </span></p>
<p><b><i>Free cash flow = cash flow from operations (CFO) &#8211; capital expenditures</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business model includes invoicing clients, one of the ways you can boost your cash flow is to negotiate strict repayment terms with your clients and take the time to understand their repayment habits. Make sure that your contracts lay out payment terms clearly. If you run a product-based business, it’s important to understand your COGS as you may need to cut costs and keep an eye on the time it takes to be repaid for your investment in inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business loans and lines of credit can help support your cash flow as you grow your business. A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/#h-how-you-could-benefit-from-a-business-line-of-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with additional working capital to help you with ongoing operational expenses like purchasing or producing extra inventory, hiring more team members, or expanding your location space. A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">micro-loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you front the cost of major purchases and enable you to repay that balance slowly over time, making it easier to manage those cash inflows with the cash outflow of paying off the loan.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="474" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Women-Printing-Receipt" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt-.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a profit and loss statement? There are many financial statements that your business should maintain and refer to, key among these is your profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement. But why is it so important, what can you learn from it, and how do you calculate P&amp;L? Below are answers to these and other frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What does the profit and loss statement show?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement is an important indicator of your business’ health – across its lifecycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, it can tell you if you’ve reached break-even point. This is the point at which the total cost of goods produced or sold equals the revenue the business makes. Understanding your break-even point can help you price your products, set revenue targets, and identify missing expenses. It’s also a critical part of your business plan. Investors will want to know at what point you stop losing money and begin to turn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement will also show how your business performs over time; breaking down revenue generated, and expenses incurred. With these insights, you can see how profitable your business is and how much cash is left over after your losses are accounted. These funds can be used to grow your business, pay off debt, or contribute to your salary as a business owner. The statement also informs where you may need to cut costs to reduce losses and drive revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you are an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will use your P&amp;L statement to report profits and losses on your individual tax return. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you calculate P&amp;L?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your P&amp;L statement will draw on the following data points and calculations: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Sales (or revenue) &#8211; Cost of Sales (or Cost of Goods Sold) = </span><b>Gross Profit (or Gross Margin)</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross Profit &#8211; Operating Expenses = </span><b>Net Operating Profit</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Operating Profit + Other Income &#8211; Other Expenses = </span><b>Net Profit Before Taxes </b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Profit Before Taxes &#8211; Income Taxes = </span><b>Net Profit (or Loss)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These terms can be confusing. Let’s look at what each means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The net sales your business made during a certain period. This data point should reflect revenue from your primary business activity but also any gains from other activities such as the sale of assets.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The calculation of all the costs involved in manufacturing or selling a product. These typically include materials, transportation, storage, and labor costs. Knowing your cost of goods sold can help you determine how to price your products to maximize profitability and ensure you’re maintaining sustainable margins. It will also help you identify which product lines may be killing your profitability. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gross Profit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can arrive at this number by deducting the cost of sales from your business’ net revenue.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Operating Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Expenses are the costs incurred in the daily running of your business – from rent to marketing, training to vehicle mileage. What’s included in operating expenses? The costs can be variable (the cost of labor, materials, supplies, wages), fixed (rent), and accrued (expenses that are incurred but not yet billed for).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Operating Profit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The profit that remains once you’ve deducted selling and administrative costs or expenses.  </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Other Income and Other Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These buckets account for any income or expenses that aren’t related to your company’s main business operations. For example, other income could include royalties, dividends, or gains from the sale of property or other capital assets. Other expenses refer to the costs associated with unexpected losses like repairs or tax penalties.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Profit Before Taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are your company’s profits before paying income tax. Find it on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about each of these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and why they matter. It’s wise to consult an accountant or bookkeeper if you need help with these calculations.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do you fill out a profit and loss statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many freely available P&amp;L statement templates that you can use. Search online or use one of many Microsoft Office templates. You may need to create separate spreadsheets to calculate each of the data points before entering them in your main P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use accounting software like QuickBooks or FreshBooks you can generate a P&amp;L statement in just a few clicks based on your accounting data. </span></p>
<h3><b>How often should you update your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a goal to update your P&amp;L statement frequently. This may be once a month or once per quarter. If your business is new, your update cycle may be more regular. This allows you to keep an eye on profits and satisfy the needs of investors. Updates will also be prompted by tax season, a new product launch, expansion into a new geography, or the emergence of a new competitor on the block (if your profits are dropping you may need to shift your marketing strategy). </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you interpret your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sense of your P&amp;L statement is even more important than maintaining one. If you’re struggling to understand what the numbers are telling you, have a conversation with an accountant. They can help you understand where revenue is being generated, any pitfalls to profitability, and where costs need to be cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online accounting software can also support your analysis. Charts and graphs help you visualize key information. You can also drill down to get a more detailed view into transactions associated with each graphic. These reports can also be easily shared with an accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/financial-indicators-review-accountant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Financial Indicators to Review with Your Accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is the difference between a P&amp;L statement and a balance sheet?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a snapshot of what your business owns (its assets) and what it owes (liabilities).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet won’t inform your profitability or cash flow, however, it is the leading indicator of the overall stability and liquidity of your business and is a useful tool for determining how much cash your business has on hand and your ability to fund growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Do you need to maintain a cash flow statement too?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! It’s critical that you maintain both a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a P&amp;L statement because cash and profitability are two separate indicators. Your cash flow statement provides a detailed picture of where the business’s income comes from and where it goes. If your business shows a profit but maintains a weak cash position, these two statements will give an insight as to why.</span></p>

What is not always so clear, however, is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you need to pay taxes </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much you currently owe. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions are often no easier when it comes to understanding how to charge your customer for taxes.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully this article can provide some clarity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some taxing challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently millions of pages of legal tax law on the books, creating challenges for business owners of all stripes. Even those with relatively “simple” business models are often wondering whether they are paying their taxes correctly and on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common challenges faced by business owners is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not to </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-the-perfect-invoice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply taxes to an invoice</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoices often represent a significant portion of all financial transactions. When you issue one, does this create a tax obligation for the issuer? The recipient? Both? Neither?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the answer to this question is one that is highly situational. Whether you need to pay taxes on an invoice will depend on the legal status of both parties involved, the nature of the invoice itself, and a variety of other factors. Having accurate and correctly taxed invoices will help your business improve its reporting and payment cycles, along with other functions like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because applying taxes to an invoice can be difficult for some people, you may want to consider working with a professional accounting firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are wondering how to apply taxes to an invoice, you are certainly not alone. Below, we will discuss the most important things you need to know about applying a tax to an invoice. By taking the time to learn about this important process, you can put your business in a better financial position.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have to put tax on an invoice?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you need to pay taxes on an invoice will depend on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what the invoice represents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the invoice represents a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill of sale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—and, as a result, is subject to sales tax—then yes, you will need to include taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first line of the invoice should include the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">total charges</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including all services and goods that have been rendered. Even if the goods and services have not yet been paid for (and thus qualify as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts receivable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), an invoice can still be used to show that a transaction has, in fact, occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next line on the invoice should include the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax amount</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Separating the taxed amount from the billed amount will be useful come tax season for both the invoice issuer and the invoice recipient. Any tax exemptions or adjustments should also be included. Be sure to include the applicable tax rate, whatever that might be. Most sales taxes are imposed on a state or local level, but other taxes and fees might also apply (and should be included in the invoice).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the invoice should also include any reductions, additions, or other types of changes. This might include a discount, a late fee, and various other types of adjustments. Ideally, your invoice will make it easy for a neutral (outside) party to determine when the transaction materialized and how much has been paid or will be paid in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different types of invoices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of invoices that might emerge over the course of doing business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Invoice: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the standard invoice is usually issued by a business to their client or customer. It should include the contact information for all parties, an invoice number, the corresponding tax information, and explain whether any money is still owed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a credit invoice is issued alongside any crediting transactions, such as a refund for a customer. The amount being credited will be listed as a negative value.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debit Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a debit invoice, also called a debit memo, can be used to make small adjustments to standard invoices. If any taxes are paid or applied, they should still be included.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timesheet Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a timesheet invoice can be used in instances when the individual is getting paid by the hour. This can include consultants, accountants, lawyers, and many other types of individuals. Unless the recipient is employed by the company, you can choose to let them handle the taxes on their own (they might need a 1099 or other tax form).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a transaction generates any sort of immediate tax obligation (anything other than year-end income tax), then the issuer should include all corresponding tax information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate tax on an invoice</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding how to apply tax to an invoice can help your business continue operating with ease. Here is how to calculate tax on an invoice:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step One: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">identify the type of transaction taking place. If the invoice represents the sale of goods or services, you will need to apply the sales tax.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Two:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> determine what the current applicable sales tax is. Your accountant should be able to easily answer this question, but if you are working on your own, be sure to check with all relevant jurisdictions your business is operating in.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Three:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> add the sales tax rate to 1 and multiply by the total sale (example below).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Four:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clearly list the added tax on the invoice, including the total tax, the new total, and the tax rate being used.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you are issuing an invoice for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">200, and the current tax rate is 7 percent. To determine the new total, simply multiply the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 by 1.07 (1 plus the tax rate). In this case, the new total would now be $214.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice tax best practices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying attention to these common  practices may  help your business improve its current financial performance and, ultimately, improve its bottom line.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice Factoring</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring involves selling your outstanding invoices for a significant portion of the current cost. This helps you collect immediately on your invoices and access the cash you need for your business to grow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum Information: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a general rule of thumb, if you are wondering if you should include a piece of information (such as invoice tax) on the invoice, you probably should. It’s better to over-explain than to leave your clients wondering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about Timing: </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you send an invoice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will depend on the kind of invoice you are issuing. This might be after the purchase, after project completion, at specific milestones, or on a predetermined basis. Regardless, be sure that your invoice practices are predictable and clearly explained.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to apply tax to invoice can help your business improve its communication with clients, improve its reporting standards, and also make it much more likely you’ll be able to collect on existing accounts. As long as invoicing remains an important component of the business cycle, it will be important to find ways to enhance your current invoices and align them with industry standards.</span></p>

A cash flow statement is a summary of your company’s incoming and outgoing cash from three main areas: 1) operations, 2) investments, and 3) financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and balance sheet, a cash flow statement can give you a better picture of your business’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including your profitability and spending habits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculate cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may seem tricky, but it’s fairly straightforward in practice. There are two ways to prepare your cash flow statement: the direct method of cash flow and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indirect method of cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct vs. indirect method of cash flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both methods of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/abcs-overcoming-cash-flow-gaps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yield the same total cash flow amount, but the way the information is presented is different. The difference, however, only applies to the operating cash flow. The investing and financing sections present the same way whether you use the statement of cash flows direct method or indirect method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the </span><b>direct method of cash flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you count only the money that actually leaves or enters your business during the designated reporting period. To do that, you start with a blank slate, then add and subtract all your company’s operational cash transactions. These transactions could include receipts from product or service sales, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/simplify-small-business-payroll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">payroll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, rent, supplier payments, or materials expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>indirect method of cash flow</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-accounting-method-business-cash-accrual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accrual accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is when you record revenue and expenses at the time a transaction occurs, rather than when you actually lose or receive the money. Using your income statement, you start with your company’s net income as a base. From there, you refer to the changes on your balance sheet to add and subtract from your net income. Keep in mind that the indirect method accounts for non-cash factors like depreciation, while the direct method doesn’t.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why use the indirect method of cash flow?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Financial Accounting Standards Board generally prefers the direct method </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement of cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both the direct and indirect methods of cash flow are in line with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the direct method can be tedious and time-consuming, which is why business owners tend to prefer the indirect method. Plus, since most businesses already use accrual accounting to record their financial information, using the indirect method to calculate cash flow from operations keeps things consistent. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate operating cash flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business’s operating cash flow is the first section of a cash flow statement. Operating </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how much net cash your business generates from everyday business operations, which is why it’s a good indicator of how profitable your company is. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-planning-for-a-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive operating cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means you’re bringing in more money from your core operations than you&#8217;re spending. Negative operating cash flow, on the other hand, could be a sign that you need to readjust your pricing model, reduce your expenses, or apply for funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The formula for calculating operating cash flow is:</span></p>
<p><b>Operating cash flow = net income + depreciation &#8211; change in assets and liabilities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ll explain how to put this formula into action step by step. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to create a cash flow statement using the indirect method</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use an Excel spreadsheet to prepare your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or check out the resources and templates your accounting software offers. Whichever route you choose, make sure you have your most recent income statement and balance sheet on hand to draw from. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Record your net income and adjust for non-cash expenses</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by recording your net income for the reporting period in question. Calculating net income requires subtracting your business’s expenses, operating costs, and taxes from your total revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, adjust your net income to account for non-cash expenses, like depreciation of your assets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Adjust for assets </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/understanding-balance-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adjust your net income for increases and decreases to your assets. Your assets include things like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/difference-between-factoring-and-receivables-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts receivable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inventory, property, stock, and cash. In general, increases to your assets (except for cash) decrease your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">complete cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while decreases to your assets increase your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, if you buy a commercial property, you accumulate another asset, but the amount of cash you have decreases. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Adjust for liabilities </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you account for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/assets-liabilities-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adjust your net income for changes in your liabilities, like accounts payable, expenses, and debt. Keep in mind that decreases to your liabilities—say, for example, making a loan payment—can decrease your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, increases to your liabilities in the form of credit—like adding a vendor payment to accounts payable—may either increase your cash flow or keep it steady. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 4: Include cash flow from investing and financing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To finish off your cash flow statement, you’ll need to include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your investing and financing activities. Investing activities could include buying or selling property or equipment, or issuing or buying back common stock. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-get-working-capital-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section accounts for activities like making debt repayments and selling company stock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net change in your cash flow is the sum of all three sections of your cash flow statement. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate operating cash flow using the direct method</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use the direct method to calculate your cash flow from operations, you’ll need to review all your cash transactions in a given period of time. Your business’s cash transactions fall into one of two groups: cash receipts (what you receive in cash) and cash payments (what you pay in cash). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash transactions can include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash received from customer sales or payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash paid to suppliers or vendors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash payments for operating expenses (like payroll, rent, utilities, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash payments for taxes </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash received from interest, tax refunds, or other activities </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding your total cash receipts and subtracting your total cash payments will give you your net cash flow from operating activities. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your cash flow statement to get ahead </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cash flow statement is a crucial component of your company’s collective financial statements. And regularly reviewing your financials can give you a better idea of what your business is doing right, and what you may need to improve upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, for example, you discover you need more cash flow to cover operational expenses, consider applying for a Fundbox </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=blog_directindirectcashflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">line of credit</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re approved, you can get funds as soon as the next business day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure where to start, here’s how to learn more about the importance of tracking your expenses—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how to do it right. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should you track your business expenses?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business expenses is the first step to improving your profitability. When you know where your money is going each month, you can make more informed decisions about your spending </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> develop more effective </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps with the following areas:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monitoring your expenses helps you maintain healthy </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and create more accurate cash flow forecasts. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Money leaks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When you regularly review your spending, you can more easily identify areas where you might be losing money. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be able to create stronger revenue forecasts, which can help you set more realistic sales goals.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Taxes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping a careful record of your expenses throughout the year makes it easier to maximize your tax deductions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>ROI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking your expenses—and measuring the outcomes of those costs—is a good way to determine your ROI for each cost. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Budget:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tracking your expenses is key to creating and sticking to your business’s monthly, quarterly, and annual </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budgets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which business expenses should you track? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business expenses refer to any costs related to running your business. That includes operating expenses like software and </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as expenses related to goods and production, such as materials or storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For tax deduction purposes, the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS defines business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as costs that are “ordinary and necessary.” That means any business expense you want to deduct should be a normal and essential part of maintaining operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expenses you track will vary slightly depending on your industry and business model, but in general it’s a good idea to keep tabs on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilities </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office IT</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional services </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and advertising </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software hosting </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service subscriptions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee salaries and benefits </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business travel </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business vehicles and mileage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office meals </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to manage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking your business expenses doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a good system. Before you choose one, though, set yourself up for success by taking the following steps: </span></p>
<h3>Separate your business banking from your personal banking.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already separated your personal and business financial accounts, now is the time to do it. Having a designated </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and business credit card makes it easier to categorize and account for your various business costs. </span></p>
<h3>Learn how to digitize your receipts.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save time and stress come tax season, it’s smart to get into the habit of digitizing and organizing all your business receipts. As you pay for business expenses—whether it’s gas for your delivery vehicle or updated inventory management software—take a few minutes to save and file your receipts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For paper receipts, try using a receipt scanning app to upload a digital copy to the cloud. For receipts that come via email, you can either screenshot the receipt or save a PDF copy of it. From there, make sure to label your receipts and file them in easy-to-find folders on a cloud-based drive. </span></p>
<h3>Create categories for your expenses.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to categorize expenses for small business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> costs is crucial. When you organize your expenses into categories, it’s easier to see patterns in your spending, identify unnecessary costs, and figure out how to adjust your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by making a list of your various </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fixed and variable business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then jot down a note or two to describe each one. As you go down the list, you’ll start to see natural categories emerge. Here are just a few examples: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Office: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">electricity bills, water bills, telephone costs, office supplies, and office equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Marketing and advertising:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software subscriptions, direct mailers, website hosting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cost of goods sold: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">materials, inventory storage, packaging, labor</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 ways to track your business expenses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few methods you can use to categorize and record your business expenses:</span></p>
<h3>1. Create and update a spreadsheet</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re well versed in Excel or if you don’t have a lot of business expenses, you may want to use a spreadsheet to record your spending. You can either create your own tracking sheet or use one of Excel’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business expense tracking</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> templates. You may want to include columns that specify the following: type of business expense, amount paid, vendor or company paid, date, purpose for the cost, and any relevant notes or details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that while tracking expenses via spreadsheet is an affordable, accessible option, it’s not necessarily the most secure or accurate method. It’s easy to make errors when manually inputting information; plus, if your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically update to the cloud, you risk losing vital business information if your computer crashes. </span></p>
<h3>2. Hire an accountant</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to take a more hands-off approach to expense tracking, consider hiring a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a full-time staff member or on-call consultant. You’d still have to supply your accountant with information, invoices, and copies of your receipts, but the person you hire could  take over the daily categorization and tracking, then generate monthly or quarterly reports for you to review.</span></p>
<h3>3. Invest in expense tracking or accounting software</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using accounting software, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budgeting apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or tracking systems is one of the simplest ways to ensure accurate expense tracking. Most software platforms integrate with your business bank account and automatically categorize and update your expenses, so you don’t have to spend time inputting information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget planners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and accounting systems also generate a weekly, monthly, or quarterly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so you can see real-time data about your spending whenever you want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To decide which software system will work best for your business, think about your budget, expense tracking needs, and short and long-term business goals. There are countless expense tracking options out there, but here are some of the best for small businesses: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>QuickBooks: </b><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accounting/track-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an all-in-one business accounting platform that handles payroll, expense tracking, and online payments. You can connect all your bank and payment accounts to the platform, scan business receipts directly into the app, and see your expenses organized all in one place. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mint: </b><a href="https://mint.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good option for freelancers or sole proprietors who want a simple, straightforward way to track their expenses. You can set your budget within the app, create categories for your expenses, and monitor your spending on the dashboard. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>FreshBooks: </b><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/expenses-and-receipts-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects to your bank account or credit card to automatically sort and update your expenses. The platform also lets you take pictures of your receipts and mark certain expenses as billable for easier invoicing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expensify:</b> <a href="https://use.expensify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a tracking app that’s especially well-suited for business travel. You can scan your receipts, track mileage, and connect to your accounting system or business credit card. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your expenses monthly </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you use an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense tracking app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or accounting software, it’s still important to review your expenses every month for errors and insights. Taking a closer look at your expenses is a great way to understand your cash flow, make more accurate sales forecasts, and stay within your budget. </span></p>
