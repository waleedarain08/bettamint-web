										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_427998631-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="house painting" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_427998631-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_427998631.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about opening a house painting business? That’s great news! Starting a painting business can be a very rewarding venture. But before you pick up your paintbrush and dive straight into painting the best houses on the block, let’s look at what it actually takes to start a painting business. From creating a solid business plan to getting the right team on your side, there are a lot of important steps to take before officially opening your painting business. Let’s dive in!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is starting a painting business a good idea?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be! If you have the skillset to get the job done right, offer good customer service, and are strategic, then starting a painting business can be a great investment in your future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, opening a painting business doesn’t have too many overhead costs and isn’t too expensive. Starting a painting business shouldn’t cost more than $2,000 to get going. While that is a lot of money, startup costs can be much higher for other types of businesses. Because your startup costs won’t be too high, you will be able to turn a profit fairly quickly once you book your first job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you live can play a big factor in how lucrative your painting business can be. If you live in an area with high housing prices and with residents that have extra money to invest in home repairs, then you shouldn’t have any trouble finding work at fair rates. Homeowners associations often encourage and may even require homeowners to refresh the paint on the outside of their homes every few years. This means that if you keep your customers happy, they may keep coming back to you whenever they need a touch up. Drumming up new business is half the challenge, so if you can secure repeat customers, you’ll be off to a great start. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do paint company owners make?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much you’ll make owning your own house painting business will depend a lot on how you choose to run your business. There’s no one clear answer to the question of “how much do paint company owners make”, so consider asking yourself a few questions that will allow you to gauge your unique income potential. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you do all of the work yourself or will you hire workers to pick up some of the slack? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many jobs do you plan to take on? Will you be able to invest in advertising? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the demand like in your area?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do other house painters in your community charge?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve decided you want to move ahead and start your own painting business, there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Started with Your House Painting Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for the best way to start a business, getting organized is a great place to start. Let’s look at some must-have steps you need to take to learn how to start a painting business.</span></p>
<h3>Create a business plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you dive into starting a painting business, you need to sit down and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a solid business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can act as a roadmap to success. Having a well-thought out painting business plan can provide clarity and focus, while keeping you super organized. Every good business plan should contain:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Executive summary</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Company description</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Market analysis</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Description of offerings and value propositions</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marketing and sales strategy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Financial plan and profit potential</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Short-term and long-term business goals</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Appendix </span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Make it legal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve written a robust business plan, it’s time to make things official. You’ll want to make sure your entire business is run above board, so confer with your accountant for advice, which may require you to take the following steps to legitimacy:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Register your company with your local and state government. Unlike corporations, LLCs or some other legal entities, sole proprietors and independent contractors do not have to register with your state’s office of Secretary of State. However, some states require you to register your business name, such as a fictitious or assumed business name, with your county clerk, registrar or recorder.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply for an EIN. This is your business’s “social security number” and is necessary to file taxes and hire employees. If you’re a sole proprietorship, you don’t have to have an EIN, but you may find you want one. For example, you can use your EIN instead of your social security number as your taxpayer identification number, which can give you some much needed peace of mind if you work with a lot of clients that require you to provide one for tax purposes. Your accountant can point you in the right direction. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply for any business licenses or forms of insurance you’ll need to operate your business legitimately and safely. These needs will vary on a state and more local level, so make sure you check in with your local chamber of commerce if you need help understanding what you have to register for. If you’re hiring workers, having workers compensation insurance will be a must.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Find Funding</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can afford to self-fund your new painting business, then you can skip ahead to the next section. But if you need a little help in the financing department (which many people do), then you may want to consider taking out a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cover your startup costs. Buying supplies, purchasing insurance, paying for advertisements, and hiring staff can all get pricey. Don’t be afraid to look into your financing options to get the ball rolling. </span></p>
<h3>Hire staff or contract workers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not expecting to paint entire houses on your own, are you? Once you’ve got your business set up, it’s time to figure out whether you want to hire employees or use subcontractors instead. If you choose the former option, you’ll have to buy equipment and supplies for your own workers to use—but you’ll retain control over your business. If you choose to </span><a href="http://paintingbusinesspro.com/how-to-sub-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use subcontractors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who are essentially professional freelance painters, you won’t have to buy materials—but you’ll lose some control over your business.</span></p>
<h3>Find the right supplies</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you’ve decided how you’re going to staff your business, it’s time to stock up on supplies. You’ll need brushes, rollers, painter’s tape, ladders, sanders, caulking tools, rags, cloths to avoid drips and </span><a href="http://www.sherwin-williams.com/home-builders/products/catalog/categories/equipment-supplies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll obviously need to buy paint too.</span></p>
<h3>Market your services</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You now have everything you need to start painting houses, so start marketing your business. Set up a Facebook page, talk to your friends and family members to see whether anyone they know needs work, and put up fliers around town advertising your business. Once a customer bites, you’ll have to </span><a href="http://paintingbusinesspro.com/how-to-estimate-exterior-paint-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide an estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the work they need. Formalize an agreement, repeat the process and see how many houses you can paint.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash Flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s more to it than just painting houses. For example, like any other small business owner, those who own house painting companies aren’t immune from cash flow problems. When the cash river of a painting business runs dry, you’re unable to buy supplies, market your business and pay contractors and employees. You may have a hard time making insurance and tax payments too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow problems can materialize for a number of reasons, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs may take longer than expected. A job you think can be completed in five days might take eight days. This pushes back your other jobs, delaying those payments, too.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers might not pay on time. Though in a perfect world, they’d pay you right away, it might be weeks or even months before customers settle their bills.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment and supplies may be lost or damaged. A bunch of paint could get ruined or you could lose a box of brushes and other equipment, forcing you to repurchase supplies you hadn’t budgeted for.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accident could occur. One of your employees could accidentally break a window at a customer’s house, causing you to incur unforeseen expenses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government regulations may hit your bottom line. There’s a lot of talk these days about raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. Maybe your business plan is built on the fact you can pay college kids $12/hour to paint for you during the summer. Should the minimum wage rise to $15/hour, you could be in a jam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that you aren’t completely powerless over your cash flow situation. In fact, by taking advantage of new financial tools, you’re able to solve your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/pay-small-businesses-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—before they start.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conquering Cash Flow and Growing Your House Painting Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of spending your time waiting for customers to pay their bills, you can use an </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the money you need to grow your business—and fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you connect your accounting software to Fundbox, your business can be evaluated based on the data in your accounting software. If approved for credit, you can choose which invoices you want to clear (up to your credit limit). Fundbox can then transfer that amount into your account as soon as one business day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You then have 12 or 24 weeks to repay,plus a small fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most parts of the country, house painters have a short window to operate in: the summer! Given that, there’s no sense in waiting around for checks to come in before you can move on to the next project. Thanks to Fundbox, you might not have to.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1721510737-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Man wearing PPE cleans home kitchen" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1721510737-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1721510737.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cases of COVID in the U.S continue to rise, the demand for professional cleaning services is experiencing a dichotomy. While </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for commercial janitorial services has spiked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> residential cleaning services have seen </span><a href="https://academy.getjobber.com/covid-19-impact-on-home-service-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revenues fall by 35%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to the same period in 2019 and 45% since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a home cleaning business, it’s likely you’re feeling the pinch. With millions of us now working from home, concerns about infection risk have caused many Americans to suspend or cancel their cleaning services. A </span><a href="https://www.cmmonline.com/news/housekeepers-still-bearing-the-brunt-of-pandemic-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the National Domestic Workers Alliance found that 72% of residential housekeepers reported they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, sanitation and hygiene is more important than ever. Even leading epidemiologist, Dr. Fauci, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/how-fauci-5-other-health-specialists-deal-with-covid-19-risks-in-their-everyday-lives/2020/07/02/d4665ed6-b6fb-11ea-a510-55bf26485c93_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the only person who enters his house beside his wife and himself is his cleaning lady. In fact, cleaners are considered an essential service in many states and were exempt from lockdown orders. Yet as those orders have steadily lifted, residential cleaning companies still face an uphill struggle retaining existing clients and attracting new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a house cleaning business, now is a critical time to act. Here are some tips and strategies for growing your business during this unprecedented time (while protecting your employees and clients).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look after your employees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees are on the frontlines of efforts to help control the pandemic, yet many </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/domestic-workers-chartbook-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-demographics-wages-benefits-and-poverty-rates-of-the-professionals-who-care-for-our-family-members-and-clean-our-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic workers lack labor protections or healthcare coverage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can protect them should they get sick on the job. So, it’s important that every effort should be made to protect their health – and the health of your clients.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen employees regularly on their recent health conditions and provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. Emphasize that PPE should be discarded after each visit and fresh ones donned before cleaning the next home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although your cleaning protocols may not change much, train your cleaning teams on </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC reopening guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Position your services as “contactless”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create policies and procedures that eliminate all contact between your cleaning crews and your customers. For example, you might establish policies whereby your clients are required to vacate the home or occupy a room that isn’t being cleaned while your team is on-site. If a client or their family can’t leave the home, request that they also wear masks and maintain a social distance of a minimum of six feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re quoting new business, use a video call or ask your prospects to send photos so you can provide a virtual estimate. When you schedule your visits, set defined appointment times so that your clients know when to expect you and can work around your visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to communicate these processes to your customers. Create a video or email to share and reassure families what your company is doing to keep everyone safe. Develop an FAQ that outlines the steps and precautions you are taking and share it on your website, blog, via email, and social media.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjust your marketing message</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a pandemic, your client’s priorities have changed and so should your messaging. Sanitation is more important than ever. To inspire customer confidence, stress the health benefits of a clean home and the measures you are taking to protect them during the cleaning process – the right disinfectants, PPE, contactless service, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the pandemic, our busy lives have made home cleaning services more of a necessity than a luxury. And now is no different. With entire families working and schooling from home, find ways to stress the emotional benefits of a clean home. Think Marie Kondo – a clean and organized home can destress and clear the mind – while keeping surfaces free from bacteria and viruses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/small-business-coronavirus-impact-poll-june#latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 80% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have pivoted from their usual service offerings. Consider your customer base and demographics and think of ways to boost your business now and for the future. Is there an opportunity to offer deep cleaning services using tools such as disinfectant foggers and ultraviolet light? Perhaps you could target clients with high-traffic homes such as vacation rentals or simply those who are hygiene conscious. Survey your existing client base to gauge interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about partnering with a carpet or soft furnishing cleaning company and offer discounts for bundled services? Then give those clients an incentive to keep coming back with a discount off their first regular cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look to your community. Are there opportunities to expand into your services into commercial cleaning (without overextending your team) such as newly opened organizations such as churches or bars, restaurants, and retail stores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some other timely </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategies for pivoting your small business during coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply for a business line of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow is a challenge for small businesses at the best of times and especially difficult in 2020. As you look to sustain and rebuild your cleaning business, one way to have a reliable source of funding is to </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for a business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike term loans, credit decisions can be made quickly. With Fundbox, for example, credit decisions can be  made in minutes and funds may be transferred as soon as the next business day. </span></p>
<p><b>“Fundbox gives real money in our business account so I can make payroll while waiting for checks to come in. It’s been an amazing lifesaver.”</b><b><br />
</b><b>Kimberly Beckford, owner, OZGLO Cleaning Company</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funds can be used when needed—to meet payroll, purchase supplies and equipment, or to fund a marketing campaign. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you make your weekly payment, those funds are available to borrow—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no need to reapply. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Build out your site’s SEO and functionality</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your site’s search engine optimization (SEO) can pay dividends in new leads and conversions. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, involves more than plugging in the right keywords. Boosting your site’s visibility means creating a corner of the internet that’s engaging, informative, and easy to read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, a business website is the most used distribution channel for marketers, according to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HubSpot’s 2020 state of marketing report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People aren’t just looking for information—they’re looking for a better user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s been a while since you updated your website, consider a refresh. The following steps can help improve functionality and SEO:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a web designer to improve your site’s mobile performance. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number one technical SEO tactic marketers use to improve a business website is optimizing the site for mobile use, according to HubSpot. Making a website </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile-friendly </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes down to two factors: aesthetics and accessibility. You may need to improve the page loading time, for example, or update the landing page graphics and layout so they translate better to a small screen.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revamp your landing page. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clean, visually compelling landing page can entice potential clients to stick around. Instead of trying to cram in as much information about your firm and services as possible, work on stripping it down to the essentials. Include a brief description of who you are and what you offer, followed by a video or infographic, then a call-to-action that invites people to take advantage of a free phone consultation.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a chatbot. </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatbot function</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your business’s website is an easy way to draw people in while offering customer service help. You can program chatbots to greet site visitors, answer questions about your firm’s services and fees, and direct them to your contact information. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Get press exposure</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appearing in local or national media outlets gives you a chance to establish credibility with current clients, increase brand awareness, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promote yourself as an authority on a certain subject. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To connect with reporters and writing looking for lawyers to interview, try the following: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for email newsletters like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HARO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProfNet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then set aside 15 minutes each day to read the source requests and respond to journalists. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research local and national news stories that pertain to your field of law. As you read, take note of the reporters and journalists who interview subject matter experts and regularly cover the topics you can speak to. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email reporters with helpful story suggestions or angles. For example, if a local reporter recently wrote a story about small business owners who need to beef up their insurance plans, you could reach out offering insight from a legal perspective. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Increase your content marketing efforts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a lawyer, your greatest asset is your specialized knowledge. Doling out that knowledge in small—free—bites is a good way to raise brand awareness, attract potential clients, and build credibility with your target clientele. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do you do it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most successful avenues is content marketing. In fact, 66% of companies surveyed in a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 HubSpot report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said content marketing was either very or extremely effective for their brand, leading to improved SEO rankings and increased website traffic and subscriber growth. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can take a variety of forms—including videos, social media, and email—but the most popular tends to be written content. Blogs and articles, for example, are a simple way to educate clients and demonstrate your knowledge, while case studies give potential clients a peek into your process and track record. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you already do some form of content marketing, but to be successful you have to put your audience’s needs first. What are your clients’ biggest concerns? What are their burning questions? Think about how you can answer their questions or offer guidance through your content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a divorce attorney, for example, you could write a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of blog posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how couples can successfully navigate contentious divorce proceedings. Or, if you advise small businesses, consider writing an ebook that explores how businesses can protect themselves against potential lawsuits during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steady revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consistent clients is smart marketing.

Janitorial businesses make a significant contribution to the U.S economy. <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> by IBIS World shows that the U.S. janitorial market amounts to more than 904,000+ businesses; 1,846,488 employees; and annual revenues of $53 billion, and that&#8217;s expected to dramatically increase in 2020.</p>
<p>While growth in this sector was only moderate at 1.6% annually, the <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demand for cleaning businesses</a> has exploded since the outbreak of COVID-19. Here are ten tips for getting a share of that pie and grow your janitorial business.</p>
<h2><strong>10 Ways to Grow Your Janitorial Business</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Start by Looking at Your Current Customer Base</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to grow your janitorial business, your current customer base can tell you a great deal about why your business is a success, where it needs to grow, and what goals and tactics you should spend your time on. This little bit of research is an essential first step to growth that will help you repeat your wins rather than adopt a scatter-gun approach to growth.</p>
<p>Think about where your current customers come from. What were the lead sources? Was it from referrals, word of mouth, advertisements? Which tactic worked best? Is it a model you can repeat?</p>
<h3><strong>2. Know What Your Customer is Looking For</strong></h3>
<p>Take your customer research to the next level by building a picture of their needs. Never assume that your growth plans align with what your customers want or you risk going after a market opportunity that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Get feedback from current and even prospective customers to see what they look for when selecting and retaining a janitorial service. It&#8217;s never always just about price. It could be reliability, quality of work, flexible schedules, employee conduct, and so on. The industry is increasingly moving towards green cleaning services (which IBIS states as a key opportunity for janitorial businesses)—is there a need in your market?</p>
<p>Then consider how your competition stacks up against these needs. How do they compare to your business? Is there a gap you can fill?</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stop and Think About Your Business Vision</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been in business for a while, there&#8217;s a good chance that the day to day &#8220;busyness&#8221; of running a business has taken your eye off your wider goals. As you think about growing your business, reflect on what you want that business to look like.</p>
<p>Do you want to take on larger clients? Or, perhaps, expand into other sites, campuses, or locations that your existing clients have? (This is low hanging fruit and could be a win-win if you can add some sort of incentive, such as a discount). Determine the types of businesses you want to go into.</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps you might see more success in diversifying your offerings? For example, could you add window cleaning or HVAC maintenance to your services? Your vision will help steer your growth strategies.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Plan Your Marketing in Chunks</strong></h3>
<p>When did you last see any marketing or branding excitement from a janitorial business? Not that often, right? Once you have a vision and a strategy, think about your marketing plan. This will give you a path to follow that can help you grow your janitorial business.</p>
<p>Your plan should be informed by your goals and your research, and it is best approached in chunks. If you are trying to reach customers who don&#8217;t know about your business, you&#8217;ll need some awareness tactics in there (advertising, PR, etc.). You&#8217;ll also need a plan for once they are engaged (i.e. they want to learn more about you)—this could include case studies, customer references, a short YouTube video explaining your core values and service offerings, etc. Finally, find a way to keep marketing through your happy customers using a referral program. For more tips, check out these tips from my fellow blogger, Rieva Lesonsky: Creating a Marketing Action Plan.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Create a Target Customer List</strong></h3>
<p>As you think about your marketing tactics, refer again to your vision. What defines growth for you? Are you hoping to expand your service delivery radius? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, auto dealerships, malls, corporate offices, etc.). This will help you determine who to target in your marketing.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Good Old Direct Mail Still Works</strong></h3>
<p>If you intend to run a direct mail campaign (always a good idea if you&#8217;re trying to reach a specific person), create a short list of target companies within your service area. Find out who the facility manager is and build a spreadsheet of all your target contacts. Plan around your budget, but be prepared to send 3–5 mail pieces and stagger your messages. Start by introducing yourself and your company, then send a brochure, follow it with a piece that links to success stories on your website, include a small giveaway like a fridge magnet with your contact info, then ask for a meeting, perhaps offer a free trial—think of it as a drip effect.</p>
<p>Keep at it. If you didn&#8217;t have much success, &#8220;rinse and repeat&#8221;. Come up with new marketing pieces, consider tweaking your message, and start the cycle again six months later.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Knock on Doors</strong></h3>
<p>Door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services, an industry which, as I mentioned earlier, often flies under the radar of traditional, big-splash marketing campaigns. Refer to your target contact list, perfect your pitch, and create a special offer to lock them in.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Get Out in the Community</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to grow your business, be more active in the community in order to build brand recognition. Find ways to participate at town fairs, festivals, and chamber of commerce and networking events. You might even consider sponsoring a fun run or charity event.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Have a Consistent, Defining Message</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, perhaps one of the most important things in marketing is having a consistent marketing message. You can&#8217;t be all things to all people, so carefully consider your differentiators and your target market as well was what you&#8217;ve already successfully done for other companies as you craft your message. Back it up with a story—explain what led you into this line of business, expand on why you&#8217;re different, and how this permeates your mission and what you do. The story is a useful starting point to crafting your sales and elevator pitch, website messaging, advertising, and other marketing tactics (brochures, flyers, social media) that you use to build awareness.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Get Quick Funds with a Line of Credit</strong></h3>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup">business line of credit</a> </strong>can help you with payroll, supplies, and overhead expenses while you&#8217;re waiting to get paid. It can also arm you with the short-term capital you need to grow. You can use these funds to launch a marketing plan, hire new employees, expand or open a new location, or many of the other growth tactics mentioned above.</p>

Professional services firms in particular routinely come up against </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/avoid-5-major-cash-flow-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow constraints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hiring difficulties, and schedule setbacks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with business lagging due to COVID-19, many of the obstacles these companies face loom even larger right now.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a professional services company, here are the five most common challenges you might be facing—and what you can do to overcome them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a professional services firm, maximizing the number of billable hours per employee is critical to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and increasing profits. “Time is the inventory of service-run businesses, and it’s a perishable resource that goes bad by the second,” said Nick Bideshi, the CEO of </span><a href="https://wearebluemeta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Meta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital marketing agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our biggest challenge is missing out on billable hours because of the fast-paced working environment we have,” said Michael Hammelburger, the CEO of </span><a href="https://thebottomlinegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bottom Line Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that helps business owners reduce their business expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The time spent on calls and online messaging with clients outside of work,” he said, “or the time spent traveling for consultations are just some of the hours that get neglected when consultants forget to log them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neglecting to log billable hours can cost your company thousands of dollars in revenue, but it’s only part of the issue. The larger concern is making sure employees have enough billable work each week. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximizing your employees’ billable hours comes down to better organization and project management. Start by reviewing your record-keeping methods. “We have a dedicated team that administers a software tool that captures billable hours according to our billing guidelines,” Hammelburger said. “We’ve improved compliance and accuracy by 90% and avoided writing off billable hours just to fast-track payments from clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, consider your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project management techniques</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How do you typically assign projects? Are some employees overworked while others sit idle? You may need to change your teams or distribution style to ensure everyone has enough billable work throughout the week. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Hiring and training </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-hiring-challenges-and-solutions-for-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a professional services firm can be a catch-22. You likely need to hire to help offset your project load, but hiring also creates more work for you and your team in the short-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to constantly balance hiring employees and onboarding clients,” said Bideshi. Not only do you have to find, vet, and interview candidates, you also have to train them, which requires a significant amount of non-billable time and resources. Plus, depending on your new hire’s experience level, it can take weeks or months for that person to become billable and start generating revenue for the company.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent lost revenue and job opportunities, it can be helpful to try to shorten your company’s time frame for hiring and training, while simultaneously increasing the checks and balances in the processes. Consider clarifying the scope of work in your job description, casting a wider net for candidates, or conducting more thorough interviews. These steps can help you find more experienced candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to training, the right </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help speed up the process. “We’ve automated 90% of our onboard training for non-management employees by using software solutions to hold courses meant for internal purposes,” Bideshi said. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Acquiring new clients </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining your existing clientele while searching for new clients is a perpetual challenge. Even if you have ongoing client relationships, it’s still important to incorporate new clients to stay current, boost your revenue, and keep your team agile, said Sarah M. Williams, the founder and director of </span><a href="https://816nyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">816 New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a brand strategy and communications agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plus, you don’t want to be too reliant—especially now during COVID-19—on only a few relationships, since things are so much in flux.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting new clients doesn’t just happen with time and patience—it also requires resources. You may have to budget for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new marketing initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spend money on advertising campaigns, and carve out time for consultations and proposals. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on revamping your marketing plan. “We have content marketing campaigns that run from our website that are meant to acquire leads, specifically those with communications strategy needs,” Williams said. Content marketing efforts, as well as online ads and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email nurture campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help bring more potential clients to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising any free services you offer is also a good idea. “We do a free 30-minute consultation,” Williams said, “which often turns into a proposal process if the lead seems strong enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also want to source potential clients from your network. Look into virtual conferences or discussion panels, or consider implementing a referral program to incentivize past and current clients to spread your name around. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Planning for ongoing demand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a professional services firm means balancing your time between working on current projects and planning for future work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A client’s budget can end, scale up, or start abruptly for various reasons,” said Bideshi. “In a post-COVID-19 world, these ups and downs seem more violent than they did prior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t plan for periods of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/10-ways-to-maximize-winter-downtime-in-your-construction-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downtime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or increased demand, certain areas of your business can suffer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a marketing agency, for example, “Demand for the design team could exceed its capacity, meanwhile the strategy or writing team doesn’t have enough work,” Bideshi said. This can throw off your project timelines and billable hours, both of which ultimately affect your profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Demand issues arise from not having consistency in the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/creating-a-great-omnichannel-b2b-customer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sales funnel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Bideshi. “This can be due to overspecialization in the types of firms a company works with, or improper business development processes.”  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to draw consistent leads and generate steady demand is to improve your sales funnel, Bideshi said. “A key factor to consider is the monthly or yearly client churn based on revenue, not number of accounts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, try using data to determine the strongest and weakest points in your sales funnel. If, for example, you know most of your clients leave your website after visiting the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-critical-ways-landing-pages-help-grow-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landing page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, work on brainstorming ways to increase engagement at that stage. That might involve adding a video to the page, tightening the copy, or directing potential clients to a free consultation or discount on their first service. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Waiting for client payments</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve always faced as a self-employed SEO and website designer is the amount of time it takes some companies to pay for the service they&#8217;ve requested,” said Jase Rodley, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://dialedlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dialed Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a website design and SEO agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many professional services firms end up waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for their client payments. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the issue. According to a recent report, </span><a href="https://group.atradius.com/publications/payment-practices-barometer/usmca-2020-late-payments-rise-as-recession-bites.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">late payments affect 43% of the total value of B2B invoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued in North America this year. What’s more, the total value of payments overdue by more than 90 days has doubled to 13%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow thins out quickly when you’re waiting for receivables, making it tricky to cover operating expenses, let alone budget for growth initiatives like hiring or investing in new technology. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a handful of strategies you can use to keep </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steady. One option, Rodley said, is to charge a non-refundable deposit on your services. “It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives you some wiggle room for your bills without needing to be paid fully.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to set up a payment plan. “We auto-bill our ongoing clients and put our project work on an installment plan that’s also auto-billed, so we always get paid,” Williams said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also negotiate with your suppliers or vendors to extend the deadlines for your payables, Hammelburger suggested. Just make sure you have a good relationship with those vendors; otherwise, you might risk burning a bridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re having a difficult time trying to speed up your receivables or delay your payables, consider turning to an online lender. At Fundbox, we offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming your firm’s challenges comes down to implementing more efficient systems—for everything from sales to hiring. If you’re struggling with an area of your business, take some to regroup and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategize for your success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if you need help with cash flow, consider applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/#how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

In an industry that from 2014 through 2019 enjoyed only </span><a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/janitorial-services-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moderate growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 1.7% annually,</span><b> coronavirus is now causing a 75% spike</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taking-it-to-the-cleaners-coronavirus-spurs-spike-in-demand-for-jobs-to-sanitize-america-2020-03-12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new job openings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March compared to a year earlier, according to online jobs marketplace ZipRecruiter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This demand is especially true for commercial office spaces—a challenge compounded by shelter-in-place mandates or work-from-home company policies in a growing number of American cities. Eventually, those workers will have to return, perhaps as soon as early April, 2020, with the expectation that their offices are safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, thousands of retailers across the U.S. are seeking cleaning services to disinfect their stores and help lessen customers&#8217; fears. Since the outbreak, ServiceChannel reports </span><a href="https://chainstoreage.com/janitorial-services-stores-rise-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatic increases in requests for facilities services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by retailers so far in 2020, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Luxury retailers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 84% increase in janitorial cleaning and carpet shampooing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Big-box retailers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 35% increase in HVAC air filter cleanings and janitorial services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Grocery stores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 18% increase in janitorial cleaning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Restaurants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 53% average increase in cleaning, primarily in janitorial and kitchen</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to this the sudden and huge demand in janitorial work orders at </span><b>healthcare-related offices  (up 66%)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not to mention the upcoming unmeasurably-high need for residential cleaning services.</span></p>
<h2>A mission to serve, not just to grow</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a janitorial, cleaning services, or facilities management company, this is a critical time to act. Beyond the obvious and unprecedented </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-your-janitorial-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity for growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you&#8217;re on the front lines to help control a global pandemic. How is your business prepared to meet this demand—and its many challenges—right now? Here is a list of key steps and things to consider regarding the current and future services you provide.</span></p>
<h2>1. Hire the right people</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even under the best circumstances, </span><a href="https://www.janitorialmanager.com/blog/hire-to-hire-janitorial-employees-rock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruiting quality janitorial employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be one of the toughest aspects of your business. Unemployment in the cleaning industry is already at a </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taking-it-to-the-cleaners-coronavirus-spurs-spike-in-demand-for-jobs-to-sanitize-america-2020-03-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record low of 2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the candidate pool isn&#8217;t very large, according to Indeed Hiring Lab. Plus, these  require more skill and may even involve technician licensing requirements. Here are some tips to help improve and speed your hiring process:<br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mobile-friendly job listings.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> First, you should post easy-to-find openings on your website, which should ideally be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimized for mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since about 90% of people use smartphones to search. Google&#8217;s indexing algorithm penalizes websites that aren&#8217;t mobile-friendly, making them appear much lower in search results. Plus, </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/mobile-job-search/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that mobile-friendly can increase the number of job applicants by 11.6% compared to job listings that aren&#8217;t from other employers that aren’t mobile-friendly.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Simplified job applications. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Glassdoor, &#8220;Lower-income workers complete job applications at lower rates and take longer to complete each application.&#8221; Using a mobile device makes this even worse, so asking them to self-describe their skills and education on an online form could deter many applicants. You may want to consider providing the option of simply attaching a resume.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Posting to job sites. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many popular websites like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, JobVite.com, LinkedIn.com, and Craigslist. However, many such sites require employers to pay fees as high as $999 per month.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cleaning associations. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also try posting jobs on any cleaning associations you&#8217;re a member of (or consider joining), such as:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.issa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ISSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The Worldwide Cleaning Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ijcsa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IJCSA </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(International Janitorial Cleaning Services Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.icrassociation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (International Cleaning and Restoration Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.nca-i.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (National Cleaners Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bscai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BSCAI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Building Service Contractors Association International)</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer incentives. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With competition high and applicant numbers low, you may find it helpful to stand out by offering incentives to attract quality people. For example, you could advertise competitive wages, signing bonuses, or longer vacation allowances. Some businesses also offer current employees referral bonuses.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Purchase the best possible equipment and supplies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combatting something as deadly serious as coronavirus demands not scrimping on the quality of the tools you use—from disinfectants to application devices to personal protective gear for your employees. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use only </b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>CDC approved or recommended procedures</b></a><b> and </b><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>EPA registered hospital-grade disinfectants</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that kill bacteria and inactivate viruses.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Strictly follow </b><a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>current published OSHA standards</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for how infected materials are cleaned, disinfected, and properly disposed of as biohazard waste.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide OSHA-approved, </b><a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/personalprotectiveequipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>fully encapsulated personal protective equipment (PPE)</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and full-face respirator masks, to be worn at all times by your certified cleanup technicians.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Develop and follow strict </b><a href="https://www.emergency-response-planning.com/blog/bid/74836/An-Expert-Guide-to-Demobilization-and-Post-Incident-Recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>demobilization processes</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your equipment, trucks and waste storage areas.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consider high-tech equipment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some cleaning services have found it effective and time-saving to use such technologies as </span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2020/03/15/coronavirus-springfield-covid-19-fear-cleaners-high-demand/5036211002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrostatic sprayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to coat surfaces with disinfectant or even </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXZjLk_4Hk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-powered ultraviolet light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to kill bacteria and viruses on hard-to reach areas. But of course, always follow recommended CDC and EPA guidelines.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every cleaning is different in its details,&#8221; says </span><a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/property-management/cleaning-commercial-properties-to-fight-covid-19-this-is-no-time-to-cheap-out-103420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Biorisk Advisory Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of Forensic Operations, Jeff Jones. &#8220;But the essential process depends on three factors: the chemicals applied to the surfaces, the equipment used to apply them and whether personnel are properly trained to follow CDC guidelines.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>3. Start marketing your services</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at times of high demand, such as after natural disasters or during the coronavirus crisis, marketing is essential to your business success. Develop a marketing plan and invest in producing the materials you need to inform and be seen by the clients who require your help and to stand out from the competitors in your area—especially those who may be cheaper and/or less reputable than your own company. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Have a plan. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing plan doesn&#8217;t need to be extensive. However, such a plan can help focus your thoughts, efforts, and budget to help get the maximum results with minimum waste. Here is a quick guide on </span><a href="https://www.smallbizdaily.com/how-to-write-a-marketing-plan-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a marketing plan for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Know what makes you different.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Carefully consider your differentiators and your target market. Do you have expertise cleaning particular kinds of job sites, such as healthcare facilities, schools, factories, or residences? Craft your company mission statement and &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; that&#8217;s clear, powerful, and consistent across your website messaging, advertising, and other marketing assets (brochures, flyers, social media).</span></span></li>
<li><b>Create a target list. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know what geographic areas you can best serve? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, retail shops, restaurants, corporate offices, etc.)? Determining this ahead of time will help you better target your marketing and save money.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Get out into the community.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are many traditional ways to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-brand-cleaning-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build brand recognition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and raise awareness of your essential services. Consider new signage for your building or your service vehicles. Out-of-home advertising (such as billboards or bus shelter ads) can also promote your business on an automatic and ongoing basis. Consider radio or TV advertising to reach a larger audience. You may want to participate in business fairs and local chamber of commerce and networking events. Finally, door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Help with the cash flow you need to help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the ramp up to preparing to meet such a demand for essential services can sometimes challenge your available cash on hand. If you’re an established janitorial or cleaning services business, Fundbox may be able to help, with a <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

After all, if you operate out of your home, you keep your costs low and there are few expenses to offset your taxable income.</p>
<p>However, there are several important, and easy-to-overlook, tax deductions that freelancers, independent contractors, and sole proprietors can maximize before the year draws to a close.</p>
<p>Here are eight tax deductions to be aware of—and how to take full advantage of them.</p>
<h2>1.  Home office tax deductions</h2>
<p>It might be hard to believe, but millions of home businesses aren’t taking advantage of this important deduction. That’s crazy, since it has the potential to save you a ton of money every year you operate your business from home.</p>
<p>According to the SBA, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2018.pdf">50 percent of all businesses are home-based</a>, while 60 percent of all firms without employees (i.e. freelancers and sole proprietors) also work out of their homes. Yet, the IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-home-office-deduction-often-overlooked-by-small-business-owners">reports</a> that small business owners often overlook this deduction.</p>
<p>What is the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/home-office-deduction">home office deduction</a>? In simple terms, it allows you to deduct the business expenses associated with your office space, such as rent, mortgage, and utilities. There are two methods of calculating the deduction—the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/simplified-option-for-home-office-deduction">simplified method</a> (introduced in 2014 to encourage more home businesses to take advantage of the deduction), and the regular method.</p>
<p>If you choose the simplified option, you can claim $5 per square foot of the area of your home that is used for business (up to 300 square feet). Alternatively, the regular method requires you to track your actual expenses such as utilities, mortgage, rent, any home repairs, home depreciation, etc. and then calculate your deduction based on the percentage of your home devoted to business.</p>
<p>In order to claim the deduction, the IRS requires you to use a certain area of your home solely for the purposes of trade or business. It’s an important distinction. For example, if you use the kitchen table as your workspace for six hours a day, then clear it away for meal times with your family, you can’t claim the deduction because you aren’t using that space “exclusively” as a home office.</p>
<p>If, however, you have a separate room or space in your home that is clearly defined as an office and is used solely and “regularly” for business purposes, then go ahead, make that claim!</p>
<p>The IRS has more <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/home-office-deduction">information about the home office tax deduction</a> and how to choose the right option for your business.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10239" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10239" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10239" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_589946126.jpg" alt="Working father with a baby, working from home" width="500" height="359" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_589946126.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_589946126-768x551.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10239" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Ah, the joys of working from home!</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>2.  Business supplies and tech expenses</h2>
<p>Any business, including freelancers and sole proprietors, can write off the cost of purchasing business supplies and technology if they are used exclusively for a business purpose. This includes furniture like your desk, chair, computer, printer, as well as software licenses.</p>
<p>You can also deduct the cost of printer paper, your notebooks, and so on. Plus, if you drive to the store to make those purchases exclusively, you can <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates">deduct the mileage</a> incurred.</p>
<p>If you need any office equipment or furnishings, you might want to purchase those before the end of 2018 as you may be able to use these purchases as a tax deduction this year.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to do an audit now of all your purchases in 2018 so that you have the information you need before you complete IRS Form 4562 and attach it to your 1040 tax return.</p>
<h2>3. Legal and other professional services</h2>
<p>If you used the services of a third-party to help you with legal matters such as incorporation, bookkeeping, or accounting, you can usually deduct these costs—if they qualify as “ordinary and necessary” expenses (meaning they are common and appropriate).</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions. For example, some of the fees paid to professionals are not deductible. This may include fees paid to professionals who also provide you with personal tax advice.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you use the same tax preparer or bookkeeper to manage your business and personal finances, then these costs may overlap and are hard to account for come tax season. This is one of the reasons why it’s important for freelancers and sole proprietors to<a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/"> separate their personal and business finances.</a></p>
<h2>4. Mileage and vehicle expenses</h2>
<p>Do you use your car to visit clients, meet prospective customers, or attend business-related events?</p>
<p>If so, you can claim the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates">mileage tax deduction</a> for miles driven during 2018 in your business or personal vehicle.</p>
<p>If you <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc510">use your vehicle exclusively for business,</a> you may also be able to deduct its entire cost of operations, including oil changes, gas expenses, tires, insurance, registration fees, and more.</p>
<p>Use this time to make sure you’ve kept <a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc305">stringent records</a> of your vehicle use for business purposes. The IRS requires that businesses maintain a log of the miles traveled, date of the trip, start and end location, business purpose, and so on. Keep a notebook or spreadsheet, or even better, use a mobile app to automatically track and log your mileage as you go. <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/oa/selfemployed/">QuickBooks Self-Employed</a>, <a href="https://www.hurdlr.com/mileage-tracker">Hurdlr</a>, <a href="https://www.stridehealth.com/tax">Stride Tax</a>, and <a href="https://www.mileiq.com/">MileIQ</a> are a few options out there that make this easier to do.</p>
<h2>5.  Advertising and marketing costs</h2>
<p>Did you do any marketing for your business this year or make marketing-related purchases such as social media monitoring tools or email marketing software? Even if it only made a small dent in your budget, the costs add up, but they are deductible.</p>
<p>Other deductions you may be able to take include monthly website fees, PPC advertising such as Google AdWords, printing costs for your business cards, marketing automation software, as well as traditional print marketing.</p>
<p>Organize those costs now and record them on your Schedule C during tax time.</p>
<h2>6. Insurance (including healthcare premiums)</h2>
<p>Many clients require that freelancers purchase general liability or professional liability insurance (aka malpractice or errors and omissions insurance) to protect their interests. This can be a significant cost, in the region of $400-$1,000 depending on the coverage you decide on. But you can deduct the premiums you incurred this year so don’t overlook this important deduction.</p>
<p>Another important deduction for self-employed freelancers and sole proprietors in this category is your healthcare insurance premium. If you pay for healthcare insurance entirely out of your own pocket using after-tax dollars (no government subsidies or employer share) you may be able to write-off your costs.</p>
<h2>7. Cost of materials</h2>
<p>If your business revolves around producing goods, for example, jewelry, arts and crafts, and clothing, you may deduct the cost of materials under the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses#costs">cost of goods sold</a> (COGS) category. This covers expenses such as the cost of raw materials and storage.</p>
<p>COGS is a required part of your business tax return and can reduce your taxable income. Knowing your COGS can also help you determine how to price your products profitably and help you ensure you’re maintaining sustainable margins. It will also help you identify which product lines may be killing your profitability.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10240" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10240" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1045891222.jpg" alt="Team dinners, client entertainment" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1045891222.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1045891222-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10240" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Don&#8217;t forget that client entertainment and meals with a business purpose may be deductible, saving you money at tax time.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>8. Client entertainment and gifts</h2>
<p>If you can prove that a meal or coffee with a client has a business purpose, you can deduct 50 percent of the cost. For example, the occasion must involve active discussion about business, such as plans for next year, new product releases, etc. Don’t forget you can also deduct the cost of mileage to and from the restaurant!</p>
<p>This year did see the rolling back of a popular deduction in this category. If you’ve claimed client entertainment, such as a trip to the ball game in past tax years, the new Tax and Jobs Act of 2017 <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/274">eliminated the deduction for client entertainment, amusement, or recreational activities</a> such as sporting events.</p>
<p>Finally, if you purchased gifts for clients during the holidays, you can deduct up to $25 per person, per year. If you’re looking to maximize your tax deductions, it pays not to spend more than this amount on each person.</p>
<h2>Before you claim</h2>
<p>The new tax law has brought sweeping changes and many businesses remain confused as to what it means to them. In addition to ensuring you have all your deductible ducks in a row, now is also a good time to make an appointment with a tax attorney or CPA (also tax deductible) so you can better understand the <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/new-tax-law-implications-business-owners/">implications of the new tax law</a> on your deductions and filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_242808139-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="How to grow pool cleaning business" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_242808139-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_242808139.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Did you ever ask yourself: “When is the right time to get new clients for my pool maintenance business”? The answer is probably, right now (Early spring, late winter times). We want to make it easy for you to pick the best ways to grow your pool maintenance business right away. So we broke this guide in to several key categories.</p>
<h3>Local marketing opportunities for pool maintenance business owners</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Partner with local pool supply stores</strong>. Talk to pool supply stores in your area. Ask if you can leave your business cards or brochures at the checkout counter. Be sure to offer to return the favor by recommending the pool supply store to your customers.</li>
<li><strong>Get your pool business listed on</strong><strong> local search directories</strong>. When pool owners look for pool maintenance companies, they typically look for one close by. Getting your business listed on <a href="https://www.google.com/business/success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google My Business</a> for example, can help put you in front of local pool owners when they search for pool maintenance businesses nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize your website for local search</strong>. Upgrade your website&#8217;s SEO by adding locally relevant keywords. For example, &#8220;pool service in beverly hills&#8221;, or the words &#8220;pool maintenance near me&#8221;. Add a map to your site so that clients know that your pool service company is local. This may help your website come up higher in search results when people near you look for pool cleaning services.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Business development opportunities for pool cleaning companies</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reach out to a new market</strong>. If you service residential pools, expand your customer base by marketing to property managers at apartments, condominium complexes, motels, and hotels.</li>
<li><strong>Buy an additional route</strong>. One very effective way to expand your pool maintenance business into a new territory is to purchase a nearby route from another pool service provider. Be sure to do your due diligence before you sign on the dotted line. Investigate how many of the customers are long-term clients, their payment histories, and any potentially problematic pools.</li>
<li><strong>Upsell</strong>. Offer existing customers additional goods and services to compliment their pool maintenance services. This may be reselling new pool accessories, chemicals, garden furnitures, or anything else that will help clients make the most from their pool. Your customers will feel more valued, and you&#8217;ll make more money.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Overlooked marketing channels to help grow your business</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid of direct mail</strong>. Even in the digital era, direct mail is an effective way to grow your business and get new customers&#8217; attention. You&#8217;ll need to find a mailing list of local homeowners with pools, then send them postcards or flyers with an enticing offer to try your service.</li>
<li><strong>Turn your employees and vehicles into mobile billboards</strong>. Every time your truck is parked outside a customer&#8217;s house, or when your pool technician is standing on the porch talking to a customer, it is an opportunity to raise awareness for your business. Using eye-catching uniforms, and tagging your vehicles with your company logo, phone number, and URL prominently visible will help build your local pool service brand.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Leverage referrals to get new clients for your pool maintenance services</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customer referrals</strong>. Your clients loves you. That&#8217;s what makes them the best advertisement for your pool service. Ask them if they would recommend your pool services to their friends and neighbors who might need great pool cleaning services. You may also consider offering a referral incentive, such as a free month of pool cleaning or a discount on next month&#8217;s service.</li>
<li><strong>Online reviews count</strong>. Get listed on online review and rating sites such as <a href="http://yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp</a> and <a href="https://www.angieslist.com/research/swimming-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angie&#8217;s List</a>. Complete your listings with relevant information about your pool maintenance business, and encourage your customers to review your business. Link to your reviews from your website and promote them on social media.</li>
<li><strong>Socialize online</strong>. More than three-fourths (77 percent) of <a href="http://aquamagazine.com/news/nespa-releases-results-from-2016-pool-spa-industry-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pool business owners in the Northeast Spa &amp; Pool Association</a>&#8216;s annual industry survey use social media to market their businesses. Share useful tips, before-and-after pool maintenance pictures, and related summer fun content to spark interest in your services. (See more <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-marketing-ideas-pool-business/">marketing ideas for pool maintenance businesses</a>.)</li>

In this article we will review some handy ways to turn lifestyle blogs, social media and other outlets to boost sales and profitability and help Etsy store owners sell more handmade goods like artisanal arts and crafts, clothes, soaps, pet supplies, or even food items.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re looking to <em>grow sales for a handmade Etsy business</em>, here are few useful tips.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Your Etsy store has a &#8220;Story&#8221;- Tell it</strong></h2>
<p>More than ever, consumers are looking to connect with the person they&#8217;re buying from and understand the story behind the product. For example, my dog has food allergies, so I end up avoiding the mainstream commercial dog food producers in favor of smaller producers of natural treats. A treat is a treat to a dog, but, for me personally, I appreciate that the entrepreneurs behind the product share the same values as me, the same challenges in finding quality dog food, and have channeled love into what they do. I know this because they make a point of telling their story on their website.</p>
<p>In fact, storytelling is incredibly important when selling handmade goods and can help boost sales. What are the origins of your product(s)? What inspired you to create it? Look for ways to incorporate storytelling into your overall messaging – whether it&#8217;s in your Etsy profile, your own website, blog, and flyers.</p>
<h2><strong>2. What makes your Etsy store different?</strong></h2>
<p>Your customers desire unique products. An integral part of storytelling is communicating what makes your product different. Whether it&#8217;s unique ingredients, your environmentalism, philanthropy, All of this reinforces the value and &#8220;specialness&#8221; of your items.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Focus on your specialized niche. </strong></h2>
<p>You can&#8217;t be all things to all people. By keeping your product line small and your market targeted, you can market more wisely.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Etsy store pricing. Do you homework. Be bold.</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2015-03-consumers-handmade-products.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a> the Journal of Marketing, consumers are willing to pay a little more for handmade goods, up to 17% more. Does this mean you should automaticaly mark up your prices? No. You must compare your products to relevant competitors and make sure your pricing is competitive. If you do charge more, make sure it is clear why through your story. Your values. What you believe in. How you&#8217;re different. Tell your story such that it is clear why you charge a bit more for your superior product and service. If a customer can find something comparable elsewhere, chances are they&#8217;ll follow their pocket book. Unless your story is compelling enough. Then they may follow their conscious.</p>
<p>So what are some of your options? It really depends on your goals.</p>
<p>Scaling a handmade business by profit is possible. You&#8217;ll just need to put some thought into your pricing. If your goods are truly one-off, like a wedding ring, then your clients may tolerate a higher price point, giving you the flexibility to apply a higher profit margin. You could also look to accelerate your business growth by volume. Keeping a lower price point while focusing on selling more by adding employees, scaling your production line, and selling at more outlets, like fairs, farmer&#8217;s markets, and retail stores.</p>
<p>Whatever your strategy, do your market research. See what similar items are selling for on sites like Etsy, and don&#8217;t forget to check the seller&#8217;s reviews to see how much they&#8217;ve sold of that item recently. If they aren&#8217;t shipping much, then they may be priced too high.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Invest in Photography</strong></h2>
<p>Your product photos can make the difference between a sale or a lost customer. If your products don&#8217;t change much with each batch you produce, consider hiring a professional to photograph your line. If each item is unique, invest in a decent camera, lighting, and a photography class.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Reconnect with your Customers</strong></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve purchased many times from Etsy, yet never heard from the seller again. It&#8217;s an oversight that can leave your customers feeling unappreciated. Etsy sellers should take a cue from their competitors and look for ways to keep customers engaged and coming back. This is especially important since it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to get found on Etsy.</p>
<p>Of course, this is easier said than done. Sites like Etsy have clear policies that prevent sellers from sending follow-up messages to their customers.</p>
<p>One way to get around the problem is to subscribe to a third-party email marketing tool, obtain your customer&#8217;s consent to add them to your email list and <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-market-your-business-with-an-email-newsletter/">start a newsletter program</a>. To do this you&#8217;ll need to ask customers if they want to opt in when you email them to confirm their order.</p>
<p>Another simple way to stay connected with your customers on Etsy is to engage with them in a conversation pre- and post-sale. Be responsive to queries, show an interest in their needs, and follow-up before they move on to another seller.</p>
