										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="DNAArticle-HollyOng" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1357366_DNAArticle-HollyOng_Op2Yellow_042922.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homemade food has the power to connect people with their culture and create a thriving community around both new and familiar cuisines. Small businesses in the food industry play a unique role in shaping our neighborhoods — and our palates. For Holly Ong, co-founder of Sibeiho, building a sambal sauce brand is about bringing the flavors of her Singaporean childhood to the North American market with recipes made for seasoned foodies and busy home cooks alike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last few years, hot sauces have taken their rightful place at the head of the kitchen table. </span><a href="https://www.eatthis.com/news-most-popular-hot-sauce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-four percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans put hot sauce on their food. A deliciously spicy, relish-like sauce, sambal is poised to take the condiment aisle by storm, much like its cousin </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sriracha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sibeiho’s collection of sambal sauces are made from recipes Holly and her co-founder, Patricia Lau, inherited from their families. The pair prioritize local ingredients, creating small batches of sauce from their commercial kitchen in Portland, Oregon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through her journey from working in Nike’s marketing department to putting on supper clubs for friends and family, and eventually starting the Sibeiho brand, Holly has a lot to share about building a thriving business on a foundation of passion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a recipe for success</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sambal is the pesto of Southeast Asia, with a range of variations across Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Each region and household has its own take on the recipe, but key ingredients can include garlic, onions or shallots, and chili peppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holly and Patricia found that Singaporean foods were harder to find in the U.S. (which Holly attributes to there being fewer immigrants from Singapore than other Southeast Asian countries). To get their fix of their favorite foods, the pair started running supper clubs for friends and family featuring beloved Singaporean dishes — with a side of homemade sambal. The sambal was a major hit with their guests and Holly and Patricia sensed that they were on to something.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the sambals stocked in grocery stores are filled with artificial ingredients, and Holly and Patricia saw an opening in the market for a sauce with a homemade touch. It was important to the pair that they offer sambals that are as fresh and healthy as the sauces their aunts and grandmothers made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Holly’s major considerations when starting the brand was ingredient </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">availability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Oregon and Washington happen to be the largest producers of onions in the U.S. which enabled Holly and Patricia to source this essential ingredient locally, something that was also important to them. Easy access to high-quality organic onions also allowed Sibeiho to continue to scale. With a reliable source of this ingredient, Holly is confident that they can continue to grow while relying on their local onion crops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural industry ecosystem in Oregon has also been beneficial for supporting their business development. Holly and Patricia leveraged experts at food science programs at the universities in the state to help them develop shelf-stable sauces from their home recipes. They also participated in </span><a href="https://www.builtoregon.com/accelerator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built Oregon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer product startup accelerator where the Sibeiho team was able to access mentorship and business support.</span></p>
<h2>Building a passion-driven business</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with customer validation: test ideas (and recipes) with a potential customer base and see how they respond.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore resources when it comes to professional development, including local accelerators and university or college programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider all avenues for funding the business and prioritize investing in growth, even if it means strategically leveraging debt. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pivoting from corporate to kitchen</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Sibeiho is Holly’s second career. Before starting the company, she worked for Nike in brand management and bringing products to market. However, after years of working for a Fortune 500 company, Holly was looking for more personally meaningful work. She and Patricia — who she was working with at Nike — bonded over their homesickness for Singaporean food, and Holly found that making and sharing the cuisine she loved fulfilled that desire to do something she was passionate about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holly’s job at Nike involved customer validation and understanding what consumers were looking for. This corporate skill set transferred seamlessly into her work as an entrepreneur. Her experience helped her see an opportunity to capitalize on her culinary talent while she and Patricia were running their supper clubs for fun. The supper clubs also provided an avenue for customer validation and established an audience of sambal converts who were likely to spread the word about the sauce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we chose sambal over running a restaurant or making something else was that it’s the condiment that we would have in our fridge to do a very quick meal, to not have to think very hard, to create something healthy to feed the family,” Holly says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting to create consumer packaged products rather than expanding their supper club also helped the company stay flexible during the COVID-19 pandemic. While </span><a href="https://pdx.eater.com/2021/3/22/22345126/sibeiho-market-sambal-takeout-singapore-pdx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their supper clubs were canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sibeiho continued to sell sambal as well as takeout </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes — multi-tiered lunch containers similar to tiffins used to carry small meals. Customers signed up for weekly emails with the latest menu and were able to pick up the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes from Sibeiho’s Portland storefront. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> boxes and sambal fit perfectly into a market flooded with increasing demand for ready-made foods. One of Holly’s young customers said that her mom had been putting Sibeiho’s sambal into crockpot chicken meals, a dish that had become a family favorite. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">takeout</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">boxes were also popular with parents overwhelmed with caretaking while working at home through the pandemic. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a place on grocery store shelves</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, Holly and Pat attended virtual trade shows to begin the process of getting Sibeiho sambals into grocery stores.  “Food is a very personal choice,” Holly says. “We were asking consumers to try a product that they&#8217;ve never seen. We needed them to [take] this leap of faith with us to try something new.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As luck would have it, since restaurants were closed during the lockdown, home cooks were more inclined to try new recipes and seek out unique ingredients. The pandemic conditions propelled interest in sambal while Oregon’s foodie culture created an environment where local grocery retailers like Market of Choice and New Seasons were excited to carry Sibeiho sauces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that Holly wishes she had done differently while managing the business through the pandemic was leveraging </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tingkat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takeout boxes provided most of the revenue for the business while Holly and Patricia worked to get Sibeiho out to grocery retailers. Holly was hesitant to take on debt, but she learned that she could use smaller loans to cover cash flow and invest in equipment and supplies the business needs to continue to expand. Taking on a small business loan in the future will allow Holly to purchase more commercial kitchen supplies and get started on new projects without waiting for the capital to come in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sibeiho is a labor of love that honors childhood memories and the joy that comes from bringing new cultural cuisines to a hungry customer base. Starting this business has allowed Holly to reconnect with her roots and engage with her community through food. With a continuous learning mindset, Holly and her team plan to uncover better ways to drive their business forward and make sure that Sibeiho sambal is soon a kitchen staple across the country. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1353664_DNAArticle-ShannonRoss_01_042122-1-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Shannon Ross Blog article 2" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1353664_DNAArticle-ShannonRoss_01_042122-1-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1353664_DNAArticle-ShannonRoss_01_042122-1.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have the power to transform their communities for the better. In Shannon Ross’s experience, being an entrepreneur has empowered him to advocate for the marginalized community he belongs to: the population of previously incarcerated people, also known as system-impacted individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon is the co-founder of D’s Trucks, a trucking business he started with a childhood friend in the spring of 2021. However, the company is just one facet of Shannon’s overarching mission to support his fellow system-impacted individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is also the executive director of </span><a href="https://thecommunitynow.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an organization he started while still incarcerated. The Community is dedicated to helping system-impacted individuals fulfill their potential and decreasing the stigma associated with having a criminal record. In addition, Shannon is a consultant with </span><a href="https://paradigmshyft.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paradigm Shyft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a firm that provides education about equity and inclusion practices for hiring, teaching, and working with system-impacted people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon believes that when employers embrace the humanity of people with criminal records, they can change lives and shape their communities for the better. Here, Shannon shares his experiences re-entering the workforce after being incarcerated, how he helps others do the same, and what small business owners can do to make a difference in their own communities by investing in system-impacted individuals. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-entering the workforce with a criminal record</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his 17 years in the Wisconsin prison system, Shannon was committed to working and furthering his education despite incarceration. Throughout his sentence, Shannon spent time </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannon-ross-b0378717a/details/publications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing about his experiences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and building a Buddhist meditation practice which led to the opportunity to design and run a coping skills program at the Stanley Correctional Institution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major challenges Shannon faced as an inmate was completing his university education, which he had begun before his arrest. He faced many systemic obstacles in his pursuit of a Bachelor of Arts in business administration, which he detailed in </span><a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/shannon-ross-college-behind-bars/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article for the Boston Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of these challenges, Shannon’s family stepped in to help him search for funding and courses that he could take while in prison. This ongoing support and his commitment to his studies enabled him to graduate in 2017. Toward the end of his sentence, he won a fellowship to a </span><a href="https://uwm.edu/nursing/academics/msp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master’s program in sustainable peacebuilding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the School of Nursing at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He began his first semester a week before he was released. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon’s graduate program fellowship supported his transition back into the workforce and enabled him to earn an income for going to school. During the transition, he also continued to expand his work through The Community. Shannon’s experience with overcoming adversity as he prepared for re-entry into the workforce has made him particularly passionate about ensuring that people who are still incarcerated get the support they need through </span><a href="https://thecommunitynow.us/pre-entry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community’s pre-entry resources. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months after being released, Shannon connected with his childhood friend, Brian Adams, who had recently left his job and was looking to start his own business. In March 2021, the two began operating D’s Trucks with Brian behind the wheel and Shannon overseeing business development.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Transforming community through business</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move past stereotypes and get curious about how the business can make a positive impact on an individual’s life. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap into a wider talent pool by providing opportunities for upskilling and apprenticeship to system-impacted individuals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivate an empathetic workplace with a culture of connection and understanding that encourages employee loyalty. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uplifting system-impacted individuals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the imperatives of D’s Trucks is </span><a href="https://dstrucksllc.com/about-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing employment opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for other system-impacted individuals. This includes prioritizing hiring previously incarcerated people as well as providing business development support for those with criminal records who are interested in starting their own trucking companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work goes hand-in-hand with Shannon’s advocacy work through The Community’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correcting the Narrative Campaign</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and extends to his consulting practice at Paradigm Shyft. Through Paradigm Shyft, Shannon helps educate businesses on what previously incarcerated people need from their employers to attract, retain, and thoughtfully manage workers who are system impacted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon believes that there is a wealth of untapped talent among those who have a criminal record. Based on his extensive experience as a community leader who deals with many people with criminal records, Shannon has seen firsthand the character development that individuals experience while in the prison system. “There&#8217;s a significant level of potential, a great level of humility, and oftentimes, a high level of willingness to be on a team and move forward in life,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon knows that when employers see system-impacted individuals as people with unique skill sets and valuable perspectives to bring to the table, they </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-ways-attract-recruit-new-employees-great-resignation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stand to gain loyal, driven employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The general bias toward [the label of ex-convict] overlooks the fact that people who are incarcerated are usually very hungry to come out and get their life going,” says Shannon. “In this group, in particular, they&#8217;re very open to being given that chance and recognize that this is something they should hold on to. They respect the opportunities they’re given; they&#8217;re not entitled all the time. They&#8217;re willing to communicate and deal with [challenging] situations that other people may not be willing to tolerate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other small businesses can have a significant effect on their communities when they choose to hire system-impacted individuals. Shannon emphasizes that “when you have people who are getting a good wage and have autonomy in their job and have a sense of self-respect, they&#8217;re going to be better in their neighborhoods and with their families, which is what we all want.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses looking to support workers in the system-impacted community can start by providing training programs or apprenticeship opportunities that allow those whose job-related skill building has been interrupted by their time in prison. From a human resources standpoint, another key area to focus on is engaging in company-wide communication about destigmatizing employees with criminal records and ensuring that these team members feel welcomed, understood, and respected. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivating empathy in the workplace</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shannon’s experiences in prison made him a humble leader with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deep empathy for employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an attitude he hopes to instill in other small business leaders in his community. Shannon’s frustrations about being an employee at the mercy of the emotions of his managers were mirrored by interactions he often had with security staff while in prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being incarcerated and dealing with security staff every day who have so many traumas and difficulties — they’d take it out on us,” Shannon recalls, “And so, I love being in a position where I can say, ‘Hey, I do have [things] going on in my life, but I&#8217;m never going to bring that to you. And I&#8217;m going to listen and I&#8217;m going to be open.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of his experiences, Shannon is committed to showing up for his community, employees, and consulting clients with a willingness to treat people with exceptional respect. “Every single person you deal with every day is going through something. We should just try to deal with each other as individuals in the moment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach underpins Shannon’s foundational desire to help people improve and heal, regardless of their background. In his own life, he’s seen how transformative having compassionate support from family and community can be for making lasting change for the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I call myself an inevitability,” Shannon says. “I was given things that made it very, very unlikely for me to not succeed. When you offer that support to an individual, you&#8217;re giving them the nourishment to grow into their potential, and they&#8217;re not likely to fail.” His mission is to give people the care they deserve to reach their full potential and the resources they need to make their success a certainty, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have the opportunity to push systemic change forward with simple steps that make it possible for individuals from marginalized communities to thrive. Focusing on finding talent that can bring innovative ideas, team spirit, and a new approach to the business — rather than giving into stereotypes — enables small businesses to differentiate themselves and get ahead. Above all, cultivating an empathetic, inclusive workplace improves the communities your business serves, contributing to a better world for all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re talking about</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to Know Your Customers Day</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a quarterly event recognized on the 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of each January, April, July and October. Consider it an opportunity to not only get to know your customers better but to also think about how you can enhance the customer service experience overall. The outcome? How does repeat business and the development of a strong customer base sound (</span><a href="https://khoros.com/blog/must-know-customer-service-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">because data indicates that this will be the result</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few ways you can enhance customer experience (with the ultimate goal of winning new customers and solidifying relationships with existing ones) on Get To Know Your Customers Day, and all the days that follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be strategic about free consultations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In service-based businesses, free consultations sometimes seem par for the course. Unfortunately, free consultations often fail to convert prospects into clients because the consultations are nothing more than thinly veiled sales pitches. If you run the type of small business known for offering free consultations—like a hair salon, a personal training studio, a photography business or a tax preparation firm, for example—and you choose to offer them,</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/win-new-customers-with-free-consultations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">make sure that you are conducting each consultation in manner that leaves your prospect with a positive impression of your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One way to do this is to focus on getting to know the customer during the consultation rather than just telling them about all the goods and services you have to offer. This way, potential clients will know you truly committed to serving their needs rather than just getting them to swipe their credit card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep customers in the loop</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you changing your hours? Re-evaluating your COVID-19 protocols? Eliminating or adding services? This is certainly your prerogative as a business owner, but you need to make sure your customers (and potential customers) know what’s up so they aren’t caught off guard. Imagine how frustrated they’ll feel when they show up at your door and find the place all locked up (on a day you are normally open for business).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t have to happen, though—customer experience is greatly enhanced by the simple act of keeping people updated on your hours, policies, procedures and offerings. All you have to do is regularly log on to your website to update pertinent information, edit your business listing on Google, post updates on social media, distribute the information via email to customers, etc. Your time investment is minimal, but the payoff is tremendous due to the fact you are eliminating the risk of losing a potential customer over them receiving outdated information about your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to feedback from newer and loyal customers alike</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soliciting feedback is the first step—and you can do this in a variety of ways, like surveys, questionnaires or asking them directly about their experience—but the important part is to really take that feedback to heart. If someone expresses concern about a customer service encounter, for example, make sure that customer knows that you are committed to making it right. If the customer survey you send out reveals a pattern of behavior among staff members that needs to be addressed, address it. If your online reviews leave something to be desired, investigate and make changes as needed. Most importantly, thank your customers for sharing their thoughts with you so they know their voices have been heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive feedback is worth acknowledging, as well. First and foremost, it never hurts to say ‘thanks’ when a customer gives you a five-star review. Also, keep in mind that if customers say they appreciate something they may want more of the same. Whatever it is, continue to provide it to them and their customer experience is bound to be enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offer incentives to loyal customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-established, larger companies often have the resources to set up attractive loyalty programs, and statistics indicate that customers love them—according to the</span><a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/352767/TLR%20Library/Bond%20Loyalty%20Report%202020_US%20ExecSummary.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Bond Brand Loyalty Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 78% of folks surveyed say they are more likely to continue doing business with brands that have loyalty or reward programs (and 72% are more likely to recommend brands with loyalty programs to friends).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business owners can get in on this, too. Even if your resources don’t allow you to put together a multi-tiered program with all the bells and whistles, you can still reward loyal customers in other ways. Simple incentives like gifts, freebies, discounts and special insider deals can go a long way toward enhancing the customer relationship with your loyal patrons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay attention to social media analytics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to use social media to engage with existing and potential customers (and data suggests this is a good idea,</span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/chart/226029/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2019-of-population"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">especially if you are targeting Millennials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gen Zers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), posting regularly and learning the ins-and-outs of the individual platforms is important and beneficial—but don’t stop there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the major social media platforms, from Instagram and Facebook to TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn and Snapchat, provide usage analytics to small business owners. In order to really get to know your customers (and grow business, to boot), consider taking the time to study these analytics—they provide valuable details about the demographics of your social media audience, as well as information about how certain posts are performing, how many people are clicking through to your website and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have this information, you can use it to more effectively reach the folks most likely to interact with you on social media. Rather than just posting updates randomly, for example, you’ll have insight as to the types of posts most likely to appeal to active users, and you’ll know when these active users are logging on to your page. As an added bonus, through the process of elimination you’ll also learn which demographic is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responding to your social media posts so you can find alternative ways to get to know them better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ron J. Williams has built a career out of getting inside customers’ heads. For the past 11 years, this energetic entrepreneur has </span><span style="font-style: italic;">founded, built, invested in, and advised on peer-to-peer, sharing economy, marketplace, social data, and social commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Named by Fast Company as one of its </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3018247/most-creative-people-2012/62-ron-j-williams">100 Most Creative People in Business</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">, Williams is passionate about applying technology to “regular-people problems.” His current venture, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">proofLabs</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, is a strategy, product, and innovation consultancy that helps teams build the perfect products for their customers faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">In his spare time, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Williams</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> advises organizations such as </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://build.org/">BUILD NYC</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://www.stoked.org/">Stoked Mentoring</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> and </span><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="https://codeinteractive.org/">Code Interactive</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> that transform how </span><span style="font-style: italic;">young people</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> of color see themselves and their opportunities in tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Understanding others’ perspectives is vital to the process at proofLabs, and Williams believes it’s essential to the success of any startup. Tim Donovan, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">H</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ead of </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I</span><span style="font-style: italic;">nternal </span><span style="font-style: italic;">C</span><span style="font-style: italic;">ommunications</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> at </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Fundbox, recently talked with Williams to learn how the power of perspectives can help grow your business. Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their conversation. </span></p>

Williams, Managing Partner at proofLabs.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Fundbox: Tell us how you got started in business.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ron J. Williams:</span> My first job [out of college] as an investment banker has served me well even 20 years later. I learned to ask questions: How do you come up with a model for what drives the business? How do you find out where the value is created?</p>
<p>[After working on Wall Street], I started a company that was an early entrant into the sharing economy. Eventually the business failed because I wasn&#8217;t focused on customer needs as acutely as I should have been. That realization was where proofLabs started.</p>
<h3>Jeff Bezos once said, “At Amazon, we’ve always focused on our customers, [not on] our competition.”</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> Bezos is a great [example] of the singular focus on not just the customer, but a specific way in which you add value for a customer. He has laid out very plainly, ‘We’re serving a customer, they are the only group that we care about, and the specific way that we add value to them is we give them the best selection of the least expensive products.’</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, that means everybody on the team, from Jeff Bezos down to the warehouse, knows the metric by which they will ultimately be judged is, ‘Did we create value for the customer?’</p>
<p>A lot of startup [entrepreneurs] think they’re visionaries. If they&#8217;re really good, they get investors excited to buy into their vision. But investors are not [your] customer and getting them excited isn’t the same thing as understanding the real pain point of the customer day-to-day.</p>
<p>We interview customers [to get their perspectives for our clients]. When we get a sense of recurring [pain points], we find somebody who has expressed the pains most acutely. Then we’ll pull their photo and write up their bio. That goes up on everybody&#8217;s desk throughout the office, so the whole team can say, ‘This is who we&#8217;re building for’—not some made-up persona or amalgamation of people.</p>
<p>[You] can have really smart people and really good ideas and still miss the point if you don&#8217;t start with one very real person and solve the problem they&#8217;re having. Whether I&#8217;m helping to redesign a product or create a go-to-market plan, it starts with going back to the customer, crawling into that person&#8217;s head, [standing] in their shoes, living with them and understanding how they think about the world.</p>
<p>I call that skill ‘perspective-taking.’</p>
<h3>Can perspective-taking create a more effective workplace?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> In conflict with teams, I&#8217;ve seen folks going at each other&#8217;s throats. If you just dig in a little bit you realize that what they&#8217;re really arguing about is not, &#8220;My idea is good and your idea is bad.&#8221; It&#8217;s, &#8220;You&#8217;re thinking on a six-month timeline, I’m thinking on an 18-month timeline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being able to take in the other’s perspective can help you reframe your argument or request in ways that reflect [their] understanding and perspective.</p>
<h3>It sounds like perspective taking can also help create more inclusivity in business.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> If products come from problems that we solve, and if problems that are worth solving come from understanding people&#8217;s experiences and their pain, then if we look back at the past 25 years of the internet, we&#8217;ve largely only solved problems for Silicon Valley white males. That&#8217;s a small fraction of the population.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an economic reason why we should be investing in solving the trillions of dollars’ worth of problems that we don&#8217;t even understand because they&#8217;re somebody else&#8217;s unique, very niche problem [that doesn’t fit into that mold]. We have to learn how to network and resource black and brown founders, female founders, LGBTQ founders and then get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p>People pay a ton of lip service [to diversity in business]. But it&#8217;s not enough to hope that we bump into more women or more LGBT folks at a party and then invite them to [work with us]. We have to go actively seek folks out. That is not about quotas. It&#8217;s active participation in progressively changing values.</p>
<h3>What’s your best advice for entrepreneurs putting together their growth plans?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> First, figure out what you really want. In designing your business, what you&#8217;re really doing is designing your life.</p>
<p>A business has a natural upper limit that’s a function of lots of things: How long do you want to run it? How much stress do you want to take on? Is it about [part-time income], or this is supposed to be the “big kahuna?”</p>
<p>There’s a product I&#8217;m tinkering with—a simple product for prepping people for meetings. If that kicked off $50,000 a year, that would be an awesome little pet project.</p>
<p>If I decide I want to put all my eggs in that basket, I would need that thing to be a real business. I’d have to ask, &#8220;Can we grow this into a $20 million business?&#8221;</p>
<p>If I want to raise venture capital, I’d have to ask, “Can we make this a $100 million business?”</p>
<p>The goalposts shift depending on your aspirations, your ambitions, your limitations, your constraints.</p>
<h3>You’re passionate about the power of networking. Why do you think this is so important for entrepreneurs?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">RJW:</span> It&#8217;s not enough to give people advice and tools. It&#8217;s really important that we network. Let’s help communities of entrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, find people to work with, because that&#8217;s where real consumer innovation comes from and where forward momentum is.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is connect good people to build awesome stuff. There&#8217;s nothing better than having an army of people walking around with your best interests in mind because you&#8217;re here to help create value for them too. People doing work even when you&#8217;re not, to help you out—it&#8217;s such a powerful thing.</p>

That’s why we say small business is in our DNA. One such example is our Fundbox Chief of Staff, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/humans-fundbox-emad-elshawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emad ElShawa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who was featured in a recent </span><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/SF-Sams-Burgers-North-Beach-Anthony-Bourdain-16059579.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SFGate article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about his restaurant Sam’s, noted as “One of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s favorite burgers in the world.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15467" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/samsout2-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15467" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/samsout2-1.png" alt="Street view of Sam's Burgers, open since 1966." width="600" height="337" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15467" class="wp-caption-text">Sam&#8217;s restaurant in San Francisco.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a moment to catch up with Emad to share an even deeper story behind his lifetime of helping to run a popular family business and how this also drives his work at Fundbox to help others.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
We’d really like to get your experience as a small business owner, to understand a little bit of the trials and tribulations, challenges and opportunities. To start, please tell us a little bit about your experiences growing up.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The restaurant itself we opened in 1966 and my dad originally was working with his uncle, named Sam, when he opened it. Back then it really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a grind, with my dad trying to raise a family and get a business off the ground at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was literally working 7 days a week 365 days a year. He really never took a day off. But Sam realized pretty quickly that just wasn’t the lifestyle for him, so he decided to go a different direction. My dad took over the restaurant in 1967, keeping the name. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
What gave your dad and uncle the idea to open a restaurant, especially something as specific as a burger place?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad immigrated to the United States when he was 19 years old, originally from Palestine. After he graduated high school, he worked on a farm and then became a butcher. So what he understood more than anything was meat—how to make a good cut of meat, cook it, and serve it properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that really helped him narrow down his options and say, “Okay, this is what I know how to do best and what I think I can make successful.” That’s where the original idea of Sam&#8217;s came from. My dad knew he wanted to run a burger place. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
How did your location in the uniquely nightlife-driven San Francisco neighborhood  of North Beach affect your Dad’s business?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Beach is not normal. It&#8217;s not a normal place for hamburgers nor really any area to run a restaurant. Historically speaking, North Beach was the area where the bars, the jazz clubs, and all the speakeasies and strip clubs were, even back in the 1960s. It&#8217;s kept some form of that throughout the last 50 years. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15468" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15468" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png" alt="A photo looking up Broadway Street in San Francisco, with iconic neon signs in the foreground and an arrow pointing to the location of Sam's restaurant halfway up the block." width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012.png 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SamsBroadway_SF_CA_JohnONeill_25-03-2012-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15468" class="wp-caption-text">Broadway Street, North Beach/Chinatown in 2012. Photo by John O&#8217;Neill.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, Sam’s hours were from 4:00 in the afternoon to 4:00 in the morning—because that&#8217;s when people would go out there to get some drinks, and then they would want some food after that. So Sam’s became a super late-night place, the majority of our business happening between 1:00 and 4:00 in the morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So imagine that. Add to the daily grind not only having to work 12 to 15 hours a day, but those hours are in the middle of the night. So you’re working when everyone else is sleeping and sleeping when everyone else is awake, and then getting up to do it all over again, back-to-back. It’s like having no life.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
I know that over the years you have not been the only burger restaurant in North Beach, but you seem to be one of the few that survived.</h3>
<p><strong>Emad:</strong><b><br />
</b>Sam&#8217;s being in the neighborhood has become something that holds a cultural significance to the City. In the early 2000s, my dad realized that people were coming to Sam&#8217;s just because they wanted a taste of authentic San Francisco. It wasn&#8217;t just a burger place. People started to equate Sam&#8217;s with an authentic San Francisco experience.</p>
<h5><b>[EDITOR’S NOTE:] In honor of its continuous operation—365 days per year since its founding in 1966—Sam’s Burgers is now poised to </b><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/An-authentic-San-Francisco-experience-16197716.php#photo-21030186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>gain Legacy Business status</b></a><b>, already approved by the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission (pending a final vote by the Small Business Commission on June 6, 2021.)</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Other burger places did try to get a piece of the action. A Carl&#8217;s Jr. opened up about a block from where we are. That was one of the biggest scares for my dad, because until then, you had never had these big fast food chains coming into North Beach. We wondered, “What is our actual staying power as a small business?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This difference in dealing with chains and franchises is that you’re not competing with other mom-and-pop burger shops and small restaurants. You&#8217;re now competing with an organization that has deep pockets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, that Carl&#8217;s Jr. only lasted pretty much a year and went out of business. Apparently, people preferred supporting the neighborhood and wanted to continue enjoying that authentic San Francisco experience. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>You need that personal touch with your customers because people aren&#8217;t just coming in for the burgers. They&#8217;re coming in to hear your story. They&#8217;re coming in to hear stories of San Francisco from 30 and 40 years ago.</em></strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong>Fundbox: </strong><br />
&#8220;In all your years running a restaurant, what stands out as something you’ve learned about small businesses success?</h3>
<p><strong>Emad:</strong><br />
A lot of people ask me, “Why did your dad work 50 years seven days a week? Why don&#8217;t you just hire a bunch of people and sit at home and manage the place?”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m a firm believer that small businesses and restaurants in general will have as much success as their owners&#8217; involvement in the place. You can’t be a successful small business owner by being an absentee owner. I&#8217;m not saying that you need to be there every day—but if you are there every day, it does add some sense of additional success by being close enough to manage any step of the process when you need to. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15461" style="width: 303px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-15461" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg" alt="Emad ElShawa" width="303" height="303" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2.jpg 1056w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EmadPhoto2-768x769.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-15461" class="wp-caption-text">Emad ElShawa</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very prideful point for my dad was to say, “We&#8217;ve made every last burger better than the one before it.” When you delegate that mission to employees, it’s hard to really guarantee that level of quality. But when you&#8217;re doing it yourself, it matters so much to you that you&#8217;re serving every last customer with that same attitude.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>What financial challenges have your family faced running a small business for so many decades?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the biggest trials we&#8217;ve had is just the amount of sheer work that it took to keep that up for 55 years in terms of financial troubles. I will say we&#8217;ve been lucky up until this last year, and that while business wasn’t always gangbusters like it had been for the 15 years before COVID, we&#8217;ve always had enough to where we knew we had our bills covered and we can get by.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How did COVID impact your business?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was challenging. We weren&#8217;t immune from everything that came with the pandemic, since the business was closed. That meant we had to essentially fund everything out of pocket at that point. We were still paying our four full-time employees. We paid them all to sit at home—because part of a smart business strategy is when you find good employees, you don&#8217;t want to let go of them. They become a part of the family and a part of the success of the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one of our employees has been with us for eight years. These are people that are embedded in the fabric of our business. Customers come in and ask for them personally. So it&#8217;s very difficult for us to go and say hey we got a pandemic going on. There was no revenue coming in but we had to figure out a way to pay our people enough to support their families (in addition to rent and utilities) with zero money coming in, which we did for the first couple months. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><strong>Part of a smart business strategy is when you find good employees, you don&#8217;t want to let go of them. They become a part of the family and a part of the success of the business.</strong></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a very stressful time, to be quite honest. We were just hemorrhaging money as things started to slowly reopen—but not really reopen, just to be open for business. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How did Sam’s adapt to the new normal?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to completely pivot how we did business throughout our history. Sam&#8217;s is an old-school place. We did not accept credit cards. We were not on any of these delivery apps. We were used to being the place the neighborhood and people around would come in and that was part of the aura in the mystique and the simplicity of Sam&#8217;s for 55 years. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><strong>We realized really quickly that if we&#8217;re going to have any sort of success of making it through this we were going to have to race to come up-to-date. </strong></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We said, “All right, let&#8217;s add as many of these delivery apps as possible. Let&#8217;s figure out how to price things to where we could still pay the delivery apps’ cut and still come out ahead.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also needed to figure out a way where we could add credit cards really quickly. Having a credit card machine is a little bit more difficult than it is anywhere else because it&#8217;s literally an alleyway restaurant. We needed to figure out a way to physically structure the place so people could pay without actually having face-to-face or hand-to-hand touch with any one of our employees. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>How has your recovery been going?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously we&#8217;re not out of the pandemic yet, but the worst of it was about a year. We were open for business, but we were losing money every single month. Nevertheless, we never ever had the conversation of attempting to close. The conversation was how we were going to get to the other side of this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s so embedded in the fabric of our family now, and I think even in the fabric of the community, that closing it down would hurt a lot of us significantly. Long term we knew we wanted to contribute to San Francisco coming back. We wanted to be part of North Beach. It was just like a day-to-day pivot of how we can actually get there.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>You’re not just a part of your family business; you’re also part of the Fundbox family. What was your professional background that led to your work in fintech and with us?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born and raised in San Francisco, and educated in public schools in San Francisco throughout my life—Lincoln High School, then City College, then San Francisco State, then Golden Gate University after that. A large San Francisco bank offered me a work sponsorship program, so I started my first job actually during college as a banker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working for this bank, I saw people from all walks of life coming in. The biggest thing for me was that I could connect directly with small business owners because that’s what I knew. I saw my dad do it every single day. I could naturally talk with a small business owner about the difficulties they were having and relate it to what I saw my own family do to combat those difficulties. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Tell us more about how you focused on small business banking.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating and for about seven years with a major bank, I was the head of small business banking for San Francisco and Marin. During that time I would see a lot of those customers facing the pain points of dealing with traditional banks. For example, taking time out of their day to come and talk to a banker in person, having to bring all these documents, and then having to wait for money that might not come.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fundbox:</strong><br />
How well have small businesses been served by most brick-and-mortar financial institutions?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional banks have a one-size-fits-all system for everybody. They don&#8217;t have a personalized approach to small business banking—and that doesn&#8217;t work in the world of small business. Every single small business, even within sub-industries, is very, very different, just like Sam&#8217;s is different from any other restaurant. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>If you want to offer any type of financial services, it&#8217;s very important that you know your customers and get as much information about them as possible so that you can tailor an approach that will work specifically for them and their business. </em></strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many large, traditional financial institutions lack the technology or the infrastructure to do that. Plus, generally speaking, they are less willing to take on risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics show that in 2019, only about 27% of small business owners actually got approved for a small business loan by big banks. And that&#8217;s after having to submit a very </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/business-financing-options/bank-loans/#:~:text=Bank%20Loan%20Details&amp;text=And%20applying%20also%20takes%20serious,funds%20to%20expand%20your%20business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy paperwork process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often 30 to 40 pages, and going through an underwriting process, which in most cases takes from weeks to months to complete and get an answer. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>With all those forms they review, you’d think banks would have a better understanding of their borrowers. Where is the disconnect?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they&#8217;ve seen a ton of small businesses, typically these lenders haven&#8217;t done a good job of collating the information they received from these businesses, so they don&#8217;t have a holistic view of things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the guy who actually had to collect these documents and often the one underwriting the loans. So this became the issue that was top of mind for me and I started to think about where I could make a better impact for small businesses. That’s when I quit the big bank and joined Fundbox about four years ago.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Tell us about your evolution at Fundbox and how you started helping small businesses get credit.</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of Fundbox’s first underwriters for our highest limits program, my job was to come in and develop an understanding and a strategy of how to give people access to loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously we could not have 40-page applications because we’re not like a big bank. We wanted to fix that pain point, to remove those obstacles from small business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how could we still do this? Theoretically, it’s the same underwriting process, but we do it a ton simpler. For example, our application was only one page long. We also put a ton of emphasis on actually speaking to the customer and getting to know their specific business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our early process was kind of this middle ground between a traditional underwriting approach and where we wanted to go—which was to develop a holistic algorithm that puts more emphasis on data points that traditional banks don&#8217;t even look at. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hands-on, small business underwriting experience helped Fundbox to develop and make our algorithms smarter, because over time, as you&#8217;re looking at hundreds of small businesses, you start to see that certain individual data points matter more than others. That’s just one reason why our algorithm helps make credit decisions possible in minutes, instead of weeks.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>In what you’ve learned as a small business owner and working at Fundbox, what are three quick tips you can offer other businesses?</h3>
<p><b>Emad:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b>The number one tip is to solve one problem at a time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plugging all the holes at the same time is tempting but it’s not possible. Whatever the biggest problem is at that moment, solve that one and then move on to the next. </span></p>
<p><b>The second tip is to be a nice person.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s probably an under-appreciated one, but that&#8217;s going to affect your day-to-day life in everything you do as a small business owner. Be nice in how you deal with vendors, how you deal with customers, how you deal with employees, and even lenders. Niceness has a mushroom effect. Your customers and employees will be more loyal. Even your vendors’ deliveries may be prioritized over people that are not as nice as you. </span></p>
<p><b>Third, find a way to personally engage with your customers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sam&#8217;s personal touch advantage has been a challenge to adapt to this new reality of social distancing, so social media has become a great way to pick up the slack. We try to engage with the people who follow us so that they can at least continue to be reminded of who we are and what we mean to the City. People want to have those conversations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are ready to fully open up again, it&#8217;s going to go right back to that because people want to come and they want to get to know you and talk and share their own stories. That&#8217;s going to come back. </span></p>
<h3><b>Fundbox:</b><b><br />
</b>Thank you Emad, and congratulations on your recognition as a legacy business in San Francisco. We’re hoping the next 50 years ahead for Sam’s Burgers will be as warm and successful as your first 50 years.</h3>

A solid CRM database can help you simplify your business flow and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build stronger relationships with the customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and clients you need to help boost your sales easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CRM system houses all of your data, customer information, and reports in one convenient location, which enables your sales and marketing teams to better analyze their relationships with your current and potential clients and customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s examine what you need to look for when choosing a CRM and at some of the best CRMs for small business on the market. Spoiler alert—some of them are free to use.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to Look for in a CRM</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing a CRM system, you’ll want to find one that suits all of your business needs and makes your employee’s jobs easier so they can focus on doing what they do best, instead of trying to organize overwhelming amounts of customer data. When shopping around for a CRM, you’ll want to read a lot of reviews, chat with their sale’s teams, and watch tutorials on how to use their platforms. When you’re doing your research, these are the qualities and features you should pay attention to.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrates with other platforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to use</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong analytic capabilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can access via mobile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation options</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer service support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training requirements and resources</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How workflow is managed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workflow management</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you’ll choose a CRM that you can customize to fit your needs, that is easy to use, and that works for your budget. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Best CRMs for Small Businesses </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of different CRM systems on the market and which one is right for your business will depend on your businesses’ unique needs. Let’s look at some of the best CRMs for small businesses and what makes them stand out.</span></p>
<h3>1. Salesforce</h3>
<p><a href="https://essentials.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the biggest names in the CRM game and is one of the most popular CRM providers on the market. They offer a cloud-based product that is completely customizable and is fairly easy to use on both desktop and mobile. Salesforce is one of the pricier options on this list, starting at $25 per month for up to five users and the price goes up if you want a more sophisticated plan, but many say the high prices are worth it. </span></p>
<h3>2. Zoho CRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cloud-based solution is </span><a href="http://www.zoho.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoho CRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses on providing resources for small and medium-sized businesses. If you’re looking for sales and CRM marketing automation, customer analytics, and product configuration, you’ll find what you need here. Zoho CRM also makes it easy to incentivize your sales team by having a gamification feature designed to reward employees who hit their monthly sales targets. For those with a tighter budget, Zoho CRM offers a free CRM solution, as well as paid plans starting at $14 a month that offer extra features. </span></p>
<h3>3. Hubspot CRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubspot is known for providing great marketing resources as well as valuable tools that make running and marketing a business easier. Their full functioning CRM product (</span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubspot CRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) can help track and organize your contacts, providing a full view of your sales pipeline. They also offer a free version of their CRM, which comes with more functionality and assistance like phone support. Their CRM service is easy to navigate which is great for CRM beginners. </span></p>
<h3>4. Apptivo</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This web-based CRM makes it simple to track and stay on top of projects, customer relationships, and finances. </span><a href="https://www.apptivo.com/solutions/crm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apptivo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is super customizable and you get to pick the features that will suit your business. Their product is very compatible with Google applications, so if you rely on those to run your business, you’ll likely appreciate the convenience of linking up with Apptivo. Plans start at $8 a month.</span></p>
<h3>5. Vtiger CRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses who want to streamline their operations will appreciate that </span><a href="https://www.vtiger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vtiger CRM </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides sales automation, project and inventory management, workflow automation, and case and lead management features, amongst many other helpful features. While this CRM tool can be harder to customize, they’re known for having a great tech support team who is always willing to help. </span></p>
<h3>6. Nimble</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re aiming to unify your data and improve your social media integration, </span><a href="https://www.nimble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nimble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help with that. Their software populates the profiles and interaction histories from your contact lists, email, and social media automatically. Users appreciate their comprehensive interface which gives a great overview of what’s going on in your business. You’ll be able to easily overlook your key deals, engagement opportunities, and important to-do’s. </span></p>
<h3>7. SuiteCRM</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business is growing, you’ll want to pick a CRM that can grow with you. </span><a href="https://suitecrm.com/what-is-suitecrm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuiteCRM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is likely up to the task as it is an open source CRM that can be scaled to work well for any size of business. They have enterprise-level functionality and you can choose to deploy their software on either a private cloud, directly on private servers, or on a public cloud. Their tool is very customizable and can suit a variety of budgets as they have a free CRM option. This isn’t the easiest CRM to use and it may take some practice to get the hang of it. Typically, SuiteCRM is a better fit for companies with more advanced CRM needs. </span></p>
<h3>8. Insightly</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insightly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a free CRM service that makes it easy to track your business leads and to ensure that you’re following up with leads on time. You can also manage tasks for your team with Insightly and can link your customer’s social media accounts to your CRM so you can manage the conversion process easier. While Insightly doesn’t offer live customer support they do provide you with access to a beginner’s guide to using their CRM, video tutorials, webinars, and a community forum where users can answer each other’s questions and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/collaborate-community-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">support each other.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Insightly is a great option for startups on a budget who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get to work. </span></p>
<h3>9. Act!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.act.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a ton of neat integrations that will help you get the most out of this CRM tool. You can manage your contacts and leads while taking advantage of reporting and third-party integrations. Other integrations can assist with managing your accounting processes, creating pipeline reports, and overseeing client history. They offer a cloud-based version or a server-based version, so you can choose which format works best for you. This is ideal if you’re </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving your business online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have a preferred format. If you’re a fan of email marketing, you’ll appreciate that Act! offers built-in email marketing tools that you can integrate with your phone systems. Some users reported that their software is easy to use, but if you’re looking for a lot of integration options you may find the adjustment is worth it. Pricing starts at $15 a month and goes up to $45 a month depending on which plan you choose. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does Google have a CRM product?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a commonly asked question during CRM research and unfortunately the answer is no. However, Google does allow you to sync up your Google Workspace with plenty of helpful CRM and sales tools that you can discover through the </span><a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/category/business-tools/sales-and-crm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer Microsoft tools to Google ones anyways, you’re in luck, because Microsoft Dynamics CRM will look and feel very familiar to Microsoft Office users and it syncs up well with other Microsoft products. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1785159365-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="A face mask wearing shop owner opens her dorr and welcomes a mask-wearing customer into her business." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1785159365-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_1785159365.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If boosting customer loyalty is among your business goals in 2021, mark your calendar now for Get to Know Your Customers Day—a quarterly event observed on the third Thursdays of January, April, July and October. This year’s next Get to Know Your Customers Day is July 15. Consider it an opportunity to improve your customer relationships by adding names to faces, and finding out precisely what your customers love about your business and what added services and/or features might make them love it even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting to know your customers goes beyond just learning their demographics or even their names. It can be more actionable for your business to learn what their pain points are, what problems they are trying to solve, what they expect, and even what their complaints are (both about your business and especially your competitors).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How (and why) did <em>Get to Know Your Customers Day</em> start?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific origins of the customer-centric holiday are unknown, but some sources trace it back to the early days of the e-commerce boom when brick-and-mortar establishments needed to find ways to avoid losing business to online retailers. And while the retail- and service-industry landscapes have evolved since then (particularly in the past year), the principles that guided the creation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customers Day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still apply. Namely, the importance of two-way communication between customers and businesses—according to Microsoft’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 State of Global Customer Service Report</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-CNTNT-Report-DynService-2017-global-state-customer-service-en-au.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of respondents nationwide look favorably upon businesses that solicit and respond to customer feedback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The tangible outcome? Increased loyalty to your brand, thanks to prioritization of the customer relationship.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observing <em>Get to Know Your<br />
Customers Day</em> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how, specifically, do you get to know your customers better (on January 21 and beyond)? Here’s a know-your-customer checklist, with five actions to help establish and nurture positive customer relationships.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Ask customers to complete a digital survey/questionnaire.</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get to</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customer Day</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great opportunity to ask for that aforementioned feedback. Then, use the information you acquire to better meet their needs. If you already have a database of customer email addresses, you’re one step ahead. You can also post a link to your social media pages or tell them about the survey when they visit your establishment in person. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good probing questions include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you hear about us? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">What product or service among our offerings is most important to you?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How often do you shop for our products and/or services?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">How satisfied are you with our policies and procedures?</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take this a step further, consider conducting what Franz calls a journey mapping event, in which you gather information from customers about the “journey” that ultimately led to a purchase (she likes to do this in person if possible, but journey mapping can also occur digitally or remotely).  </span></p>
<p><b>2. Talk to them.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even if you can’t interact with customers face-to-face, conversations are still possible. Customers appreciate responses to social media posts and email messages. And if your business is currently open to the public, take some extra time on January 21 for genuine get-to-know-you conversations (Franz calls this ‘collecting breadcrumbs of data’). Once you know things like where they live, what they do for a living, how many children or pets they have and what they like to do for fun, you can create customer profiles—and these profiles will allow you to provide a more personalized experience to each individual (for example, you’ll know to call them when you receive a shipment of a product they love). If your doors are closed, no worries—social media is a great tool for info gathering too (many customers enjoy responding to inquisitive posts from business owners). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with customers through conversation is also an effective way to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manage problems like late-paying customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A customer you know well is probably more likely to answer your inquiries about payment-related issues.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b>3. Host a giveaway.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oftentimes the mere opportunity to receive a gift is enough to draw someone in. Let them know how much you appreciate their loyalty by giving away a coveted product or service, or by offering a swag bag to the first 50 people to enter your establishment, or to anyone who returns the above mentioned survey. If your doors are closed due to Covid-19 restrictions, consider conducting giveaways on social media instead.</span></span></p>
<p><b>4. Hold a customer appreciation event. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invite customers to stop by during designated hours for refreshments, special discounts, prizes and casual conversation (essentially, a party in their honor).You can even set up the event outside if indoor events are prohibited.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b>5. Thank them.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And if live events, giveaways or surveys aren’t doable at the moment? Nothing beats a genuine ‘thank you’ when it comes to opening the lines of communication with a customer. Consider sending a card or email, or even picking up the phone to say “we appreciate your business” and to let them know you welcome feedback and conversation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting your plans to work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of knowing your customers and showing you care about them can require some modest investments, to cover events, promotions, of giveaways. If you don’t have the immediate budget for such initiatives, a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can give you fast access to the short-term cash you need to make these happen.</span></p>

The unofficial holiday reminds us to celebrate our blessings by going out of our way to do good deeds unexpectedly to both strangers and the people we already know. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you might’ve never given too much thought about how your company could benefit from Random Acts of Kindness Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it turns out that a few small acts of kindness—on the holiday or really on any other day, for that matter—can have a profoundly positive impact on your team, your customers, and your community.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a small act of kindness?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the name suggests, a small act of kindness is a minor gesture you do to put a smile on someone’s face or make them feel happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not talking about giving a random person $100,000 or anything like that. Think more along the lines of helping an older person cross the street, holding the coffee shop door open for the person who’s pushing a stroller behind you, or complimenting your waiter for going above and beyond and being exceptional at their job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many small acts of kindness you can do that don’t cost a penny, you might also want to leave that great waiter a large tip or pay to fill up a random person’s gas tank.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do small acts of kindness impact others?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of simply being a nice thing to do, exuding kindness can have a profoundly positive impact on our personal and professional lives.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It improves our health</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/how-sharing-kindness-can-make-you-healthier-happier/art-20390060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayo Clinic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, being kind to other people makes us happier and reduces our own pain and tension. It might even slow down the aging process, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When our minds are cluttered with negative emotions, it’s harder for us to think clearly and make the best decisions. Being kind helps us function at a </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dont-forget-the-basil/201806/being-kind-others-benefits-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher psychological level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which enables us to figure out the best way forward in any situation instead of making rash decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, studies have shown that being kind can be more impactful on the giver than the recipient. So, next time you feel like going out of your way to do something nice, don’t hesitate to do it even for selfish reasons.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes other people feel generous</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kindness is contagious. In fact, </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/11/making-kindness-a-core-tenet-of-your-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that when folks perceive others as being kind to them, they are more likely to return the favor and be kind to other people, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, not only will you feel healthier by being kind to other people—you will improve </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">well-being, too. Instead of being an irate boss adding to their stress, your kindness has the opposite effect, and that effect can ripple across your entire small business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, all of your employees become kinder overnight, which improves your company culture and impresses every customer that interacts with your team.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes you more persuasive as a leader</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you’re tasked with getting your team to see your vision and trust you enough to follow you on the journey.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/connect-then-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kindness helps here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, too. When you are warm and friendly with your team, you’re more likely to build rapport and camaraderie—making it that much easier for you to convince your team to follow your lead.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are some random acts of kindness I can do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to be kind this National Random Acts of Kindness Day, here are three ideas to get you thinking in the right direction.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Write your employees handwritten thank-you notes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees are the lifeblood of your small business. How often do you sing their praises for hitting it out of the park day in and day out? In the digital age, a handwritten note is something that makes us stop and think. Spending some time writing brief letters to everyone on your team to convey what they mean to you and your business can go a long way toward bringing some brightness to their lives—brightness that can persist for months and even years.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Be more flexible with collecting client payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every company has deep pockets. So, why not help the less fortunate? For example, you might decide to secure a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/fundbox-podcast-chocolatier-pivots-during-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would enable you to give your cash-strapped clients a few extra weeks to pay their bills. This is exactly what Strider, an online marketing and SEO agency, did to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helping-underserved-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help underserved clients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest in marketing without losing sleep over an invoice they needed to pay.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Volunteer to help your local community</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great way to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day is by enlisting your team to volunteer their time to help support a local cause. For example, you might decide to clean up a park, cook meals for the less fortunate, or have a bake sale and donate the proceeds to a local nonprofit. As an added bonus, such activities double as team-building exercises, which can help you cultivate a stronger team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, there are an infinite number of ways to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day. No matter what you decide to do, just remember that there’s no rule preventing you from being kind day in and day out.</span></p>

<h3><b>First of all, tell us a bit about what you do for Fundbox.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Marlena Stallworth: </strong>I was hired in May, 2019 as an Onboarding Specialist, helping customers to potentially acquire a Fundbox line of credit for their business. These are people who&#8217;ve input their information to the application process but haven&#8217;t completed it. Generally that&#8217;s going to be for one or two reasons: either they&#8217;re uncertain about the product or they want somebody to walk them through the technical questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are some typical questions people have when applying for a line of credit?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes our prospective customers ask themselves, &#8220;Do I even need this?&#8221; They may be concerned about what terms we have to offer and how they would work into their business&#8217;s other ongoing payment cycles. Is this really a good fit? Getting clarity on eligibility requirements is pretty common. Will applying affect their credit score? (It won&#8217;t.) Or, if they&#8217;re looking at how to calculate the interest rate on their own, that part might be a little confusing; that&#8217;s because our loans are for only 12 or 24 weeks, not for 12 months, so APR (annual percentage rate) really doesn&#8217;t represent an accurate reflection of what we offer. </span></p>
<h3><b>What did you learn in your first few months that made you so successful? You&#8217;re now the onboarding team lead.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, sometimes we&#8217;d make maybe 80 to 100 calls, and to me, when you spread that level of activity across a day, I would beg to question what was the quality of the actual conversation. How well were we really taking the time to help each customer? So the next couple months I really thought about how to develop better strategies—not just in terms of the calls, but for all touch points, like emails and the application itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like some of the questions we were asking were a little too generalized. And so I worked really hard at getting those conversations to be a bit more personable because I was trying really hard to get people to trust us more as agents for them, not just as reps for Fundbox. Credit is a very personal thing. It can be a very emotional process—because it&#8217;s your small business and your money, and sometimes even your employees&#8217; livelihoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by taking more time on these phone calls. If the average customer phone call was just a few minutes, mine was maybe 12 to 15. Sometimes I would learn about people&#8217;s family members, how many cats they have, how long they&#8217;ve been in business, and what their plans are for the future of the business. It would start to make sense why having a kind of safety net in your back pocket would be good for all the things that matter to you at the core of your heart and your business.</span></p>
<h3><b>How did your background and career path before Fundbox prepare you for what you&#8217;re doing today? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In college I minored in dance, which was my passion since I was three, and I majored in English Education—because I love to communicate with people and tend to get acquainted with people easily. This seemed like the natural course, since I have a lot of educators in my family. But I quickly learned the business aspect of education didn&#8217;t mesh well with me from an emotional standpoint, with all the bureaucracy and different political views within the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead, I got into retail as a manager for a long time. It was there that I realized I just really loved people! From a professional standpoint, that kind of led the way for me. Selling things or services to people, whether it&#8217;s a wardrobe or a life insurance plan, is all about figuring out how this is going to benefit them. I&#8217;d think, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get to know you so well, you&#8217;re going to trust me with your life.&#8221; And I never shied away from that concept ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent years in banking, starting back about maybe 12 or 13 years ago. That exposure to investment bankers is what really got me really interested in life insurance. I&#8217;ve maintained my license to solicit life insurance and annuities. I think having those tough, detailed conversations with families about what their needs are, whether business or domestic customers, is where I learned to develop more thorough customer correspondence. People want to work through the process. That human aspect is greatly appreciated by customers. I realized working for smaller banks, this acute attention is rarely seen in larger lending institutions. Smaller firms train their people to get to know you better, and that same level of attention can be seen at Fundbox. </span></p>
<h3><b>What keeps you motivated, working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my manager(s) could tell you, the money is the smallest factor of motivation for me.  I generally use financial metrics to help motivate others. I firmly believe that when you are consistently doing what’s right by the customer, the numbers all fall in place. The process of understanding our customers is motivating in itself.  Employing great listening skills in order to remain keenly aware of why customers choose to work with Fundbox is imperative. Did they find us or were they referred to us? What helped them make that decision? What can we help resolve? How can we help you grow?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions aren’t merely asked for the purpose of completing a checklist. It&#8217;s really about building our relationship with that person and I have always been committed to having the conversation—whether it&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s a great fit, just a good fit, or not a good fit for us right now. At the end of the conversation, I always hoped prospective customers would feel like they were more educated no matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy meeting customers where they are and aligning recommendations based on what they’re trying to achieve. It’s important to build up a natural sensitivity to people where they are in circumstances. Having to flex that muscle has become really important during the pandemic because people are not only just facing the concept of how the pandemic is affecting their business; now it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s affecting their family. Some people just really need to hear that they’re not alone, we&#8217;re here for them and remain very grateful for their continued business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Helping applicants become new customers isn&#8217;t all you do for Fundbox. You&#8217;re also improving awareness, allyship, and corporate culture here by leading an employee resource group. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several instances of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">injustice against Black people have recently come to the forefront on various social platforms. We know for certain that current racial conditions are not going to improve by one community acting on its own. We know now more than ever that we all need each other to truly see continuous progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the death of George Floyd, the executive and human resources teams approached me and Jordan Eldridge, our Sales Enablement Manager, regarding having an open discussion with the company. It was definitely important to get a real pulse check of our staff’s feelings around racial disparity and inequality. We followed through by leading four segments of discussions in a Round-table forum. This was particularly imperative since we have many employees of different demographics in very different regions of the world, between California, Texas, and Israel. These discussions gave us an opportunity to really gain a respect for the outlook and perspectives of each individual. We need to work as a people, as Americans, not just black, not just white, not just Latin, whomever—we all need to work together to make a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First we started the #Allyship channel on Slack [our internal online message board], which allowed us as employees to have an outlet to exchange information across the board, sharing different perspectives so that everybody could see our experiences and continue to learn from one another. Then we developed the Employee Resource Group, forming three different teams: The Pride group,  the Women at Fundbox, and The Melanin Collective. </span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about The Melanin Collective group, which you lead at Fundbox.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name,  Melanin Collective, is very important because sharing perspectives across cultural demographics is a pivotal aspect. Black culture is embraced and celebrated by people of all communities. We want to impress upon our members that we are all a “Collective of Melanin”; all humans are of color. Moving forward and progressing from a systemic aspect, we all have to continue to do this together. As a group, The Melanin Collective is working to bring many benefits to Fundbox. We strive to identify and help develop internal leaders within Fundbox in an effort to bridge the gap to see more Black leaders represented in our company. Our efforts will lead to higher retention rates as we continue to educate staff  through internal events, panels and more. In the upcoming season, our staff will be growing tremendously. We are working to recruit underrepresented individuals and develop a diverse pipeline of remarkable talent. </span></p>
<h3><b>What advice do you have for anyone else who&#8217;s considering working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an open mind and be flexible because even after 8 years, there is still a lot of the startup feel. Change is sometimes the highest constant, especially this year. You should be comfortable with maybe wearing more than one hat at the same time on any given day. I think that that will lead people to a lot of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, be yourself. I particularly love Fundbox because I get to bring myself. I not only get to be my true self, my unique personality is genuinely appreciated here. I think that&#8217;s the one thing that really stands out if I compare my career experiences. I feel that what is so appreciated about my skill set has a lot to do with my soft skills and integrity, not merely the book-sense and credentials that I brought to the job. </span></p>
