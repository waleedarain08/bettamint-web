<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in quality equipment or other business upgrades can be critical to boosting productivity and operational efficiency, and ultimately to the ongoing success and growth of a business. However, while these upgrades are beneficial for small businesses, the associated costs are often prohibitive, requiring substantial upfront investment. Term loans can help by providing the funds necessary to make an outright purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When growing your business is a priority, having the right equipment is key. So how can small businesses access the funding needed for equipment upgrades, renovations, or expansion? If the cost of upgrading your business presents a challenge to your cash flow, depending on the specific needs of your business an equipment or term loan may be the answer.</span></p>
<h2>What is equipment financing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly </span><a href="https://www.elfaonline.org/about/industry-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight in ten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. companies (79 percent) use some form of financing when acquiring equipment, including loans, leases, and lines of credit (but excluding credit cards). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, equipment financing is funding that enables businesses to purchase the equipment required for business operations and growth. By providing the funds needed to purchase equipment, this type of lending can help free up working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you have multiple viable options you can explore to obtain financing for equipment and for other growth initiatives. Determining the right one depends on the needs of your business and many other factors. Consider the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximate loan amount needed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business revenue</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repayment terms </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit scores (personal and business)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projected return on investment (ROI) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&#8217;s take a look at some of the financing avenues available: </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans are a great option for small business owners in need of quick access to cash to upgrade their businesses. Here’s why: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans provide you with a lump sum upfront, which you’ll repay, along with interest and fees, over a fixed period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can range from short-term loans with repayment periods of one year or less, to longer-term loans with repayment periods up to 10 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll enjoy greater flexibility in the ways you can use the funds from a term loan in comparison to equipment-only loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans enable businesses short on cash flow to invest in equipment, but also the opportunity to maximize revenue growth. For example, you could use the funds from a term loan to extend operations, buy equipment, or finance new marketing or advertising initiatives. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional advantage of using a term loan to fund large equipment investments is that equipment owned by the business can be claimed on the business’s tax return as a depreciating asset. Depreciation measures the value of an asset over time as it ages from wear and tear. Business equipment qualifies for the write-off if it is used to generate income, and if its lifespan is expected to be more than one year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name implies, equipment loans exist for a single purpose: to finance your equipment. The equipment itself acts as collateral and when you&#8217;re done making payments, you will own the equipment. Until then, if you default on the loan, the lender can take back the equipment to help recoup their costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment is typically quite expensive and outright investment can quickly drain a business’s bank account. By providing the funds needed to purchase equipment, this type of lending can help improve a business’s working capital for other expenses.  Equipment lenders are usually more flexible when it comes to credit scores and financial history so it may be quicker and easier to qualify for an equipment loan — especially since the equipment you are purchasing is often used as collateral to secure the loan. On the other hand, more traditional lenders like a bank or credit union typically require higher credit scores, extensive financial history, and other documentation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as with any other form of financing, there are also a few potential drawbacks to equipment loans. These include restrictive usage terms, high down payment requirements, maintenance liability, and depreciation risk. Unlike other types of loans, which offer more flexibility in how you can make use of the borrowed funds, equipment loans are limited to equipment purchases.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment leasing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to leasing versus buying a car, rather than buying your equipment, you also have the option to lease it for a set period of time. In this scenario, the lender owns the equipment, and you are simply paying to use it. Unlike equipment financing, equipment leases generally do not require down payments or collateral and may have lower monthly installments than an equipment loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leasing is also a good option for you if you plan to buy the equipment but need more flexible payment terms, or if you think you will need to replace the equipment at the end of the lease. However, depending on the purchase payment terms at the end, leasing could end up costing you more in the long run. Additionally, when you own a piece of equipment, you can take advantage of </span><a href="https://www.section179.org/section_179_deduction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 179 depreciation tax benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it will be yours to sell if you decide you no longer need or want it in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different avenues to obtaining equipment financing for business upgrades, expansion, and equipment purchases. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the best one depends on the unique needs of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just as you would when making any large purchase, you can make sure you’re getting the best possible financing deal for your business by thoroughly comparing terms between lenders before making any commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a small business owner in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Whether you’re trying to expand or looking to buy equipment and inventory, a business term loan may be the solution you need. The loan can be used to invest in the growth of your business, and then the returns can help you to repay the loan and interest over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure where to start? The good news is you don’t have to step into a bank or even leave your desk chair to shop for term loans for your business. Online lenders can make it easy and convenient to apply from your smartphone or computer, and Fundbox may be able to help. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and find out in minutes if you are approved and get funding as soon as the next business day.</span></p>

While this is undoubtedly positive for those businesses, the busiest time of the year can present unique cash flow challenges for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a construction company, for example, you might have funds tied up in supplies and building materials. That can make it harder to pay for other vital expenses — like payroll, utilities, gasoline, insurance, and more. You might also have to pay contractors and subcontractors before your customers settle their bills. Then, there’s always the risk that a job runs over budget, leaving you with a skinnier profit margin than you planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landscaping companies run into similar problems. With more lawns to mow and more gardens to maintain, you might decide to buy or lease more equipment — tying up cash along the way. Customers might not always pay their invoices on time either, creating additional financial challenges.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade credit: The $3.1 trillion question</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One primary reason that construction and landscaping companies — along with businesses in virtually all other industries — run into cash flow problems is that they deal in</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/trade-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trade credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Trade credit, also called “net terms,” refers to the conventional method of financing transactions between sellers and buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how trade credit works: A seller might pay upfront for inventory, services, or supplies to a buyer, giving them 30, 60, 90, or even 120 days to pay their bills. A landscaping subcontractor, for example, might invoice their clients at the end of the month and then give them 30 days to pay from there. On the flip side, a construction company might use trade credit to get building materials, tools, roofing supplies, and more from a supplier and have 60 days before payment is due.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, sellers—who would undoubtedly prefer to be paid immediately on every sale—accept trade credit because it’s the standard. Without offering it, it’s nearly impossible for those sellers to compete. Buyers, however, typically like the arrangement because they’re able to purchase more than they otherwise could, which helps them grow their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that according to research from</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PYMNTS and Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, trade credit has severe, often damaging financial implications for U.S. businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PYMNTS survey found that on any given day U.S. companies are collectively owed $3.1 trillion in unpaid invoices, making it that much harder for them to run their businesses. When merchants extend trade credit, they themselves cannot plan to get paid on time, as some customers will pay even later than the agreed-to terms. </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/report-the-reason-48-pct-of-high-margin-smbs-pay-suppliers-late/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these customers expect to be able to pay late</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they consider themselves to be such good customers. For years, this has been the norm, especially in B2B transactions and certain trades like construction or landscaping.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge with traditional trade credit arrangements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade credit essentially makes the companies that extend it assume the role of a bank for their clients—but without the upside (like the interest that accrues immediately). Even if every single client pays on time, there are still massive administrative implications to consider. For example, reviewing applications for trade credit, approving those applications, setting up new customers with accounts or terms, making sure invoices are sent on time, keeping track of who owes what, and staying on top of when payments are due are all time-consuming back-office tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say in the age of automation, the current system of trade credit leaves a lot to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, while receivables might look beautiful on the balance sheet, you can’t exactly use those funds to grow a business. Managing day-to-day operations while waiting for funds to arrive can be needlessly stressful and challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for pursuing new opportunities or investing in new initiatives? That’s often out of the question, too, without a comfortable sum in the bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that no matter which side of the transaction you’re on, your construction or landscaping business can take advantage of innovative new solutions offered by fintech companies. Technology is rapidly expanding opportunities for businesses to get easier access to the funds they need to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fundbox can help you access the working capital your business needs through a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Your first client, your first dollar, your first day at work are all pivotal moments for your career. Though you may be operating from a single desk in a one-room office, you still imagine the future when your business is booming, employees are bustling, and you have more work than you can handle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many businesses never reach that point. In fact, only about </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive their first year of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve built a strong foundation and emerged from your first few years with a thriving business—congratulations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you’re looking to expand your business and you’re wondering what’s next. First, a word of caution: Expanding your business too soon or too aggressively can be devastating, especially to a construction company. The good news is you can avoid many common pitfalls with some careful planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll walk you through deciding when to expand your construction business, and how to prepare for expansion when you’re ready.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Signs You’re Ready to Expand Your Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you go too far with the process, it’s important to make sure you’re actually ready to expand your construction business. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is expanding before you’re ready. If you scale too soon, you will tap out your resources, potentially leaving yourself cash-strapped and stretched too thin. Here are the most important things to consider before you make the jump:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. You Have Plenty of Work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When businesses consider expansion, it’s usually for one of two reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have more work than their resources can handle, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t have enough work and hope that expanding into new markets will fix this problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, only the first type of businesses survive an expansion. While a new service or territory may be the answer for a small percentage of companies who are lacking sales, it’s rarely the best solution to the problem. In this case, it’s better to reconsider your marketing efforts, customer service, and other potential problems before considering expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your phones are constantly ringing and contracts are coming in quicker than you can count, however, you’re likely ready to grow.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Your Clients Are Happy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, you also want happy customers. If you have plenty of repeat customers or word-of-mouth is your primary marketing strategy, then proceed to the next point. If not, you might evaluate the situation and make sure your current customers are completely satisfied before considering expansion.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. You Have More Money Than Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are checks coming in promptly? Are you meeting payroll without any issues? Are you able to pay yourself a salary? Then you probably don’t have a lot of time on your hands, and that’s okay. In fact, that’s a sure sign that it’s time to consider expanding your business. If nothing else, you need another set of hands to handle some of the tasks, giving yourself room to breathe.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Opportunities for Expansion Arise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe your customers are requesting services that you don’t offer yet. Maybe clients are requesting bids or estimates for jobs outside your current territory. Maybe someone is selling their business, and you’re thinking it would be a great complement to your current services. These are all viable opportunities for expansion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-15850 size-full" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png" alt="" width="1240" height="768" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png 1240w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7-768x476.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step-by-Step Expansion Budgeting Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve decided expansion is the answer, it’s time to start the process. But first, it’s time to make a budget.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Your Plan for Expanding Your Business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of expansions, and it’s important to consider all the different facets of your own plan. Depending on how you plan to expand, you’ll need to focus on different expenses and other considerations. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to acquire another company? If so, you will need to consider real estate closing costs, office and warehouse expenses (including rent and utilities), and additional employee salaries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to add a few more services to your existing business? If that’s the case, your budget may be simpler. You will need to consider things like the materials and labor required to offer those services, as well as any possible overhead expense increases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to bid more jobs? This plan might require more employees. Consider all of the costs associated with those employees, and what they will need to take on more work. You may need to purchase more equipment, more materials, and more tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re thinking, it’s time to get it all down on paper. Start with the overall goal of your expansion, then start listing the steps you will need to take to achieve that goal. Don’t forget small things like acquiring permits and business licenses for new territories, too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimate Your Budget</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimating your budget seems like a huge task, but it’s quite simple when you break it down into smaller steps. You already have the overall plan for your expansion, so now it’s time to dig into the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help getting started, take a blank business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fill in the data using your current financial information. When you’re finished, you should have a strong starting point for a budget that reflects your current financial situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, using your expansion outline created above, fill in another budget template with your projected costs after the expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to do some research to estimate these numbers. For example, if you will need a new office for your expansion, search for available properties in the area to find a good estimate for rent. You may want to work with your bookkeeper or accountant on this planning exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, your goal here is to make sure you remember every possible new expense post-expansion. Common expenses include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee salaries and benefits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land and/or real estate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisition costs if you’re buying another company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials, tools, and equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and advertising</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation and lodging if you’re expanding your service area</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have estimated expenses outlined, you should also </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/formula-for-sales-forecast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimate your future sales.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself a “best case scenario” estimate and a “worst case scenario” estimate. You may want to fill out several different budget sheets to explore different possible outcomes. You can use these numbers to see when your expansion plan will start turning a profit and how much of a profit you can expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, using the range of numbers determined from your budget estimates, you can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research business financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, apply for the financing you need, and finalize the next steps of your expansion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business is seldom easy, but growth is almost inevitable for any strong business model. If you walk through these steps one by one and aren’t afraid of research, you can start your expansion with a strong budget and the funds you need to get the job done quickly. Then you can get back to what you do best: running your business.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Could an equipment loan help improve you improve your restaurant or small business?" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_785814271.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Technology moves pretty fast these days, and as a small business owner, you need to make sure your equipment can keep up with demand. Traditionally, most business owners use an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/equipment-loans/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=EquipmentLoan&amp;keywords=1">equipment loan</a></span> to finance new or upgraded equipment like heavy machinery, trucks for a delivery business, or ovens for a restaurant. However, you can get innovative with how you use <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/business-loans/equipment-financing/">equipment financing</a></span> for your small business.</p>
<h2>First, what is an equipment loan?</h2>
<p>Business equipment loans help business owners acquire equipment that would normally be too expensive to buy with cash. The equipment you’re financing can also <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.lendio.com/blog/small-business-insights/collateral-secure-business-loan/">act as your collateral</a></span>, which means you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-business-loans/">secure a loan without spending money</a></span> upfront. Most lenders will require you to be in business at least 12 months with $50,000 or more in annual revenue, and a credit score of 650 or higher.</p>
<p>Since every type of business has specific needs, there are small business equipment financing options for nearly every industry. Equipment loans are relatively easy to obtain (when compared with traditional term loans), and they help preserve cash flow for your small business. There are restrictions, though: with most types of equipment loan, you can <em>only</em> use the capital to buy the specified equipment, which means you should have a plan for exactly what type of equipment you need and what the return on investment will be.</p>
<h2>Get creative with equipment in your small business</h2>
<p>With the right equipment, you can not only increase efficiency in your business, but also customer and employee loyalty. Beyond using equipment financing to buy the tools you need to operate or for major operational upgrades, consider using equipment loans for smaller pieces of technology that will have a big impact on your customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchase tablets to empower your customers</span>.</h3>
<p>With the right software, you can turn tablets into assets that will further engage your customers and allow you to provide better service to them. If you’re a restaurant or cafe with made-to-order items, you can give customers a chance to review their options before they approach the register. If you’re a beauty salon owner, you can skip the mass-produced catalogues and use tablets to provide examples of your own work, or styles hand-picked by your staff, to provide a more customized experience for customers in your salon.</p>
<p>Since customer reviews are critical for small businesses, use tablets to provide an opportunity for your customers to leave a review of their experience before they leave. Have stations set-up with tablets to make it easy for happy customers to leave positive feedback while the experience is top of mind.</p>
<figure id="attachment_9592" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9592" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9592" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128.jpg" alt="Point of sale (POS) systems and touch screens" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_541148128-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9592" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Flexible point of sale (POS) systems and touch screens can help you increase efficiency.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invest in a flexible POS (point of sale) system to increase efficiency.</span></h3>
<p>A smooth checkout process is beneficial to both your business efficiency and customer satisfaction, and with a POS system that takes multiple factors and needs into consideration, your small business can increase its revenue. There are a couple of factors to consider when upgrading your POS system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you offer mobile services? Say you have a towing company. With a mobile POS system, your drivers can accept payment from customers on the spot, eliminating paperwork. With plug-and-play options like Square and PayPal, your employees won’t need to carry around special equipment; all they need is a compatible smartphone.</li>
<li>Does your industry have specific needs? Restaurants in particular need to have POS systems that understand the nuances of menu layouts, invoicing, and time clocks. If you have a business with a lot of inventory or multiple locations, you’ll need to invest in a POS system that can accommodate those needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Go green: use equipment loans to become more energy-efficient.</span></h3>
<p>In addition to being environmentally-friendly, having a green business comes with tax incentives. There are a few relatively easy ways to become an eco-friendly business with equipment loans:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buy ENERGYSTAR-qualified equipment. </span>An <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/">ENERGYSTAR</a></span>-rated appliance has been evaluated and deemed energy-efficient, which can save you money and help you manage energy costs.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade to a smart thermostat. </span>With a range of energy-saving features like motion sensors that detect when people are present, smart thermostats can take the hassle out of managing the temperature at your store or place of business while saving you money. Win-win.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch to laptop computers.</span> On average, laptop computers are more efficient and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://michaelbluejay.com/electricity/computers.html">use 80 percent less energy</a></span> than desktop computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the right plan, you can make a lasting impact on your business using equipment financing. Once you have the right tools you need to operate, shift your focus to using equipment loans to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction, and ultimately, your bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_1008812530b-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Construction worker" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_1008812530b-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_1008812530b.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p>Construction spending is surging, hitting a record $1.257 trillion in November, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.commerce.gov/economicindicators">Commerce Department</a></span> reports. But a shortage of qualified construction workers is keeping many construction companies from benefiting from the high demand.</p>
<p>What’s behind the shortage? Demand for new construction dried up during the Great Recession; by 2011, nearly 2.3 million construction industry jobs—over 40% of the industry’s workforce—were gone, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/09/where-did-all-the-construction-workers-go/">The Wall Street Journal</a></span> reports. Meanwhile, seasoned baby boomer construction workers were reaching retirement age.</p>
<p>Although the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/by-all-measures-a-construction-boom-is-shaping-up-for-2018.html">construction industry</a></span> added 210,000 jobs in 2017, hiring still isn’t keeping pace with need. This year, three-fourths of construction companies plan to add employees, but 70% say it’s difficult to find qualified craft workers, such as carpenters, welders, electricians, masons, roofers and plumbers, according to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.agc.org/news/2017/08/29/seventy-percent-contractors-have-hard-time-finding-qualified-craft-workers-hire-amid">survey by the Associated General Contractors of America</a></span>.</p>
<p>The shortage of qualified workers is hitting construction companies where it hurts—in the bottom line. With fewer qualified workers, your firm is more likely to suffer from project delays and poor quality work. The workers you do have will end up working overtime, which costs you money and can lead to dangerous safety slip-ups. Plus, without enough skilled workers to handle potential projects, you’ll lose the opportunity to bid on possible business.</p>
<p>How can you address the shortage of qualified construction workers? Here are 7 tips for attracting and hiring the best.</p>
<h3>1. Work with recruiting specialists.</h3>
<p>Use recruiting companies that specialize in finding construction workers. Not only will you get qualified workers, you&#8217;ll also eliminate the time you&#8217;d normally spend reviewing resumes and checking references.</p>
<h3>2. Widen your net.</h3>
<p>If the same places you normally look for employees aren&#8217;t working for you, broaden your scope. For example, the AGCA survey reports that 79% of construction firms are actively recruiting veterans, 70% are actively recruiting women and 64% are actively recruiting African-Americans.</p>
<h3>3. Increase pay and benefits.</h3>
<p>Half of construction companies the AGCA surveyed have raised base pay rates for craft workers to help fill those jobs; 24% are offering bonuses and incentives; and 20% have increased their employee benefits. Make sure your pay and benefits are competitive for your area.</p>
<h3>4. Focus on safety, and talk about it.</h3>
<p>The construction industry accounts for about 4% of all U.S. workers, but 21% of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">worker deaths</span>. Making your construction business a safer place to work helps you attract better quality employees. No one wants to work for a company that doesn’t value their safety, and for construction workers, one on-the-job injury can end their career. OSHA offers <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.osha.gov/dte/outreach/construction/">safety training courses</a></span> conducted by qualified trainers to help your company maintain safety standards.</p>
<h3>5. Build recruiting pipeline partnerships.</h3>
<p>Partner with local high schools, community colleges, trade and vocational schools to reach out to young people interested in construction work careers. See if your state or local government offers programs to encourage students to enter skilled trades.</p>
<h3>6. Bring more training in-house.</h3>
<p>Entry-level employees interested in construction work may have the right skills, but lack construction experience. You can get over this obstacle by providing high quality in-house training. Having older workers mentor younger ones is a great way for workers nearing retirement age to pass on their knowledge. See if your vendors will train your employees in how to install their products properly.</p>
<h3>7. Budget wisely.</h3>
<p>Whether you add more internal training programs, retain a recruiting service, or boost your employees&#8217; wages, attracting the skilled construction workers you need will require an outlay of cash.</p>
<p>Fundbox’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/">small business financing</a></span> options can help you access the money you need when you need it, so your construction business can take advantage of all the opportunities that come your way.</p>

If so, you have no doubt encountered some challenges with maintaining your cash flow during the slower seasons. In this article from our partners at <a href="https://www.lendio.com/">Lendio</a>, guest contributor Andrea Preziotti looks at how to make the most of those slow months, plus how to understand and choose from some of the most popular funding options that keep  businesses like yours going strong.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>An increase in demand for construction services in smaller urban cities has sparked an upmarket request for residential housing and interest from real estate investors.</p>
<p>Last year <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/by-all-measures-a-construction-boom-is-shaping-up-for-2018.html">saw a growth rate of 2.4% in construction spending</a></span>, with a record high of $1.257 trillion across all sectors of real estate, commercial, and residential. This trend is good news for you if you run a construction business, since it’s likely to contribute in-market growth for contractors regardless of location.</p>
<p>In most regions, the peak season of operation for construction is nine months. When you consider that your core business is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.pn-projectmanagement.com/construction-management-blog/avoiding-weather-related-project-delays">highly dependent on weather</a></span>, companies must take a proactive approach to protect their assets and maintain operations year-round.</p>
<p>One consideration, as your customers retreat and business begins to slow, is to allow time to focus on incremental solutions to supplement the leaner months.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Make the Most of Your Down Time</span></h3>
<p>The construction industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors for small business, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.sageworks.com/the-10-fastest/">experiencing a 19% increase in sales YoY</a></span>. Anything you can do to sustain and grow your business is paramount.</p>
<p>Previously, we’ve looked at this from a few angles:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-your-construction-business-finances-shape-2018/">6 ways to get your construction business finances ready for 2018</a></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/10-ways-to-maximize-winter-downtime-in-your-construction-business/">10 ways to maximize winter downtime to grow your construction business</a></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/marketing-your-construction-business/">Tips for marketing your construction business</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>In planning and growing your business, you may discover that your working capital won’t cover your operating expenses. In recent months, companies across several categories in construction work are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sageworks/2017/12/10/construction-industry-data-show-downside-of-building-boom/#32bc9d88338d">waiting longer, on average, for customer payments</a></span>.</p>
<p>Managing cash flow poses one of the most significant challenges for contractors, as you wait for client payments to come through and lack excess funds to pay your bills. If you find yourself in this type of situation, it could be time to explore alternate sources of working capital to keep your business operating smoothly.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Types of Funding Options for Your Construction Business</span></h3>
<p>Fundbox partner Lendio examined the loan data history of the construction businesses it has helped fund. Of the thousands of construction loans Lendio has helped provide, over 90% of them were Lines of Credit, Term Loans, or ACH Loans.</p>
<p>In the construction business, you often don’t get paid until you submit your invoices during the later stages of a job, but you need access to funds so you can bid on other jobs, pay your employees, buy and maintain equipment, and acquire materials to keep your business moving in the meantime.</p>
<p>Because of this, lenders on Lendio’s platform look at more than your credit history or how much cash you have in the bank. To evaluate the whole picture, lenders often take into account bank statements, the jobs you’re currently working on, your invoices, and other information about you and your business.</p>
<p>Whether you are a new business working to bid on an early job or an established construction company trying to float some capital until a big payment comes through, there are several ways to supplement the working capital needs of your construction business.</p>
<p>Once you figure out how much money you’ll need, consider the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-line-of-credit-safety-net/">A business line of credit</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The most flexible solution for all your business needs, a line of credit can help ease the burden of your cash flow, supplementing funds for payroll, restocking inventory, or funding advertising and marketing programs.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://lp.lendio.com/construction-loans?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=PreparationInTheOffSeason&amp;keywords=2">Business loan</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Money in the bank makes anything possible and taking out a business loan provides you with access to cash when you need it. It also helps you plan ahead so there’s less stress in planning to hire a top-notch crew or furnishing materials and labor for a last-minute build.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/">Invoice</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/"> financing</a></span>: Completing the work on, or ahead of schedule can prove to be challenging when there is a delay in payment of services. In this case, consider invoice financing where you can advance your outstanding invoices for funds up front.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seasonal downturns can significantly affect your construction business profits. Proactively developing strategies and considering funding options to implement year-round are solid steps you can take to soften the blow.</p>

Your business also needs a solid foundation, and that starts with your plan for marketing your construction business.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t grow your business if your customers can&#8217;t find you. While the size of a marketing budget differs between companies, the overall strategies are fairly similar.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for marketing <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/solution-construction-companies-cash-flow-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your construction business</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>9 Tips for Marketing Your Construction Business</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Determine the end result<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Begin the process by thinking about your end game. What is your goal with your marketing plan? Do you want to massively expand your customer base? Attract a few high-end clients? Consider your long-term agenda and where you want to take your business. This will determine your target audience and where you need to invest your marketing dollars.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Research your market<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Once you determine your objectives, start collecting data on your target market. This is a great time to analyze your company&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Does <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-get-equipment-financing-for-your-construction-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your construction company</a> service mid-tier clients but fall short in catering to high-end customers? Are there any barriers to expanding? How much capital do you have to invest if your marketing strategies are successful?</p>
<p>Do your homework to figure out what&#8217;s hot in your sector and how you can take advantage of new opportunities on the horizon.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>It&#8217;s all about SEO<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Search engine optimization will generate most of your construction company&#8217;s new leads. The best thing about it? It&#8217;s free. But in order to attract traffic, you need to generate content on your website that employ the keywords customers use when searching for your services.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/?channel=ha&amp;sourceid=awo&amp;subid=us-en-ha-g-aw-c-bk_mv_exa_1!o2-201167645-170095067012-google%20keyword%20planner&amp;gclid=CMPXmvb299ICFUWNfgodKCwOkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Keyword Planner</a> to search for the keywords and phrases your customers use most when looking for your services. Then, start creating web pages, blogs, or even videos that employ those keywords to boost your visibility in online search.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Where are your customers?<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Your customers can&#8217;t respond to ads they don&#8217;t see, so assess which platforms reach your target audience. Are your customers online? Google Adwords or Facebook might be the best investments for you. Catering to the business community? Marketing your construction company in trade magazines or at conferences might be the way to go.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Build your budget<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>No one has an unlimited marketing budget, so spend more on platforms that drive traffic to your business and lighten your spending on sites that offer little return on investment. Be prepared to track your ads to make sure you see results, and tweak each ad to get maximum value.</p>
<p>Need more funds to market your construction company? Set up an account with <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a> to get the cash to meet your immediate needs.</li>

<p>In the construction business, heavy equipment is critical to success, but the cost can be brutal to bear. Unless your budget can spare the cash, you’ll have to find the right equipment financing to fund the purchase. Here’s how.</p>
<h2><strong>Where to find equipment financing</strong></h2>
<p>You can obtain construction equipment financing from banks, credit unions, equipment manufacturing companies, and supply companies, as well as other independent and online lenders. There are three main equipment financing options to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Equipment leasing</li>
<li>Equipment loans</li>
<li>Small business loans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you choose a financing source and option, you’ll need to assess what kind of construction equipment you’ll need. First, determine what type of machinery, vehicles, or other equipment you want to finance. Decide if you’ll want the newest equipment updated regularly, or if you need something built to last. Once you have determined all of your needs, decide which of these three equipment-financing options will be best for you.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Equipment leasing</strong></h3>
<p>By leasing equipment, you can save money and have the benefit of getting the most up-to-date equipment. You can expect lower monthly payments than you would with an equipment or business loan. You also won’t typically have to put a down payment on the equipment to get started.</p>
<p>Leasing is more flexible than a loan, and you can often negotiate terms more easily. For instance, if you find at the end of the lease that you want to keep the equipment, you may be able to purchase the equipment at a reduced price. Or, if you find you don’t need the equipment anymore, you can always return the equipment. You’ll have to pay an early termination fee, but you won’t be stuck making payments on something you no longer need.</p>
<p>Your rental payment will be tax-deductible, but leasing doesn’t provide a depreciation tax benefit. Interest rates also tend to be higher than equipment or small business loans, and you also won’t be building equity as you make payments.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>2. Equipment loan</strong></h3>
<p>With an equipment loan, you own the equipment from day one. Much like a car, once you repay the loan, your equipment can be used as equity toward a new piece of equipment. At the end of the loan, you may be able to arrange a sale-and-leaseback agreement in which you sell equipment to your finance company for cash, then lease the equipment from the lender.</p>
<p>An equipment loan is often easier to get than a small business loan since credit standards are less strict and rely on other factors, such as experience with equipment. Plus, since equipment has inherent collateral, a lender can always get the equipment back to lend or resell. There are tax advantages to own equipment too—you can enjoy a tax deductible on interest and a depreciation tax benefit over time.</p>
<p>Typically, equipment lenders will require a down payment before you receive equipment. However, depending on your assets or equity, you may be able to avoid putting much money—if any—down first. If you have enough assets, the bank will use those assets as collateral and shoulder the entire burden of financing without requiring a down payment. This means, however, in the event of a loan default, your assets may be seized.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Small business loan</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/small-business-loans" target="_blank">Small business loans</a> can be used to pay for equipment as well. The term of the loan should match or be less than the expected lifespan of the equipment. You don’t want to be paying off equipment longer than you use it.</p>
<p>If you opt for a small business loan, look for the lowest annual percentage rates (APR). You can usually get the best rates from banks and credit unions, but you’ll need good credit to qualify. If your credit is less than optimal, your best bet will be with an online small business loan provider. Loans found online will be easier to obtain, but the interest rates are usually higher than those offered by traditional lenders.</p>
<p>Because construction equipment is so expensive and necessary for the industry, you may have to take out very large loans to fund a purchase. This can deplete your ability to borrow money in case you have other business funding needs.</p>
<h2><strong>Final consideration</strong></h2>
<p>Before you choose an equipment financing option for your construction business, you should also consider the type of maintenance needs the equipment will have. Some equipment leases may offer servicing in case of breakdowns or other malfunctions, but others won’t. Still, if you’re willing to pay someone else to fix equipment or if you can do it yourself, then purchasing equipment could be your best option.</p>
