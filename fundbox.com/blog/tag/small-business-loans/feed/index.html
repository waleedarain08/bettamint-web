There are many reasons small business owners seek out loans, but typically speaking, loans are sought to scale the business, and ultimately make it more profitable. This might include investing in real estate, equipment, and inventory purchases, for example.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a small business loan can be an excellent stepping-stone to help you accelerate the growth of your business, many small business owners are unsure where to start or how to get one. There are certainly plenty of available options, but reviewing them all doesn’t have to be a complex process. If you need help getting started, here are five steps you can take to streamline the application process, increase your chances of approval, and ultimately, set your business up for success. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Create a plan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to getting a small business loan, try to adopt the perspective of a bank or lending company. They need to weigh the risk of lending to you and your level of preparation can make all the difference. There is no room for improvisation on a small business loan application, which is why it’s important that you do the necessary homework first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish your reason for borrowing and determine your needs. Create a financial plan that contains a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-calculate-the-true-cost-of-your-small-business-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the funds you will need. Develop a carefully planned </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> containing evidence-based information such as financial forecasts, profit and loss statements, and cash flow records.  Assemble any other supporting documentation you may need to submit with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can include your formal business plan, bank statements, personal identification documents, and similar documentation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Research</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of small business loans, and you’ll need to do your research in order to understand which financing option is the best fit for your needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loans can be vastly different depending on the purpose of the financing and how quickly you need access to it. Get to know the basic information and main differences between some of the core small business loan types: long-term versus short-term, equipment, working capital, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government-backed loans.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Consider the likelihood of approval</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many factors that influence whether you’re eligible to obtain a small business loan. Most lenders will need to pull your credit rating to process your application. The very fact that a potential lender is reviewing your credit history can have an impact on your credit score, so it&#8217;s best to be strategic in deciding what and how many loan applications to make. That said, there are also lenders who do not do a hard credit inquiry and instead consider alternative qualifying criteria such as annual revenue. Understanding how you’ll be assessed and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing accordingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can greatly improve your chances of approval and also spare you wasting time on applications for loans you aren’t likely to qualify for.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Prepare and review documentation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your small business loan application is only as good as your documentation. Even if you have a pristine credit history and an excellent business plan, submitting your application with missing or ill-prepared documentation can cause your application to be rejected. If some of your documentation is older or out of date, be sure to review it prior to submitting your application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Below are some of the documents you may be required to submit: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal financial statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal credit report</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and personal tax returns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business forecast</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State registrations and licenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal documentation (articles of incorporation, commercial leases, franchise agreements, and the like)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Apply</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself ample lead time to apply. The time between application and approval differs depending on various factors, including loan amount, loan type, and lender. Application forms for some traditional providers such as banks and credit unions are lengthy and require extensive supporting paperwork. The wait time to hear back on your loan application from these traditional lenders is also usually lengthy, sometimes ranging from one to six months. However, one way to streamline or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/lenders-secrets-speed-business-loan-approval/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speed up your loan application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to choose an online lender like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as they can generally provide you with a credit decision in minutes. This is because online lenders typically utilize the latest digital software and automate the application process to ensure it is quick and efficient. Nonetheless, preparing ahead of time, as outlined here, will help you tackle the application with greater ease and efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let costs or unfavorable terms catch you by surprise. Be sure to carefully read all the fine print. Be on the lookout for application fees, early repayment fees, late repayment fees, and SBA loan guarantee fees — all these can have an effect on your annual percentage rate (APR). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To-do list for your small business loan application</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a one-pager of your business profile and include:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long you’ve been in business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many employees you have</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax ID number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average gross annual revenue</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a cash flow analysis on your business account</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand and be able to explain your business credit history</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect at least 3 months of bank statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get business references</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1" aria-checked="false"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare tax statements</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many small business owners seek out loans to accelerate the growth of their business. You may be unsure where to start or how to get one. While there are many available options, reviewing them all doesn’t have to be a complex process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking on a small business loan is a big commitment and it’s normal to be a bit apprehensive. Business owners typically wear many different hats and have much going on, so their time must be spent wisely. You don’t want to invest valuable time putting together a loan application only to have it denied. It’s best to approach it with careful consideration and proper preparation. With planning, research, and proper documentation in hand, you can ease your way through the process, save time, and increase the odds of approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small business loan can be an important step forward for your small business, helping to set you up for ongoing business growth and success. Follow the five steps outlined above to optimize the efficiency of your small business loan application and increase your chances of approval.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve taken the leap into entrepreneurship and it’s time to figure out how to get your business up and running. You need funding to start achieving your goals. If you’re looking at financing options, a startup business loan is a great solution that allows you to build your business’s credit history, which will help you qualify for other types of credit in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional bank loans can be difficult for entrepreneurs to secure until they have a solid business history and strong business credit. Because many small businesses are underserved by banks, there are plenty of other options available to new businesses looking for financing to help them get started. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online term loans and business lines of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders can provide similar financing options to banks, including term loans and business lines of credit, with significantly streamlined application and approval processes. However, most online lenders require you to be in business for at least six months, as credit decisions are based on your financial history (as opposed to projections). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, look for lenders that offer flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and loan options for growing businesses with reasonable interest and annual percentage rates (APR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on loans from online lenders typically start at about </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/blog/what-is-the-average-business-loan-interest-rate-37650/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Also consider your repayment terms, to ensure that you can make your regularly scheduled payments without disrupting your cash flow. The more structured your repayment plan, the more likely you are to pay off your loan in time without extra financial burden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans from local community organizations </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best places to look for funding, especially when you’re at the beginning of your business journey, is your local business and economic development organizations and nonprofit groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders like these can provide resources, education, and networking opportunities alongside financing options. They have a vested interest in helping local businesses thrive and can point you towards different funding opportunities as you expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide access to loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) as well as funds from other lending programs such as the </span><a href="http://www.toryburchfoundation.org/programs/capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory Burch Foundation Capital Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides financing for women entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and municipal business development programs also provide startup business loans, so check your local government websites for options. For example, New York state offers the </span><a href="https://esd.ny.gov/metropolitan-economic-revitalization-fund-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund (MERF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses that are creating jobs in low-income areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also many microlenders across the country who work with startups and small businesses to help them get off the ground. Microlenders like </span><a href="https://www.pacificcommunityventures.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacific Community Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in California and </span><a href="https://www.liftfund.com/loan-offerings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LiftFund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which serves the southeastern U.S., provide access to SBA loans and other financing opportunities alongside educational resources. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset-based financing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a limited business credit history or </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/small-business/startup-business-loans-bad-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a low credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, secured, asset-based financing options like invoice factoring, merchant cash advances, and loans against specific collateral can help you get the financing you need as a startup. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of financing where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party who in turn provides a sum of cash equal to a portion of the invoice amounts. Your clients then pay their invoices to the factoring company. This type of financing works well if you already have a high volume of outstanding invoices in your accounts receivables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/merchant-cash-advance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant cash advance,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’re provided with a sum of money up front that you pay down with a percentage of your credit card sales. This financing option carries one of the highest interest rates, since it does not typically rely on your credit, but is instead based on your everyday customer credit card transactions. This option works best if your customers pay you primarily with credit cards.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-does-equipment-financing-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the best ways for new businesses to get the machinery and vehicles they need to get started because they use the equipment itself as collateral — similar to a mortgage. You can also leverage </span><a href="https://na.doosanequipment.com/en/news-stories/the-cutting-edge/buy-rent-or-lease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leasing and rent-to-own options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the equipment you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a business owner with a low personal credit score who’s looking for financing, be wary of lenders who say that they will guarantee approval without looking at your business credit or financial standing in any capacity, as these options can turn out to be expensive or untrustworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also keep in mind that some lenders will perform what’s known as a </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-hard-inquiry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard inquiry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “hard pull” on your credit report that may negatively impact your credit score, potentially preventing you from securing funding. If several hard inquiries appear on your credit report in a short period of time, you may be less likely to be approved. Online lenders, including Fundbox, take a look at your financial history and only perform what’s known as a soft pull on your credit report when you apply, which will not affect your credit score. Be sure to look for lenders that offer a balance of flexibility around credit requirements and security around repayment terms and interest rates when it comes to securing financing. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) microloans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA provides </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $50,000 for small businesses to start up and expand. SBA microloans are provided by intermediary, nonprofit lenders who often have a mandate to support small businesses with a focus on minority- and women-owned businesses. This can make it easier for </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/sba-microloans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">startups and early-stage small businesses to qualify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the funding they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders who facilitate SBA funding will have their own terms for the loan, but interest rates are typically between 8 and 13 percent with a maximum repayment term of six years. You can use microloans for most of your business needs, including working capital, inventory, supplies, and equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowers need to have a credit score of at least 640, but some lenders offer loans to borrowers with </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/sba-microloan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scores as low as 575.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proving that you have steady revenue, providing collateral, and leveraging a cosigner can help you secure a loan even if you have a low credit score. Be aware that it can take around two to three weeks or more to get approval for a microloan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans are typically easier for new businesses to obtain than the SBA 7(a) loan, a popular option for established businesses with more credit history who need up to $5 million in financing. To see if microloans are the right option for your business, you can </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find?type=SBA%20District%20Office&amp;pageNumber=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search here for your local SBA office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business loans can boost long-term growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in your business will pay off as you grow. Startup business loans empower you to build a business you’re proud of with the right resources, equipment, and team members. With financing options that meet your needs, you can feel confident about taking on business debt to achieve your goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify for a business line of credit from Fundbox and get financing to take your business to the next level.</span></p>

Hatching a bright business idea is one thing, but finding the funding to bring it to life is another matter altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, money is a key ingredient in the recipe for startup success, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/are-you-a-startup-or-a-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing is a critical component</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in getting your business off the ground. Securing small business startup funding can be especially challenging and may simply feel out of reach due to the restrictive requirements of traditional business loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let that put a damper on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/create-a-business-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While finding the funds to nurture your startup can be tricky and trying at times, it&#8217;s not a lost cause — in fact, far from it. There are still plenty of great startup business loans and other ’money trees’ for you to explore. To help you better navigate them, we’ve prepared a breakdown of the best funding options for beginners. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free money to start a business? Sounds like a dream come true or, possibly, just too good to be true. Fortunately, business grants are not a myth, and a number of government-backed and private grant options exist for startup businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some potential drawbacks, however. Given their very nature, grants are a competitive option. The application process is sometimes lengthy and labor intensive, and there are rigid rules around how ‌‌funds are used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of grant funding options for you to explore online, including, for example, </span><a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and others such as the Small Business Innovation Research program, or the Small Business Technology Transfer program.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partners with lenders to provide loans to startups and small businesses. Rather than lending directly, the SBA guarantees a percentage of the loan, which helps startup businesses obtain loans with desirable rates and terms that are otherwise extremely rare for a new business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA microloan program partners with nonprofit, community-based lenders to provide startup loans of up to $50,000.</span></p>
<p><b>Non-monetary benefits</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will likely enjoy face-to-face interaction in the form of mentorship, which is a key advantage of SBA microloans. Typically, microloan providers will pair you with other startup founders who can offer advice on a range of topics; for example, finance, business strategy, marketing, and more.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that mentored startups </span><a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/startup-world-mentorship"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise seven times more money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their independent counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore all SBA loan options and resources </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup business loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A startup business loan is a financing option created to help cover the costs associated with starting a new business. Typically, these funds can be leveraged for supplies, working capital, equipment, real estate, inventory, machinery, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One drawback to consider is that there are usually many hoops to jump through to qualify for loans from traditional lenders. Strict eligibility requirements and rigid terms mean these loans are often outside the realm of possibility for early stage startups. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lines of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit provides access to revolving capital, similar to a credit card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are often used to cover short-term financial needs, which can include everything from inventory purchases to product development. One key advantage of a business line of credit is that interest is only charged on the amount spent rather than the full credit limit. As with loans, business lines of credit from banks have rigid requirements for startups. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing is generally a more cost-effective option for startups that are seeking out funds with the specific intent of purchasing the physical equipment needed to run their businesses. This type of financing excludes real estate but instead applies to physical assets such as machinery, computers, servers, vehicles, and similar equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the loan is approved, the equipment you purchase then serves as collateral for the lender. This means that the lender can repossess the asset if the loan defaults for non-payment. Equipment financiers generally cover a percentage of the equipment, or even the full cost, and in some cases pay out the loan amount directly to the equipment vendor(s). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If equipment financing sounds like a fit for your business, you may want to check out equipment financing companies such as </span><a href="https://www.elease.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eLease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investor</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An angel investor is typically a high-net-worth individual who funds startups needing access to funding in the early stages of growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest their own money in your business, usually in exchange for a percentage of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/#h-selling-equity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means there’s little risk and no loan to repay if the business fails; instead, if your business succeeds your angel investor takes a share of company profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors are often successful entrepreneurs with extensive startup experience. This added mentorship can be extremely valuable and helpful in shaping the long-term success of a business. However, unless extremely lucky, finding an angel investor isn’t a quick process. It can take multiple time-consuming concept pitches and rejections, and even then, doesn’t always pan out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re considering an angel investor as an avenue for funding, it may be beneficial to brush up your knowledge of the process and learn how to perfect your pitch. Here are some helpful resources to get you started:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepitch.uk/prepare-pitch-angel-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Prepare a Pitch for Angel Investors</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.harvest.builders/insights/how-to-find-angel-investors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Find and Pitch Angel Investors: The Founder&#8217;s Guide</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture Capitalists (VCs)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike angel investors, who invest their own money, a VC is an outside group that raises capital from limited partners and takes shares of the startup in exchange for funding. Percentages of ownership are negotiable and are usually based on a company&#8217;s valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of a VC are not all financial. Similar to angel investors, VCs can provide an abundance of knowledge, industry connections, and business direction. But the chances of receiving VC funding are quite slim for brand new startups. VCs seek businesses with a rare combination of product and market opportunity that are likely to increase in value rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in obtaining VC backing, check out </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/03/how-venture-capitalists-make-decisions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Venture Capitalists Make Decisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/#h-crowdfunding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of startup funding that doesn’t require a business to fulfill the qualifications that a traditional lender will insist upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offer equity to attract investors through a crowdfunding platform, so application forms, credit scores, collateral, and similar requirements of traditional lenders are not needed. Crowdfunding is a financing option best suited to startup businesses raising smaller sums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in exploring crowdfunding as a financing option for your startup, there are multiple platforms to consider. Some of the top crowdfunding platforms include </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kickstarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/about/what-we-do#/funding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiegogo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.fundable.com/raise-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast funding for your growing business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an entrepreneur, you’re the only one who knows your goals — and your timetable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re willing to give up equity and have time to invest in the search for grant funding, crowdfunding, or investor pitches, then it could make sense to explore those options further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re looking to level up your already growing business, you could be better off applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">term loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If approved, you’ll have quick access to the money you need to move forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking fast and flexible financing for your growing business? </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to see if you qualify for a business line of credit or term loan from Fundbox. </span></p>

Loans enable you to make purchases for your business, hire team members, and cover your everyday expenses as you scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing a loan isn’t always straightforward and the process can be time-consuming, especially if you choose a traditional lender like a bank. In this article, we’ll share some of the processes and requirements for most loan applications so that you can get a better idea of what goes into applying for a business loan before you get started. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your business ready for a loan </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do before you apply for a loan is to determine exactly how you’ll use the funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need financing right away to cover immediate expenses like payroll or rent, you’ll need to look for a loan option that offers a quick approval process and more </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible business credit.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a large sum to invest in your first piece of equipment, you might want to look for loans that use that purchase as collateral if you do not have any other assets yet. Many lenders need you to detail how you’ll use the loan, so this step will help you build your case going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next thing to take a look at is your business’s current financial position. Ensure that your business and personal finances are clearly separated to get a full picture of how the business is doing. Lenders will be looking into your financial history and your past and projected sales as part of the approval process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check both your personal and business </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/credit-score-for-business-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from reporting agencies like Dun &amp; Bradstreet, TransUnion, and Equifax. Pay down your current debt, including balances on your business and personal credit cards. Using </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-best-percentile-for-credit-utilization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 to 30 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your credit can help boost your credit score. Making sure that you’re in good financial standing with your suppliers and catching up on past-due accounts can also help you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-hacks-building-business-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly boost your credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your creditworthiness affects whether you’ll be approved for the loan, but keep in mind that it also affects the annual percentage rate (APR) you’ll pay on the loan. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better your credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the lower your interest rates will be. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the application process </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the factors you should look at before applying for a loan is the application process itself. Depending on the lender, you could be spending more time and resources than you bargained for preparing an application and waiting for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional bank loans and loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) typically have the most involved application processes and you might have to wait for a credit decision. Loans from online lenders tend to have applications you can complete in minutes to receive a fast credit decision. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for a bank loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans aren’t always the best option for small businesses, in part because the application process is so rigorous. Banks can offer the best APR to businesses with a credit score of 750 or higher, a strong history of revenue, and several years in operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can still qualify for bank loans with a score between 700-749, but you’ll need to build a good case for your business. Part of the application process is presenting a business plan and detailing how the funds will be used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks also require you to provide information like sales, sales projections, expenses, and cash flow. They need to be sure your cash flow will accommodate regular payments on the loan.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for an SBA-backed loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans — including the SBA 7(a) loan, CDC/504 loan, and microloans — are provided through banks and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). The SBA provides some guidelines and requirements for these loans, but lenders also have their own eligibility requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To apply for an SBA loan, you’ll need to have a credit score of at least 680 and provide thorough documentation that includes your business tax returns, profit and loss statement, loan application history, business licenses and registration, and the resumes of your principal leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that the SBA loan application process can take </span><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/sba-loan-approval-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 30 to 90 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the loan you’re applying for and the lender you choose. SBA Preferred Lenders can process applications faster, but expect to wait a month at minimum for approval. The best way to speed up the approval process is to have all of your documentation in order. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for loan from an online lender</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online lenders and fintech platforms offer term loans as well as lines of credit, merchant cash advances, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and financing. One of the benefits of online platforms is that the application process is significantly quicker and simpler than applying for a loan from a traditional lender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fundbox’s application process requires you to answer a few questions about your business and connect your business checking account and accounting software. A credit decision is made in as little as three minutes, and you can receive funds in your account within three business days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to credit score requirements, most online lenders, including Fundbox, look for scores above 600. Some </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and merchant cash advance providers will not take your credit score into account at all, but you’ll be on the hook for a steeper APR.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, as you shop around for loan options, keep in mind that taking on debt will cost you. Advertised interest rates likely will not reflect your APR, which includes additional charges like origination fees and ongoing service fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing exactly how you’ll use your loan will come in handy when you’re deciding how much money you’d like. Choosing the loan amount that fits your needs can save you money in the future. Many lenders charge prepayment fees, which means that even if you do not use the full loan amount, you have to continue to repay on a regular basis for the remainder of your repayment term if you want to avoid this penalty.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not a direct cost to you, bear in mind that secured loans require collateral. Equipment loans or mortgages use the property itself as collateral while loans for other purchases are usually secured with a UCC-1 or “blanket” lien, which uses all your business assets as collateral. It can be extremely costly to replace your assets if they are repossessed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some loans, including SBA loans, also require a personal guarantee, which means that personal assets are used as collateral, too. Unsecured loans do not require collateral, but you’ll pay much higher interest rates.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to apply for a business loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers term loans and lines of credit up to $150,000* for small businesses that need funding quickly. Term loans</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">†</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are paid over 24 or 52 weeks and there are no origination or prepayment penalties.

Many small businesses need to take out loans or leverage credit to fund their operations, especially when they first start out. The Small Business Administration (SBA) reports that about </span><a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are financed by loans and credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have multiple debts that you’re repaying to different accounts or institutions, you might consider business debt consolidation. Debt consolidation is the process of taking out a single loan to pay off all of your existing debts. It differs from refinancing in that you’re looking to pay off all of your separate debts at once, rather than taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate to pay off a higher-interest loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating your business debt can save you time, so you aren’t keeping up with different repayment schedules for multiple loans or credit balances. With a single interest rate and the right repayment terms, it can also help you save money.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to determine if debt consolidation is right for you</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidating loans is not a magic bullet for your financial challenges. The intention is to make repaying your debt more manageable with a single payment due date, a reliable payment amount, and one interest rate. There are a few things you should think about before choosing to consolidate your business debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start, calculate how much interest you’re currently paying on all of your debt. While interest is not the only factor you need to keep in mind when choosing your consolidation loan, it’s great to save yourself some money with a lower interest payment. Interest rates are dependent on your personal and business credit scores, so take that into account when you’re looking into debt consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, figure out if your cash flow will cover your consolidated loan payments. If having multiple repayment dates with differing amounts throughout the month will help ensure that you have enough to cover your bills, it may not make sense to consolidate the loans into one payment that will prohibit you from paying for other expenses on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure that you can afford your consolidated repayment is critical to avoid expensive late fees. Late payments can also take a toll on your credit score, preventing you from getting good interest rates on future loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering business debt consolidation, take stock of your borrowing and spending history. Review your habits and assess whether you need to implement some more effective business spending strategies. Additionally, you should not use loan consolidation to address personal debt. The primary reason for this is tax compliance. Failure to keep your personal and business expenses separate could make it difficult to get financing in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to consolidate your business debt </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several options for consolidating business debt, including bank loans, Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, lines of credit, and funding from online financial platforms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a bank loan is one of the best ways to consolidate business debt, qualifying for one can be a challenge. You often need to be in business for several years and have a great credit score. You also need to have strong, proven revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do meet the qualifications, bank loans usually offer interest rates lower than 10% and repayment terms of ten years and under with monthly payments. Be aware that banks typically charge prepayment penalties if you plan to pay your loan off early. Smaller regional banks or banks with great small business advisory programs can help guide your choices and help you determine the most beneficial ways to consolidate and repay your debt. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-1-sba-7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 7(a) loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only SBA loan that you can use to consolidate debt. It’s a flexible funding option you can use for any type of debt. It provides a loan amount of up to $5 million, and repayment terms do not typically exceed ten years (25 years for real estate loans). The interest rate is between 5–10% and you’ll make your payments monthly. There’s no prepayment penalty for loans with repayment terms under 15 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few restrictions to be aware of with the SBA 7(a) loan option: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The purpose of the loans you want to consolidate has to be eligible under the SBA 7(a) guidelines. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA 7(a) loan payment amount needs to be at least 10% less than that of your current loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to put together a written explanation for each of your current loans for why they don’t have reasonable terms.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use the SBA 7(a) loan to pay off your business credit cards as part of your debt consolidation. In the wake of the pandemic, the SBA is also offering the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-08/COVIDEIDL_FAQs-508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which enables you to cover your current regular debt or credit card payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans and lines of credit from online financial platforms</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of traditional financial institutions, other lending options include online financial platforms. These lenders offer loans and lines of credit and are a great choice for businesses that do not qualify for bank or SBA loans. A big plus is online financial platforms make it easy to get a loan or line of credit approved as quickly as possible without jumping through hoops during the application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers both </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">term loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you consolidate your business debt. A term loan can be repaid in installments over a 24 or 52-week plan. Lines of credit allow you to take advantage of as much or as little credit as you need with 12 or 24-week repayment plans. Interest rates vary depending on your business history and the payment term you choose. There are no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Fundbox’s structured repayment plans help you stay on track by requiring you to pay equal installments on a regular basis, ensuring that you pay off your consolidated debt as quickly as possible, without compromising your cash flow. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to look for in a debt consolidation loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing is to ensure you can secure a loan that covers all of the outstanding debts you’re looking to consolidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you compare loan options, make sure you’re aware of any upfront or ongoing costs of your new loan. There may be fees for late payments and paying off the loan early. Other costs could include balance transfer fees, loan origination fees, and annual fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-term loans allow you to pay your debt slowly in smaller chunks, making it easy for you to make full payments on time and promoting healthy cash flow. Keep in mind that you may end up paying more interest over time than you would with a shorter repayment period. Understand how cash flow works in your business to get the most out of your repayment terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that low interest rates aren’t always guaranteed and that a low interest rate doesn’t indicate you’re getting a good deal. Shop around for the lowest interest rate you can find, but take into account what the lender is asking for in terms of collateral and guarantees in the case of default. Will your personal assets be on the line? You can always consider refinancing your consolidated loan in the future to take advantage of lower interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important point to keep in mind is how long you’re planning to take to repay your consolidated loan. A low interest rate over a longer repayment period might cost you the same as a loan with a higher interest rate you’re planning to pay off quickly. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing your consolidated loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, maintaining positive cash flow is more important for business longevity than paying back debt as quickly as you can. If you’ve found a loan with a favorable interest rate for a long-term repayment plan, focus on making your regular payments and ensure that your remaining income can cover all of your other regular expenses. Reinvest anything above that into building your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s paramount that you make your payments on time and in full. The purpose of loan consolidation is to make your life in business easier. Regularly paying down your consolidated loan balance keeps your business healthy, improves your credit score over time, and looks great to potential investors, other lenders, or buyers––if you choose to sell your business in the future.</span></p>

In the U.S., minorities make up 32 percent of the population,</span><a href="https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/minorityentrepreneurs#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%2010%20years,totaling%20close%20to%20%24700%20billion."><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but only 18 percent of business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority business owners face their own set of unique obstacles when running their businesses. From access to education to equity, communication, and cultural factors, there are several systemic barriers that can create challenges for minority business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://archive.mbda.gov/page/executive-summary-disparities-capital-access-between-minority-and-non-minority-businesses.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed by the Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency found that sufficient access to capital remains a key factor in limiting the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority-owned businesses. Findings from the same report showed that minority-owned businesses are less likely to receive funding and, if approved, receive smaller loans and higher interest rates than their non-minority counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority business owners are often faced with more institutional barriers to funding, such as limited banking options, insufficient credit history, and implicit bias. In addition, minority business owners are less likely to apply for funding due to </span><a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/breaking-barriers-to-credit-and-capital-access-for-black-latinx-and-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fear of rejection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can mean they miss out on equal funding opportunities or resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding what financing options are available can help business owners during difficult times and times of growth. There are different programs and loans designed specifically for minority-owned businesses. These options can provide a vital source of funding to help traditionally underserved communities launch or grow an existing business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Funding for Minority-Owned Businesses</span></h2>
<h4><b>Loans vs. grants</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans refer to money borrowed with the expectation of paying it back (most often with interest) over a set and agreed-upon period of time. Loans are broadly available and offer flexibility in terms of eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants offer funding with no expectation of repayment; however, they are less common than loans. Because they are few and far between, business owners can expect most grant programs to be highly competitive. </span></p>
<h4><b>What are loans for minority-owned businesses? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are loans that are specifically designated for businesses owned and operated by minorities, designed to increase funding access to traditionally underserved communities. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to minority-owned business loans. There are many options, and loans are available from a variety of different providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of these loans is to level the playing field for minority-owned businesses and improve their chances of accessing the necessary capital to start, operate, or grow their businesses.</span></p>
<h4><b>What you need to qualify for a minority-owned business loan</b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business must be minority-owned. That usually means a business must be at least 51 percent owned or operated by a person belonging to Black, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian, or other racial or ethnic group(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some federal loans and programs for minorities require your business to first apply for and obtain </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority business enterprise certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprofits and other entities that are not connected with the government also create and extend loans. Loan qualification requirements vary depending on the loan and the lender.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these programs and loans require lengthy applications and paperwork, plus a high FICO (credit) score or collateral. In some cases, you’re only eligible for financing with a business history of at least two years.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Minority-Owned Business Loans to Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you Google ‘minority-owned business loans,’ you’ll find pages and pages of results. Seeking out the right loan for your business can be overwhelming. There are a variety of options available, but as with other types of financing, eligibility and terms vary. Some are more favorable than others. Here are some of the best minority loan options to consider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Small Business Administration is a federal entity created to foster small business growth. </span></p>
<h4><b>SBA Community Advantage Loans</b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/partners/lenders/7a-loan-program/pilot-loan-programs#section-header-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA Community Advantage (CA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loans help small businesses in underserved markets. Under this pilot program, minority-owned businesses can receive up to $250,000 with a maximum interest rate of prime plus six percent. The SBA guarantees 85 percent for loans up to $150,000, and 75 percent for loans larger than $150,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA CA loan terms vary depending on how you use the funds: Loan terms for equipment and working capital may extend up to 10 years, while those for real estate may extend up to 25 years. These loans are a decent option for new businesses, as well as those with below-average credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To apply for a CA loan you’ll need to contact an </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-carl-lenders-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved lender in your area.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Approved lenders include community development corporations, SBA-authorized microloan providers, and community development financial institutions. </span></p>
<h4><b>SBA Microloans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/loans-grants/see-what-sba-offers/sba-loan-programs/microloan-program%20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are open to all businesses, but are a good option for new minority small business owners or those seeking loans of $50,000 or less. The SBA microloan program offers up to $50,000 with seven-year maximum terms and interest rates typically ranging from 6 percent to 9 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These microloans are made available through third-party lenders. To apply, you must work with an </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/microlenderrpt5_20170621.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA-approved intermediary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. Approved intermediaries make all credit decisions on SBA microloans.</span></p>
<h4><b>SBA 7(a) Loans</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7(a) loan program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the SBA&#8217;s primary program for providing financial assistance to small businesses. The program is not designed specifically for minorities; however, a third of the 7(a) loans go to minority-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rates on SBA 7(a) loans are some of the lowest you’ll find, allowing minority business owners to invest more profits in growth rather than paying off debt. You can qualify for up to $5 million with a repayment term of between 10 and 25 years. To apply for a 7(a) loan, you need to complete an application with an SBA lending partner, like a bank or credit union. The lender will submit your application to the SBA to receive a loan guarantee; this way, if you are unable to pay the loan, the SBA will repay the guaranteed amount to the lender.</span></p>
<h4><b>SBA 8(a) Business Development Program</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not technically a loan, the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 8(a) Business Development Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps minority-owned businesses gain access to federal contracts. Each year, the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-minorities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program’s goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to award at least 5 percent of federal contracting dollars to small, underserved businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program is a valuable resource for minority small business owners who have been in business for at least two years and are interested in expanding their footprint in the federal marketplace. To qualify for this program, the business must be 51 percent owned by someone from a socially and economically underserved background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the applicant business owner’s personal net worth and average gross income for the last three years must be $250,000 or less, with assets valued at $4 million or less. Businesses interested in applying for 8(a) certification can take a preliminary assessment </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program#section-header-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine whether the 8(a) program is right for them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprofit Loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not always minority-specific, there are many nonprofit organizations that offer loans to small businesses. </span></p>
<h4><b>The Business Consortium Fund (BCF)</b></h4>
<p><a href="https://bcfcapital.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit organization and community development financial institution (CDFI). The BCF provides financing exclusively for minority business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans range from $100,000 to $750,000 with a maximum loan term of five years — interest rates depend on the risk analysis. To be eligible, you must certify your business as a minority business enterprise through the </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></a></p>
<h4><b>The Accion Opportunity Fund (AOF)</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://aofund.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supports small businesses that advance racial, gender, and economic justice. This program offers loans from $5,000 to $100,000 and interest rates as low as 5.99 percent. AOF loans are targeted at low- to moderate-income business owners and 60 percent of AOF borrowers come from minority communities. </span></p>
<h4><b>Kiva </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.kiva.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit organization and technology platform that enables crowdfunded loans for borrowers who are either financially excluded or creating social impact in their communities. Eligible business owners can qualify for </span><a href="https://www.kivaushub.org/kivaprocess"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to $15,000 in no-interest financing.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Loan Options for Minority Small Businesses</span></p>
<h4><b>Accompany Capital</b></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.nybcna.org/bcna/microloans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accompany Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides short-term loans up to $50,000 to minority business owners based in New York City. They offer low, fixed interest rates, but loans must be paid back within six months to three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses are eligible, and there is no minimum credit score required to qualify for these minority business loans.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Union Bank Diversity Lending Program</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><a href="https://www.unionbank.com/business/lending/diversity-lending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers up to $2.5 million in financing that is specifically designated for businesses that are at least 51 percent owned by women, veterans, and minority business owners. To qualify, businesses must be in operation for two years or more and annual sales cannot exceed $20 million. The program provides flexible loan types and terms; however, it’s limited to businesses operating in Arizona, California, Oregon, or Washington only. </span></p>
<h4><b> United States Department of Agriculture business loans</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Agriculture </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/federal/federal-funding/department-agriculture-business-and-industry-bi-guaranteed-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guarantees business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small businesses, companies, nonprofits, and other organizations located in rural communities. These loans are not tailored exclusively to minority-owned businesses, but can be a valuable option for those based in rural areas. The maximum loan amount is $10 million, and terms can differ based on how the funds are used. Interest rates are set by the lender but must fall within a maximum limit set by the USDA. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are loans specifically for minority businesses, many business owners do not have time to wait for these options. Many of these programs and loans require lengthy applications and paperwork, as well as a high FICO score or collateral. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the process of applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-loan-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you may find yourself in the situation where you need to find a cosigner for the loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what does a cosigner do, how do you find one, and what’s involved? Let’s look at what a business loan cosigner does and the pros and cons of having one.</span></p>
<p><b>What does a cosigner do?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial institutions consider small businesses a high-risk investment due to their lack of credit history and </span><a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/24153946/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2019-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high failure rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As such they may require a cosigner on the loan. It’s a serious obligation. A cosigner doesn’t just cosign your loan, the lender can require them to repay it – and any associated late fees, fines, and penalties – if you default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to helping you secure a loan, using a cosigner may improve your chances of getting a favorable interest rates, flexible repayment terms, or access to more funds. A small business loan cosigner can also mitigate the need for you to put up </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/can-i-get-a-small-business-loan-without-collateral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collateral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as security.</span></p>
<p><b>How to get a cosigner </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cosigner is typically someone with excellent credit history or significant assets (since they may be required to provide collateral such as property, in exchange for financing). Ideally, that individual is someone you trust, such as a family member or friend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosigning services are available from organizations or professionals for a fee but should always be approached with caution and the terms of the services closely scrutinized.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, you’ll need to make a compelling case to secure a cosigner. They will want to be confident that you have a well thought out </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/become-an-entrepreneur/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and financial plan, including a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re already an established business, be prepared to share your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet and income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as your P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><b>What is the cosign process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank will advise you whether you should find a cosigner for your small business loan. Once you’ve identified that person, they will complete the loan application process alongside you. Once approved, the cosigner must accept and sign the loan agreement.  </span></p>
<p><b>What are the risks of having a cosigner on your loan?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cosigner doesn’t pose any risks to you or your business. However, if you fail to keep up with loan repayments and the bank calls on your cosigner to pay, then it could seriously damage your relationship – especially if your cosigner is a family member or friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also consider how your cosigner’s credit score might impact your ability to secure a loan, the amount the bank will approve, and the lending terms. </span></p>
<p><b>What to do if you can’t find a cosigner</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosigning is risky and not for everyone. If you’re concerned that your credit score may impact your chances of being approved for a small business loan, there are alternatives to entering into a cosigned loan agreement. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improve your business credit score:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It takes time, but actions such as making timely payments, paying off debt, and maintaining a low credit utilization ratio can help improve your credit score and chances of a successful loan application. For more tips, check out these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-business-credit-score/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Ways to Increase Your Business Credit Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Apply for a business line of credit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> works similarly to a credit card and can be used to make purchases for your business, such as stocking up on inventory or paying for marketing programs. Unlike other forms of financing, you don’t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you use.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to a business line of credit quickly and with relatively little administrative work. For example, with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can apply online and get a credit decision in minutes. Unlike a traditional business loan application, you won’t have to complete any paperwork to get started. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there’s no impact to your credit score just for applying.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consider an SBA loan: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a variety of small business loans that are partly guaranteed by the government. This makes them a useful option for small business owners who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for financing. Learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, always consider the pros and cons of having a cosigner on your small business loan. Weigh up other financing options first. If you determine you could benefit from a cosigned loan, apply for a smaller amount, and pay it off diligently. This will help improve your business credit score and boost your chances of getting a business loan the next time you need funds – without the need for collateral or a cosigner. </span></p>

When it comes to loans, there are two major types: unsecured and secured.</p>
<p>The primary difference between secured and unsecured loans is that a secured loan requires an asset to act as security. In other words, it’s a collateral business loan that requires you to put something up in exchange for financing (e.g., commercial real estate or a company car).</p>
<p>An unsecured loan is a no-collateral loan that has no such requirement. While there are some business loans available that require no collateral, they are not as easy to find nor as readily available as a standard secured loan.</p>
<p>While we cannot advise on which is better for you, it’s helpful to understand both options if you’re seeking business funding.</p>
<h2>How do traditional secured loans work?</h2>
<p>Most people are familiar with the idea of a secured loan since they may already use lending of this type as consumers.</p>
<p>A mortgage, for example, is the best-known secured loan, with the collateral being your home. If you fail to make your mortgage payments, eventually, the lender would be able to repossess the property.</p>
<p>The whole point of setting up a secured loan is to reduce the lender’s risk. This is why so many lenders prefer to only offer this type of loan, especially to new startups that are inherently riskier.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to collateral, or collateral under another name?</h2>
<p>If you are looking for a no-collateral loan, there are limited options. And, even then, many lenders still reduce their risk through other requirements that give them leverage in case of default, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal guarantee: If you take out a loan with a personal guarantee instead of a specific item of collateral, you will be making a guarantee that you, as an individual, will pay the debt should your company default on the loan.</li>
<li>A blanket UCC lien: This is another option when lenders do not ask for a particular item of collateral. A blanket UCC lien may be placed on the business. That means should it default on its payments, the lender can then pursue the company’s assets as compensation for the remaining unpaid sum.</li>
</ul>
<p>While neither of these options is something to discount from the equation completely, it is important to have a full understanding of what they entail for you and your company before signing on the dotted line.</p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9675" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg" alt="Weighing your business funding options" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How difficult is it to get a small business loan without collateral?</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to get an unsecured business loan for your startup or established small business, there are a few options to consider. These include:</p>
<h3>SBA loans</h3>
<p>An SBA loan is backed by a federal agency, the Small Business Administration. This type of loan may or may not require collateral, and even new startups may get a loan with no need for collateral via an approved SBA lender (e.g., Some 7(a) loans for less than $25,000)). There are, however, other SBA loans that will require collateral, so it’s important to check before signing.<br />
Are SBA loans hard to get?<br />
They can be. If you’re looking for a relatively affordable form of lending, SBA loans could be the answer. Remember, though, SBA loans can take more effort to apply for, take longer to process, and they typically have rigorous eligibility requirements for approval.</p>

<h3>Online long-term loans</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many online lenders that offer short-term and long-term loans to companies. While both are “<strong><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/term-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">term loans</a></strong>,” there are some key differences to keep in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, a long-term loan is more traditional. The lender will advance a specific sum that will be repaid monthly over a set period of time. Though generally not as affordable as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sba-loans-supporting-small-businesses-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are relatively affordable and applying is often faster and easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short-term loan, on the other hand, also involves advancing a lump sum to the borrower, but this is then repaid in weekly or daily payments for a short period of around three to 18 months. This type of loan is usually more expensive, although it has relaxed eligibility requirements. It is also very easy to apply for when compared with traditional bank loans.</span></p>
<h3>Merchant cash advances (MCAs)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although merchant cash advances appear to require collateral, they actually do not. In fact, the financing company will only be buying your future assets—nothing you own right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a business receives a merchant cash advance, the financing company is advancing a specified sum that is then paid back using a particular percentage of sales. In essence, it is purchasing a portion of the company’s future sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eligibility requirements for this type of lending are comparatively loose, but there could be a risk to cash flow. It is important to proceed with caution when choosing this option, since many MCAs involve complex contracts and a variety of fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you choose an MCA, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read this article comparing MCAs with SBA loans and business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3>Business credit cards</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit cards</a> are certain to be something you are already familiar with, and they are actually a surprisingly good way of financing a business—especially when supplementing a traditional loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A zero percent introductory APR card is typically the best option since this is essentially an interest-free loan that lasts for the duration of the specified introductory period. This will vary by card and could be as long as 15 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose this option, having a clear repayment plan in place is essential since you will need to pay off the balance before the introductory period ends and the regular APR kicks in.</span></p>
<h3>Private lenders and fintech firms</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, there are a lot of private lenders out there who are willing to offer loans without collateral, as long as the business owner offers a personal guarantee. This could be in the form of a cosigner, an asset or a commodity. Although, strictly speaking, this is not quite an unsecured loan, there are many more options for the commodities or assets that you can use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to financing quickly and with relatively little paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can apply for financing online without any specific collateral, and expect a credit decision in just minutes (3 minutes, actually, based on the median decision time for Fundbox customers). All Fundbox customers are subject to UCC-1 blanket liens. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/#how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about how Fundbox loans work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Weighing the options</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When taking out a loan to fund your business, consider whether you really prefer an option that requires no collateral and why. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re concerned you may default and end up having your assets seized by the lender, it may not be the right time to seek financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think you’ll be in a more secure financial position soon? Or do you really need that financing now, in order to improve your position and save your business? If you are feeling confident in the future success of your operation, you might choose to wait and apply for a no-collateral loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, sometimes you’re not worried about losing your assets at all. Instead, you might be more concerned with speed and the ease of getting funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some owners spend 30 hours or more on paperwork just to apply for a conventional term loan to fund their business, while others decide they just do not have that time to spare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re simply concerned about the hassle and lengthy paperwork that a conventional loan could require, a faster fintech financing option might be what you’re seeking.</span></p>

It’s cheesy to say, but oh so true in the world of business. When you’re running a small business, having extra cash on hand can really come in handy. Whether you want some startup funding to get the ball rolling or need a little help to cover payroll while overcoming a temporary challenge, a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/small-business-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you get the job done. Let’s dive into how to get a small business loan, where to find one, and what your alternatives may look like. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to get a small business loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure where to start when looking for a small business loan for the first time, there are a few different paths you can pursue. Small business loans are often available at banks and credit unions, as well as online lenders or alternative lenders. Each one of these sources may have different offerings and requirements, so let’s take a look at what you can generally expect when dealing with each.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks and credit unions </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same financial institutions you do your personal banking at may have small business loans available. Of course, you can look outside your usual bank or credit union as well. However, if you’re in good standing with your bank regarding your personal accounts, that can work in your favor when applying for a small business loan. Both banks and credit unions tend to serve larger and more established businesses, but that doesn’t mean small businesses can’t fit into those categories. Especially, if the bank or credit union has loans backed by the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA)—these are known as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Loans backed by the SBA lower the risk for the lender, so it can make it easier for newer small businesses to take out a loan. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online and alternative lenders</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, you don’t have to stick to traditional financing methods. Online lenders and alternative lenders (like peer-to-peer lenders) can offer similar products as banks or credit unions, they just do so without offering in-person access to customers. If you prefer to do your banking in person, an online lender may not be the best fit. However, a lot of online lenders offer more flexibility than brick-and-mortar banks, which can be a good fit when starting a new business. There are also peer-to-peer small business lenders that can be found online where you can connect with investors looking to support small businesses. Peer-to-peer lending typically has less stringent criteria than when working with a big bank or credit union, but because the risk level can be high for lenders, you may have higher interest rates than you would find with a traditional business loan.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of small business loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few types of small business loans that may be available to you. Each has their own unique benefits and downsides, so you’ll need to think carefully about which type is best for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business line of credit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit works similarly to a credit card and you can use it to make purchases for your business such as stocking up on inventory or paying for ads. This form of credit comes with a maximum limit you can borrow and what’s helpful is that if you don’t borrow the full amount, you won’t pay interest on any money not borrowed. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business term loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum, as well as a fixed term and repayment amount. Payment will include both interest and principal payments. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice financing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some small businesses struggle with cash flow while waiting for invoices to be paid. If this is an area you struggle with, invoice financing (also known as factoring) can help by allowing you to sell your unpaid invoices to a lender at a discounted rate. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchant cash advance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A merchant cash advance provides borrowers with a lump sum that is based on their predicted future sales. This form of financing typically comes with high fees and may take a cut of your sales on a daily or weekly basis. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to apply for a small business loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The application process for a small business loan will vary a bit by lender, but generally you can expect to need to present the following supporting documentation during the application process. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information about your personal background</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resume</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income tax returns for the past two years or more</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation regarding any past and current business loans</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minimum of 12 months of your personal and business bank account statements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation that supports the cost and value of any personal or business property that you may want to use to secure the loan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your plan for how you intend to use the loan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debt schedule</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal documents such as: licenses, leases, articles of incorporation, and contracts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also likely that lenders may want to run a credit check during the application process. Your credit history and score can affect how easy it is for you to get a loan, as well as the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment terms you’re offered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a good chance your personal credit score will be evaluated, especially if you’re starting a new business, but if you have a business credit score, that may come into consideration as well. There is no one set minimum credit score that you must have to get a loan, but generally the better your credit score is, the better rates and terms you’ll be offered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a low credit score, getting a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-business-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be an easier path to take, as lenders will have your collateral to help lower their risk level. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatives to small business loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a small business loan does not feel like the right fit, entrepreneurs have a few other options at their disposal. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative online financing</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=g_s_tcpa_brand_search&amp;utm_term=%2Bfundbox&amp;utm_content=34351711000&amp;campaign_source=google&amp;campaignid=629220125&amp;targetid=kwd-310864995108&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;creative=477358285425&amp;placement=&amp;matchtype=b&amp;adpos=&amp;glcid=Cj0KCQiAmfmABhCHARIsACwPRAD8WfWxd2zTP5cYf6NavAKcuKUkp-qirjyD55PA3SkvWLM-g9dKSpMaAtX3EALw_wcB&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmfmABhCHARIsACwPRAD8WfWxd2zTP5cYf6NavAKcuKUkp-qirjyD55PA3SkvWLM-g9dKSpMaAtX3EALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides approved business owners with access to the capital they need to support their business, whether that be by purchasing equipment, paying bills, or overcoming cash flow gaps. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some business credit cards offer low interest rates or a 0% introductory rate which can provide small business owners with a low or no-interest loan of sorts. Many card issuers offer six months without interest. A business credit card is only a good financing option if you’re able to pay off your purchases before the introductory rate ends and a higher interest rate kicks in. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP Loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, there are some unique options available to small businesses looking for financing help in light of the coronavirus pandemic. One such option is a PPP Loan. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-whats-new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a loan provided by the SBA to help small business owners and non-profit enterprises keep their workers employed during this difficult time. Currently, you can apply for PPP Loan until May 31, 2021.</span></p>
