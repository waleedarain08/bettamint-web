<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There comes a time in the life of every small business when cash gets a little tight and decision makers look for outside sources of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these instances, many small business owners will hop on the chance to secure a loan. But not everyone looks forward to the process and time it takes to get approved for a traditional business loan—and that’s assuming you can get approved in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small business owners who seek timely financing to invest in their business and cover their operating expenses, invoice financing may be a much more sensible funding option.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between invoice financing and invoice factoring?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms “invoice financing” and “invoice factoring” are often used synonymously, though they’re not the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn about the differences between invoice factoring and invoice financing to see which one makes the most sense for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is invoice factoring?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring typically requires small businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to a third party at a hefty discount. Believe it or not, factoring companies have been known to take as much as 40 percent of the value of an invoice as their fee. More commonly, however, factors charge 10 to 15 percent on each invoice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, a factoring company will give you a slice of your unpaid invoice up front. Then they’ll repay the remainder of the invoice, minus their fee, when they collect payment from your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a key consideration here. When you decide to move forward with invoice factoring, your customers end up paying the factoring company, not your business. This can be slightly embarrassing to say the least. Making matters worse, this also opens the door to the possibility that your customer will have a negative experience dealing with the factor you decide to join forces with, which could hurt your chances at doing business with the customer again in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, some factoring companies might decide </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to buy your unpaid invoices if your clients have bad reputations or suboptimal credit scores. In order to move forward with invoice factoring, you need to be able to prove that your clients are good for their money and are generating consistent revenue on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth pointing out that invoice factoring companies are known to charge any number of additional fees—including origination and account setup fees, lockbox or service fees, incremental fees, unused line fees, monthly minimum volume fees, renewal fees, overdue or collection fees, credit check fees, non-recourse factoring fees, ACH transaction fees, and wire fees, among a myriad of other fees. These fees may not be disclosed clearly upfront and may require some digging to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add it all up, and it’s safe to say that you need to research your options and read the fine print before moving forward with invoice factoring. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does invoice financing work for a company?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonly mistaken as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, invoice financing allows you to borrow against your uncollected receivables. Instead of letting unpaid invoices collect dust and hinder your business, you can use an invoice financing service to advance payments on outstanding invoices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, it operates like an on-demand business cash advance against unpaid invoices. When you advance cash for unpaid invoices, you usually repay the advance, plus a small fee, within a certain time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With invoice financing, small businesses can get a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving credit line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against unpaid invoices without affecting their relationships with their clients. Rather than selling unpaid invoices to a factoring company and incurring the associated discount—and dealing with all the potential associated problems—invoice financing enables you to retain control over all of your invoices, only borrowing against the ones you choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being the case, invoice financing allows small business owners to reclaim control of their cash flow. Instead of scrambling to put together money to pay bills each month, they get the peace of mind that comes with knowing funds are only just a click of the mouse or tap of the finger away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to helping small business owners pay regular operating expenses, invoice financing services can also give companies enough padding to develop new products; launch new marketing initiatives; buy new equipment and technology; open additional locations; and remodel their storefronts, restaurants, and offices, among other things.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is invoice financing a good idea?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it really boils down to it, it’s impossible to say whether invoice financing is a good idea for your business or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company’s financial circumstances are unique, and different financing options will make more sense than others based on specific situations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, invoice financing tends to be a more affordable option than invoice factoring. It also gives you more control over your company’s image, since you can give your customers more time to pay instead of having to ask for payment immediately. And you’ll also end up collecting money directly from them whenever they settle their accounts instead of having a third party ask for money on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the invoice financing solution you choose, you should also be able to get paid much sooner than you would by using a factoring service. Due to a longer application process and the due diligence the factoring company needs to do, it tends to take a week or more to receive funds through factoring. On the flip side, you may be able to get paid within two or three days using invoice financing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much does invoice financing cost?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other financial instrument, invoice financing fees vary. Generally speaking, however, this is one of the more affordable forms of small business financing because you’re borrowing against what you’re already owed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you settle on invoice factoring or invoice financing, it’s worth exploring your other options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you may be able to overcome cash gaps simply by changing the way you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice your customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re waiting until the end of the month to send your clients a bill, consider testing out whether it makes sense to invoice them once work is complete. This could accelerate payment timelines considerably.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatives to invoice financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in securing fast, flexible financing quickly, you may also want to consider applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If approved, you can borrow against your line of credit and only pay interest on the money you’ve taken out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Fundbox account is fast and simple. There is no long approval process or piles of paperwork to fill out. To start, just provide some basic business details. Next, connect business accounts like your bank account and accounting software, such as QuickBooks Online or FreshBooks. If approved, you’ll see your available credit in your Fundbox dashboard. Select an amount to draw, and the funds will be in your bank account as soon as the next business day. </span></p>

What is not always so clear, however, is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you need to pay taxes </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much you currently owe. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions are often no easier when it comes to understanding how to charge your customer for taxes.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully this article can provide some clarity.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some taxing challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently millions of pages of legal tax law on the books, creating challenges for business owners of all stripes. Even those with relatively “simple” business models are often wondering whether they are paying their taxes correctly and on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common challenges faced by business owners is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not to </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-create-the-perfect-invoice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply taxes to an invoice</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoices often represent a significant portion of all financial transactions. When you issue one, does this create a tax obligation for the issuer? The recipient? Both? Neither?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the answer to this question is one that is highly situational. Whether you need to pay taxes on an invoice will depend on the legal status of both parties involved, the nature of the invoice itself, and a variety of other factors. Having accurate and correctly taxed invoices will help your business improve its reporting and payment cycles, along with other functions like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because applying taxes to an invoice can be difficult for some people, you may want to consider working with a professional accounting firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are wondering how to apply taxes to an invoice, you are certainly not alone. Below, we will discuss the most important things you need to know about applying a tax to an invoice. By taking the time to learn about this important process, you can put your business in a better financial position.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have to put tax on an invoice?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you need to pay taxes on an invoice will depend on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what the invoice represents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the invoice represents a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill of sale</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—and, as a result, is subject to sales tax—then yes, you will need to include taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first line of the invoice should include the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">total charges</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including all services and goods that have been rendered. Even if the goods and services have not yet been paid for (and thus qualify as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts receivable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), an invoice can still be used to show that a transaction has, in fact, occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next line on the invoice should include the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax amount</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Separating the taxed amount from the billed amount will be useful come tax season for both the invoice issuer and the invoice recipient. Any tax exemptions or adjustments should also be included. Be sure to include the applicable tax rate, whatever that might be. Most sales taxes are imposed on a state or local level, but other taxes and fees might also apply (and should be included in the invoice).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the invoice should also include any reductions, additions, or other types of changes. This might include a discount, a late fee, and various other types of adjustments. Ideally, your invoice will make it easy for a neutral (outside) party to determine when the transaction materialized and how much has been paid or will be paid in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different types of invoices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of invoices that might emerge over the course of doing business.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard Invoice: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the standard invoice is usually issued by a business to their client or customer. It should include the contact information for all parties, an invoice number, the corresponding tax information, and explain whether any money is still owed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a credit invoice is issued alongside any crediting transactions, such as a refund for a customer. The amount being credited will be listed as a negative value.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debit Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a debit invoice, also called a debit memo, can be used to make small adjustments to standard invoices. If any taxes are paid or applied, they should still be included.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timesheet Invoice:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a timesheet invoice can be used in instances when the individual is getting paid by the hour. This can include consultants, accountants, lawyers, and many other types of individuals. Unless the recipient is employed by the company, you can choose to let them handle the taxes on their own (they might need a 1099 or other tax form).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a transaction generates any sort of immediate tax obligation (anything other than year-end income tax), then the issuer should include all corresponding tax information.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to calculate tax on an invoice</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding how to apply tax to an invoice can help your business continue operating with ease. Here is how to calculate tax on an invoice:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step One: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">identify the type of transaction taking place. If the invoice represents the sale of goods or services, you will need to apply the sales tax.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Two:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> determine what the current applicable sales tax is. Your accountant should be able to easily answer this question, but if you are working on your own, be sure to check with all relevant jurisdictions your business is operating in.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Three:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> add the sales tax rate to 1 and multiply by the total sale (example below).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Four:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clearly list the added tax on the invoice, including the total tax, the new total, and the tax rate being used.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you are issuing an invoice for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">200, and the current tax rate is 7 percent. To determine the new total, simply multiply the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 by 1.07 (1 plus the tax rate). In this case, the new total would now be $214.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice tax best practices</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying attention to these common  practices may  help your business improve its current financial performance and, ultimately, improve its bottom line.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice Factoring</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring involves selling your outstanding invoices for a significant portion of the current cost. This helps you collect immediately on your invoices and access the cash you need for your business to grow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum Information: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a general rule of thumb, if you are wondering if you should include a piece of information (such as invoice tax) on the invoice, you probably should. It’s better to over-explain than to leave your clients wondering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about Timing: </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you send an invoice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will depend on the kind of invoice you are issuing. This might be after the purchase, after project completion, at specific milestones, or on a predetermined basis. Regardless, be sure that your invoice practices are predictable and clearly explained.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to apply tax to invoice can help your business improve its communication with clients, improve its reporting standards, and also make it much more likely you’ll be able to collect on existing accounts. As long as invoicing remains an important component of the business cycle, it will be important to find ways to enhance your current invoices and align them with industry standards.</span></p>

This can be a challenging game for companies to play if they need to get their hands on some cash fast. Giving your customers time to pay their bills can make their lives a whole lot easier and may be the only way they can afford to make purchases from you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s understandable why your customers may need to wait on their cash flow to pick up to pay their bills, your business may have the same need. Two potential solutions to cash flow problems caused by </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waiting for invoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be paid are bill discounting and invoice discounting. Let’s look at how these two processes vary, how much they cost, and the benefits and downsides of each solution. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is bill discounting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with bill discounting. Bill discounting offers a solution to unpaid invoices that are scheduled to be paid in the future. Essentially, the process of </span><a href="https://www.m1xchange.com/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entails selling unpaid invoices to a financier who will then pursue payment. When the company sells their unpaid invoices to a financier, they do so by offering them a discount. The point of doing this is to gain access to short-term financial assistance. This can be really helpful if your company is in need of working capital and wants to speed up your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at a bill discounting example. If Business A sold $100,000 worth of goods to Business B on credit, Business B will be issued an invoice they will have to pay at some point. If Business A is confident that Business B will pay their invoice but needs to access the cash from that sale sooner, they can sell that invoice to a company that provides bill discounting services. If Company A agrees to give a 15% discount to the bill discounting provider, they will be given $97,500. </span><a href="https://www.m1xchange.com/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much a company will have to pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> varies greatly depending on factors like the businesses’ financial history, the applicant’s credit score, and how stable the business is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While bill discounting will lead to earning less, which can be frustrating, if a business really needs cash to fund a business expenditure, order more inventory, or pay their employees, they may find bill discounting is worth the slight loss. These are a few of the benefits of bill discounting.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep cash flowing </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain fast access to cash in as little as 24 hours</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No collateral required</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill discounting is not a loan, and no debt is incurred</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet is not impacted as this is an off-the-book process</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is invoice discounting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up next is invoice discounting. It’s very easy to confuse bill discounting and invoice discounting since the terms sound so similar and help solve the same problem, but these are two very different processes. This is primarily because </span><a href="https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-invoice-discounting.html#:~:text=Invoice%20discounting%20is%20the%20practice,issued%20by%20a%20finance%20company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses unpaid invoices to act as collateral for a loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These loans are relatively short-term because the company can pay them back as soon as the invoice is paid. After going through invoice discounting, the company will receive a loan that is smaller than the amount of the outstanding invoices (usually 80% or any invoices that are less than 90 days old). Generally, the company financing the loan gives out loans based on the total percentage of invoices owed in order to spread out their liability. That way even if all the invoices aren’t paid, the company taking out the loan can still pay back their debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to bill discounting, invoice discounting provides a solution for companies looking to speed up their cash flow while they wait for their customers to pay their invoices. The company financing the invoice discounting generally charges interest on the loan and a monthly fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice discounting is typically a better fit for companies that have high profit margins that can help them cover the interest payments associated with invoice discounting. If a business has low profit margins, they may find this type of financing makes it hard for them to earn a profit. Typically, businesses pursue invoice discounting as a last resort because facing both interest payments and fees isn’t super appealing, and many only turn to invoice discounting if they can’t secure another form of financing.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice Factoring</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we compare and contrast the differences between bill discounting and invoice discounting, let’s take a quick look at what </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is as many businesses consider this financing solution when they need to gain access to cash flow quickly. Invoice factoring and invoice discounting are two different processes, despite their very similar names. Invoice factoring is a type of invoice financing that allows companies to sell their unpaid invoices to a factoring company. The factoring company then pursues payment directly from the customers who owe the business money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though both bill discounting and factoring provide similar short-term financing solutions,  bill discounting acts as an advance of sorts against a bill owed. Invoice factoring on the other hand, involves the outright purchase of trade debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may  lose quite a bit of cash when utilizing </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/business-financing-options/invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at a rate of about 60% to 95% of the total invoice value. Invoice factoring may be a better option for companies whose clients are overdue on their invoice payments and who don’t have time to track down late payments. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between bill and invoice discounting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure whether bill discounting or invoicing is a better fit for your business? Let’s take a look at how the two options compare.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both </span><a href="https://www.herofincorp.com/blog/what-bill-or-invoice-discounting#:~:text=Difference%20between%20Bill%20%26%20Invoice%20Discounting&amp;text=While%20invoice%20discounting%20is%20meant,30%20days%20to%20120%20days" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill discounting and invoice discounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serve a similar purpose for businesses. Each of these options give businesses a way to get their hands on the funds they’re waiting for after issuing invoices to their customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some key differences between these two financing options. Invoice discounting is a loan, whereas bill discounting acts as a bill of exchange. When you pursue invoice discounting, you can only do so for unpaid invoices that will be paid in 90 days, whereas bill discounting offers more flexibility and can work for bills due anywhere from 30 to 120 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what financing option a company pursues, they’ll want to make sure they shop around to see which financing companies can offer them the lowest interest rates and fees. This is an important step that can help save businesses a lot of money. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Fundbox Can Help</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both bill discounting and invoice discounting can provide solutions for business owners that need cash fast, neither of these options may be the best option for your business. If you’re looking for ongoing flexible financing options, a revolving line of credit may be a better fit for your business. A business line of credit can help businesses  cover more than just slow or late invoice payments and can step in when sales are slow or unplanned expenses arise. Having access to a business line of credit can make it easier to get through a rough patch—and can be what helps your business survive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you can pay back in equal installments over the course of a 12 or 24 week plan. You won’t face any penalties for repaying early and each time you make a payment, your available credit replenishes, giving you ongoing access to funds should you need them.</span></p>

That’s the question many small business owners struggle with as they’re growing their businesses. While invoicing and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting paid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are vital to a small company’s survival, your business also needs to get a handle on invoice processing for your accounts payable system. Late payments could mean losing key vendors and receiving a lower business credit score for a small business, making it harder to secure funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to take your accounts payable invoice processing by the reins? Here are several ways to start:</span></p>
<h2>1. Dictate the Invoice Processing Procedure</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with accounts receivables, your business is pretty much at the mercy of the clients or customers who pay you. You can request to be paid in a specific number of days and offer several payment methods, but when and how you get paid is ultimately out of your control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For accounts payable, in most cases, you can inform vendors about your accounts payable system and then negotiate from there. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Purchase Order</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Will your business need a purchase order before the project or sale is completed? For some industries, a purchase order is standard. But, even if your business doesn’t usually receive purchase orders, in some cases, it can be a beneficial first step in the sales relationship. A purchase order contains helpful information, such as a detailed description of the order, including quantity and unit price, as well as payment terms and delivery specifics. Purchase orders help make sales more transparent for the buyer and seller, so there is a smaller chance of misunderstandings later.</span></li>
<li><b>Method of Invoicing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How and when do you want to be invoiced? For example, do you prefer receiving invoices by mail or email or through an automated invoice processing program? Of course, the seller might have their own preferred way of invoicing, but, as the buyer, you can request invoices to suit your invoice processing.</span></li>
<li><b>The Details.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What information do you want included on the invoice? Depending on your purchases, you may want more detail on the product or services, such as color, weight, materials for products, and date of services completed. Do you want the name of the person receiving the bill printed right on the invoice? If there is a purchase order number, that should also be included for cross-reference.</span></li>
<li><b>Payment Terms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s essential to have the payment terms included on the invoice, including the due date, discount for early payments, and any potential late fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Streamline the Accounts Payable Process</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not your company is big enough to have an accounting department, the key to streamlining your accounts payable process is to have an official procedure and a system of checks and balances. Without either, you open up your business to costly mistakes, fraud, and possible embezzlement. Many businesses use the following accounts payable steps to streamline invoice processing.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Never have one person in charge of accounts payable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To avoid errors and fraud, it’s a good idea to have two or three people in charge of your AP reconciliations and payments.</span></li>
<li><b>Set up an approval system</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One person receives the invoices and checks them to make sure the information is complete and correct. If there’s a purchase order, it should be checked against the invoice. Then a different person should approve the invoice and schedule the payment. In most small businesses, the owner approves the invoice, and then it goes back to the original person for scheduling. If you have enough staff, consider putting one person in charge of final approvals before the payment goes out.</span></li>
<li><b>Get automated</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The easiest way to streamline your invoice processing is to use accounting software to automate most of the processes, eliminating errors due to messy handwriting or the transposition of numbers. Look for a program that’s not only user-friendly but also one with lots of customizable reporting features that can scale as your business grows. Once you get started, you’ll find going paperless makes it easier to stay organized.</span></li>
<li><b>Use the program features to their full extent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Accounting software systems offer a range of features, so it may take an extensive learning curve to become familiar with the system. However, it’s important to enter as much information as possible because it will save you time in the long run. For example, record as much information about the vendor as you can, including credit terms, due dates, W-9s for 1099s, etc.</span></li>
<li><b>Train your staff</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Being automated doesn’t eliminate human error, so your team should be thoroughly trained about using your invoicing program. Make sure you keep accounting information password protected and only give access to a few people.</span></li>
<li><b>Automate some monthly payments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you feel confident about your business’s monthly cash flow, consider automatically scheduling some regular vendor payments. Utility companies make it easy to autopay, but the information needs to be correctly entered into the system. You can cut out a lot of wasted tasks by automating some of your invoice processing.</span></li>
<li><b>Supervise accounts aging reports</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your accounting system keeps track of what is due when so you can see, at a glance, when you’ll need to have cash on hand to pay bills. If you know you have a big payable coming up, accounts aging reports help you maintain your budget and avoid bounced checks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Pay Your Invoices on Time</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Late or missing payments negatively affect your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than any other factor. Plus, once your credit score takes a hit, it’s not that easy to build it up again. Vendors may look at business credit scores before deciding to do business with you and neither the vendor nor the credit company has to tell you they requested your score. According to Experian </span><a href="https://www.businesscreditfacts.com/pdp.aspx?pg=faq-03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval is not needed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the business for someone to order their business credit report. This differs from personal credit reports which are regulated under permissible purposes only. Therefore, you may never know why your business didn’t get the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking advantage of early payment discounts, keeping your invoice processing system current, and ensuring you have adequate cash flow, you can avoid missed or late payments. On the other hand, every business owner gets caught short at some point in the life of a business, so it’s essential to have a backup plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many business owners turn to factoring (also known as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to temporarily increase cash flow. With </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you sell your unpaid invoices to the factoring company, and they collect payment directly from your customers and you will likely receive 60-95% of the invoice value, not the entire amount. But using Fundbox’s invoice financing system, if approved, you work directly with your customers and get the full value of the invoice (up to your credit limit) quickly deposited into your bank account. The repayment process is easy, and there’s no prepayment penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to stay on top of paying your bills is to have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ready to access whenever you’re short on cash. A line of credit is a preset amount of funds your business can access when you need it and pay it back later. Unlike a term loan (which has a fixed repayment), with some lenders you can pay back the line of credit in full or in payments without any early repayment fees. The best part of a line of credit is once you’ve paid back the borrowed amount, you have full access to the funds again without having to reapply for a loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers access to invoice financing, term loans, and lines of credit, all of which can help improve your business’s cash flow and make vendor payments on time. Cash flow is an integral part of streamlined invoice processing, so contact us today to get started.</span></p>

As you know, cash flow is crucial to a small business’s survival. Unfortunately, late payments have become far all too common, which puts many small businesses at risk. A</span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fundbox-study-reveals-crippling-effects-of-late-or-unpaid-invoices-300424576.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox survey</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed 64% of SMBs have dealt with  a past-due invoice which caused the following repercussions in their companies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% of small business owners couldn’t pay themselves</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23% couldn’t hire new employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23% were unable to invest in new equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% stopped their marketing efforts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18% delayed pay increases or bonuses for employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17% weren’t able to build their inventory</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the customer’s end, an outstanding payment is no picnic either. Late payments can lead to lower credit scores and the embarrassment of being hunted down for money or being turned over to collections.</span></p>
<h2>The Life of an Invoice</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoices are born in several different ways: They can get created before the project starts, or the transfer of goods occurs, or come at the end of the sale once the agreement is completed. In any case, the invoice notice informs the recipient of the amount of payment that’s due, when payment is due, and what forms of payment are accepted. It may also contain a purchase order number, a notice of early payment discount, and penalty fees for a past-due invoice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the invoice reaches the customer, it is usually either paid right away or entered into the customer’s system and then scheduled for payment. However, sometimes the unexpected occurs. There may be unforeseen circumstances that can delay payment, or your customer could have simply forgotten to pay. In these cases, the recommended  practice is to act immediately. You want to give customers the impression they need to make their payments on time. .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how do  you request payment from past-due invoices? Take a look at  these tips.</span></p>
<h2>Writing the Past-Due Invoice Letter</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll likely want to act soon after the payment is late. The definition of late depends on your industry’s accepted practices. You also should consider whether the customer repeatedly pays late or if this is a rare occurrence. Then you need to decide when to chase the unpaid invoice down and politely remind your customer about the unpaid invoice. That payment reminder usually starts with a past-due invoice letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fastest method to send a past-due invoice letter is by email, and that’s become an accepted practice by most customers today. Sending by email also allows you to attach a request receipt, so you’ll know when your customer has opened your email. Be aware the person you sent the message  to may have to approve the read receipt  before you’re notified. You can also send your past-due invoice letter via postal mail, but you’ll be left wondering whether the letter was ever received. Whichever way you send the reminder, make sure you record the date it was sent and schedule how soon you want to follow up. Invoicing programs allow you to automate sending reminders, so you don’t forget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the letter must contain all the pertinent information about the past-due invoice and payment details, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of the original invoice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice number, date of invoice, and the date you are sending the reminder</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details of the service provided or products purchased</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount owed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment terms, including late fees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment options</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contact person’s name, phone number, email, and hours the person can be reached</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the tone of the past-due invoice letter as you’re writing it. You may want to address a past-due invoice that’s a few days to a week late in a polite and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding tone. If the invoice is overdue, your language in the past-due invoice letter could  be more robust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between overdue and past-due pertains to time. A past-due invoice denotes the deadline for payment has recently passed, while overdue means an invoice payment is considerably late. An overdue invoice letter needs to convey urgency and relate the consequences if the payment remains in default. Hopefully, it won’t come to this. Still, if it does, think about turning the invoice over to a collection agency and let the customer know that’s one of your considerations if payment isn’t forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t feel comfortable creating this type of letter, search the internet for a past-due invoice email template to guide you through the process.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/invoicing/writing-overdue-invoice-letters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests using polite phrases when corresponding with your customers. Their research shows b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eing polite in your past-due invoice letters can actually</span> <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/invoice-payment-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help you get paid.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Invoices that included terms like “please pay your invoice within” and “thank you for your business” were 5% more likely to be paid. And, they add, you should make sure to include the words “please” and “thank you” in your letter even when the invoice is months overdue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also include links to payment options with the tagline: “for your convenience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month or more, it may be time to toughen your tone. Think about using phrases such as “Action Required” and “Urgent Matter.”</span></p>
<h2>The Phone Call</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company has sent three or more past-due invoice letters, then it may be time  to make a friendly phone call. Once you get someone on the phone, it becomes more difficult for them to avoid you </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would want to approach the phone call with a positive attitude and the assumption that the customer has either forgotten about payment or is too embarrassed to respond because they cannot pay you at this time. Your company will have a better chance of getting paid if you can come to an understanding, such as creating a payment schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be ready to accept payment over the telephone and have all the information you need on hand, so you don’t have to scramble. If the person is not ready to make payment at this time, try to find out what the hold-up is. Consider setting up a follow up call in a few days and let them know of any late fees you may charge . Late fees are typically determined by using an interest calculator, which calculates the cost based on the number of days the payment is late.</span></p>
<h2>The Final Push</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe payment is not forthcoming, you need to decide whether you want to send the past-due invoice to a collection agency and report the customer to the credit bureaus. If it’s gone this far, you’re likely to lose the customer for good, but you may not want to continue to do business with them anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, because late payments are common when running a small business, it’s crucial to have a backup plan, so your cash flow isn’t seriously disrupted. Securing a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ensures you’ll have cash on hand in case of serious shortfalls. A line of credit gives you access to the capital you need and the confidence to handle late payment challenges without breaking a sweat.</span></p>

As a small business owner, you now have more financing options than ever before—thanks to a number of creative web-based businesses offering new alternatives such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. Banks? They are just the beginning.</p>
<p>Here’s our updated guide to 10 business financing options you should know about as you seek funding for your small business.<br />
And for those who want to dive deeper, we’ve got you covered with links to our detailed and comprehensive guides to each type of business funding on our list.</p>
<h2>1. Bank loans and SBA Loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first type of business financing that usually comes to mind when you hear the term ‘small business loan’ is a traditional bank loan. Bank loans come in many forms (short-term, long-term) and can be used for a wide variety of purposes (working capital, expansion, equipment purchasing, commercial real estate). Sometimes these loans are secured with collateral; sometimes not. The most important things to know about small business bank loans? You are going to need to demonstrate stability (in the form of revenue, for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the best place to get a bank loan, well, that depends on your business needs—each bank has its own set of offerings and requirements. Regardless of where you go for a loan though, you are likely to encounter the option to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan. A popular subtype of bank loans, a large portion of each SBA loan is guaranteed by the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA, a government agency that provides information and resources to entrepreneurs to help them develop strong businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This SBA guarantee makes the idea of lending to small business owners more appealing to some banks, but the loans can be difficult to get because of the stringent requirements (in order to qualify for an SBA loan, you need to have a decent credit score, measurable cash flow and a solid business plan, among other qualifications). Despite that, SBA loans are attractive to many small business owners because they offer a lot of options and flexibility in terms of how the funds can be used. What’s more, the SBA also offers a variety of</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-entrepreneur-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">loan options for minority business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and those that operate in underserved markets.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Credit card financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to purchase equipment or materials for your small business, credit cards—or, in a crunch, credit card cash advances—are easily-accessible options that save you the trouble of applying for some other type of small business loan. Credit card financing, however, can be risky and you should strongly consider only using it  for short-term needs. If you go this route, consider paying off the card in time to avoid hefty finance charges and look for cards that offer cash back rewards or airline miles.</span></p>
<ul>

<h2>3. Business line of credit</h2>
<p>A business line of credit gives you access to a certain amount of capital to use as needed, typically based on your business&#8217;s cash flow and credit score (a business line of credit functions more like a credit card than <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a small business loan, but they are not one in the same</a>). You don’t have to tap into the line of credit until you actually need the funds, and you won’t accrue interest on funds you aren’t accessing either. Once you borrow from it, though, you will need to start making payments on the amount you used right away. As you pay back the actual funds borrowed, your line of credit will gradually replenish (meaning you once again have access to the money).</p>

</ul>
<h2>4. Equipment financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lending companies specialize in financing the purchase of business equipment. Another option? Ask the company you’re buying the equipment about financing—many offer their own financing programs.]</span></p>

<h2>5. Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)</h2>
<p>In this type of financing you get a lump sum advanced in anticipation of future credit card sales. Daily payments are made automatically by ACH transfer, and are typically based on a percentage of that day’s credit card transactions—so on a day when you make less, you pay less.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Invoice Factoring</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factoring is a system where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party ‘factoring’ company at a discount (typically, around 80 percent of the value of the invoices). The factoring company then takes over the job of collecting payment on those outstanding invoices from customers on your behalf (they return the 80 percent to you and keep the rest as their fee). Factoring can be helpful to small businesses that operate on a net 30 to net 90 payment system because it allows the businesses to get paid immediately rather than waiting until payment is officially due. The main downside to invoice factoring? You don’t receive your full payment. However, it can help alleviate cash flow concerns in some cases. </span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Invoice Financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the small business financing solutions we offer at Fundbox. Similar to factoring, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help improve your cash flow by allowing you to borrow against  your outstanding invoices so you don’t have to wait to get paid on a product you already delivered or a service you already provided. However, unlike factoring solutions, invoice financing through Fundbox can enable you to access 100 percent of your invoice value, up to your approved credit limit. Plus, you maintain your relationship with your customer.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Purchase order financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With purchase order financing, a lender provides the funds to buy inventory or materials to a small business that doesn’t have the cash on hand to fulfill a large order. After the order ships, the lender collects payment from the customer, subtracts fees and transfers the balance of the invoice back to the business at hand. Be aware that purchase order loans don’t apply to would-be orders—you need to have actual orders on the books in order to qualify.</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Peer-to-peer loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer-to-peer lending sites are online marketplaces where businesses and individuals can obtain loans from individual investors. The online marketplace manages the transaction, serving as a kind of escrow service, and takes a fee in return. This can be a good way to get a small, short-term loan if other methods haven’t worked.</span></p>
<h2><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cb904216-3670-4c9c-b75e-89e16cf2a74d_shutterstock_94343464.jpg" alt="" /></h2>
<h2>10. Crowdfunding</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variation of peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding sites allow businesses to pitch their ideas (often new inventions or products) and seek financing from interested individuals. The difference is that the money isn’t a loan, but a payment in return for something from your business, most often in the form of equity in your company to these early investors, or even something as simple as early access to your product or service. If your idea sparks the public’s interest, it’s possible (though not probable) to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars through crowdfunding. And even though it sounds like a long shot, it could be an option for some small businesses to consider because</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the crowdfunding market is expected to grow nearly $200 billion by 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside? If for some reason you are unable to deliver on your promise to your investors, they are going to be very disappointed.</span></p>

While frivolous expenses and big purchases are definitely on the chopping block, many businesses are also examining their receivables. They are considering </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and invoice financing to increase cash flow to their companies—sooner rather than later. What are accounts receivables, and how does factoring receivables help your cash flow? These are important questions, and there are finance factors to consider before deciding to take these financing routes. Here’s what to know.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Accounts Receivable Financing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also called “invoice financing,” accounts receivable financing advances your business money based on the value of your outstanding invoices. Accounts receivables count as assets, and their worth is equal to the invoices’ outstanding balances (customers that have been billed but have yet to pay). Like a business loan, the unpaid invoices are the collateral finance companies use to determine how much money to “lend” your company. The finance company will advance you up to 100% of an invoice’s (or invoices’) value and charge a fee based on the invoice’s value each week until the financed invoices are paid in full. Some finance companies also offer selective receivables financing. In this option, the borrower can choose which receivables to advance for early payment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although accounts receivable financing is sometimes confused with factoring, there are </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-invoice-financing-is-different-from-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important differences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The most significant difference is how the collection of the invoices is handled. With accounts receivable invoicing, you maintain ownership and control of your receivables. You still communicate with your customers and collect the payments. Your customers and clients will never know you have taken out a loan on their invoices. It may not seem like a big deal, but if your customers find out you sold their invoices to get cash, they may think your business is struggling, which could affect future business transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s essential to know the fees and length of the financing contract before you sign on with an accounts receivable financing company. </span><a href="https://help.fundbox.com/hc/en-us/articles/207260435-How-much-does-it-cost-to-use-Fundbox-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers accounts receivable financing at a reasonable rate of 4.66% for a 12-week repayment plan. There isn’t a minimum amount needed to be approved, and each week your payment to Fundbox includes the small fee. If you want to pay the contract off early, there are no penalties.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Factoring and How Does it Work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like accounts receivable financing, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advances your business money based on the amount of the outstanding invoices. However, with factoring, you sell your open invoices to the factoring company (a “factor”), and the factor collects payments for the invoices directly from your customers. Unlike accounts receivable financing, your company does not receive 100% of the invoice amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, with invoice factoring, the business receives approximately 80% of the invoice amount. After the factor collects the entire invoice amount, the company receives the remainder of the balance minus the factor’s fees. Fees for factoring can get pretty hefty and may include a percentage of the invoice value plus service fees, origination fees, credit check fees, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, because the factoring company now controls the collection of the unpaid invoices, they will notify your customers of the transaction and how to pay the invoice. The notice could alert your customers to your cash flow issues and potentially hurt your company’s reputation. On the other hand, you may want to give the responsibility of collection to another company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the factoring company now controls your invoices, you may find the factor has too much influence on what customers you are allowed to do business with in the future. If a customer defaults or is slow on a payment, the factor may terminate the relationship. Also, the factor may require a long-term contract with your business, which means giving up control of your invoices for longer than you desire. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Right Choice</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both accounts receivable financing and factoring are good alternatives to bank loans for small businesses needing a quick cash infusion that can’t wait for lengthy approvals. However, there are considerable differences between the two. Make sure you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of these types of financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If time is your biggest concern, factoring typically takes a bit longer than accounts receivable financing. Fundbox allows your business to choose how many invoices you want to finance. And depending on your bank, you may see the money in your business account in as little as one day.</span></p>

It&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated that $3.1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in receivables is owed to U.S. firms on any given day. The problem gets even worse when companies pay late. Improving cash flow is especially important during the COVID-19 economy. This need for quick cash has led many small businesses to consider invoice factoring — selling accounts receivable to an invoice factoring company at a discount, plus a fee. Besides being expensive, invoice factoring comes with other risks to your business. Here&#8217;s how factoring works, and how a line of credit may be a better alternative.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factoring is ancient history</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants and traders have been using a form of factoring since about 1754 B.C.E. (before the common era) in ancient Babylon, as </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hammurabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out in the Code of Hammurabi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a giant, black stone pillar detailing 282 rules governing commercial interactions, including establishing proper conduct, fines, and even eye-for-an-eye punishments. As early as 2000 years ago, Romans were believed to sell discounted promissory notes and hire third parties to settle their trade debts. </span></p>

<h6><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-13652" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg" alt="code of Hammurabi" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Code-of-Hammurabi-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><br />
<em>A closeup of the text of the Code of Hammurabi written in stone.</em></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring, as a practice by name, began in England before the year 1400. Pilgrims brought it to America around 1620. </span><a href="https://www.openbusinesscouncil.org/the-history-of-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">English common law required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if a merchant wanted to sell invoices to a third-party for factoring, the debtor had to be notified. However, that requirement had fallen away by 1949, when most state governments in the U.S. had adopted rules so that merchants could make factoring arrangements without notifying the debtor. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why businesses use factoring</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that factoring has been a common B2B practice for more than 3,700 years means that it has to be good for something, right? Basically, it&#8217;s a way for small businesses to get cash sooner instead of waiting around for their clients to pay on net terms, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay past due</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or not at all. It also frees a company&#8217;s staff from the stress and workload of following up on collections. Understandably, however, this convenience comes at a price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard and hidden costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring brings several disadvantages to the businesses who use it. It can be much more expensive than other types of funding — taking a large chunk out of your profits — and it may even face you with other issues.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The cost.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The discount rate (or factor rate), depending on the factoring period, could range from 2% to 10% of the invoice. Plus, you may have to pay service fees, origination fees, credit check fees, or other fees added by the factoring company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The customer impression.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies may issue a Notice of Assignment and verify your invoices with the debtor. If this happens, your customers may question the stability of your business, since turning to factoring is often a tell-tale sign of cash flow problems, so they may consider switching to your competitor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The contracts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies require long-term contracts, forcing you to sign over a majority of your invoices, rather than just filling a short-term cash crunch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The control over your business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reduce their risk from customers who are likely to default, some factoring companies may even prevent you from working with specific accounts you had previously built relationships with.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better way to maintain cash flow while waiting to get paid</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have more options than factoring to avoid the cash flow problems of delayed payments, even in situations where you can&#8217;t ask your customers to pay by credit card. A </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit from Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with the financial breathing room to keep your operations going despite the peaks and valleys of irregular working capital that may come even when facing irregular payment on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">receivables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Best of all, this comes without your business having to offer a discount on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment, sell your invoices at a loss, or sacrifice your control or reputation with your valuable customers. </span></p>

A customer whom you’ve offered the courtesy of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/welcome-new-net-terms-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trade credit in the form of net terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (like net 30 days) is late on their payments. They’re so late in fact, that it’s time to start considering your debt collection options. This can be the worst case scenario for both the business owner and the customer and is something both parties likely want to avoid. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dilemma can be especially troublesome for small businesses like manufacturers who depend on preserving their valuable relationships with their customers, such as sellers. Sometimes such partnerships go back many years, were difficult to obtain, and may even bear the additional weight of personal friendships. These emotional factors make the prospect of debt collection even more stressful and risky.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel you have no choice but to pursue debt collections, then you should arm yourself with the proper knowledge about the collections process. Debt collection is something to take very seriously. A misstep during this highly-regulated process can lead to your company incurring fees or legal penalties. Before you launch into this process, consider improving your collective knowledge about collections. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know the Laws</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, you should keep to the letter of the law during the debt collection process. Enter: the</span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/debt-collection-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FDCPA). Most famously, this act protects consumers from harassment from debt collectors. However, it does not technically apply its protections to business debt. Credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgage, medical bills, and other household debts receive protection from this act. Many businesses also choose to follow the general principles of the FDCPA if their customers fall into the small business or sole proprietor categories.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDCPA may not cover collection from the</span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/debt-collection-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> original creditor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who a consumer owes debt to. That being said, there are certain best practices associated with the FDCPA that may be worth following. Doing so can help maintain your business reputation and some goodwill with the debtor, such as not harassing the debtor day and night regarding the debt. It’s also worth reviewing your specific state’s regulations regarding debt collections to ensure you’re not breaking any laws. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beware of the Legal Risks of Collections</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to pursue collections, you can choose to outsource this task to a debt collection agency, which will cost you additional money. The FDCPA identifies collection agencies, debt buyers, and lawyers who specialize in debt collection as debt collectors. Another option would be to sell the debt, at a partial loss, to a company that purchases past-due debts and then works to collect them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business to business debt is generally known as commercial debt. While the FDCPA does not provide protections for commercial debt, the Commercial Collection Agency Association (CCAA) has regulations that commercial debt collection agents must abide by. To lower your risk of a debtor pursuing legal action, you may want to work with a debt collection agent who is a certified member of CCAA. Members have to abide by certain ethical standards which can provide peace of mind.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid Offering Terms to High Risk Customers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to protect your business from facing collection processes in the future is to be more conservative or smarter when offering net terms to customers, especially new ones. Understand that providing net terms essentially turns your Accounts Receivable department into a finance company. A first step of financing is to determine the creditworthiness of your customer. Doing so can involve processing credit applications, running credit checks, or acquiring financial information and references to perform due diligence. After approving an application, your team will need to negotiate and write a credit policy. All the while, you’ll be managing customer expectations and relationships.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider This Before Turning Outside</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find yourself in a position where your business needs to pursue debt collections, the costly option of hiring an outside collections agency or contractor may seem worthwhile. This may be especially true if your employees struggle to get the job done, waste valuable time and energy, and expose you to costly legal mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the costs involved, turning your past due accounts over to a third-party collections agency may perhaps affect the relationship you had established with some sensitive clients, due to the cold, practical nature of a collections representative compared to you, their known business partner. You may want to think twice before giving up the personal touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to resorting to collections, some businesses consider </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/factoring-right-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get paid for outstanding invoices immediately. With factoring, a third-party company will purchase your outstanding invoices for a percentage of their value (typically between 10 to 20 percent, or possibly more if the invoices are past due, plus any extra fees and charges). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, factoring has some serious downsides. You never get the full value of your invoices, your clients may be confused when contacted by a new company, and that may even cast into doubt the stability of your own business. </span></p>
<p>To help minimize the impact to your cash flow while waiting for customers to pay their invoices, consider turning to a <strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox line of credit</a></strong>, which can allow you to draw short-term liquid cash based on the anticipated revenue from outstanding invoices.</p>
