While </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for commercial janitorial services has spiked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> residential cleaning services have seen </span><a href="https://academy.getjobber.com/covid-19-impact-on-home-service-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revenues fall by 35%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to the same period in 2019 and 45% since the beginning of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a home cleaning business, it’s likely you’re feeling the pinch. With millions of us now working from home, concerns about infection risk have caused many Americans to suspend or cancel their cleaning services. A </span><a href="https://www.cmmonline.com/news/housekeepers-still-bearing-the-brunt-of-pandemic-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the National Domestic Workers Alliance found that 72% of residential housekeepers reported they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, sanitation and hygiene is more important than ever. Even leading epidemiologist, Dr. Fauci, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/how-fauci-5-other-health-specialists-deal-with-covid-19-risks-in-their-everyday-lives/2020/07/02/d4665ed6-b6fb-11ea-a510-55bf26485c93_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the only person who enters his house beside his wife and himself is his cleaning lady. In fact, cleaners are considered an essential service in many states and were exempt from lockdown orders. Yet as those orders have steadily lifted, residential cleaning companies still face an uphill struggle retaining existing clients and attracting new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a house cleaning business, now is a critical time to act. Here are some tips and strategies for growing your business during this unprecedented time (while protecting your employees and clients).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look after your employees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your employees are on the frontlines of efforts to help control the pandemic, yet many </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/domestic-workers-chartbook-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-demographics-wages-benefits-and-poverty-rates-of-the-professionals-who-care-for-our-family-members-and-clean-our-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic workers lack labor protections or healthcare coverage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can protect them should they get sick on the job. So, it’s important that every effort should be made to protect their health – and the health of your clients.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen employees regularly on their recent health conditions and provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. Emphasize that PPE should be discarded after each visit and fresh ones donned before cleaning the next home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although your cleaning protocols may not change much, train your cleaning teams on </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC reopening guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Position your services as “contactless”</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create policies and procedures that eliminate all contact between your cleaning crews and your customers. For example, you might establish policies whereby your clients are required to vacate the home or occupy a room that isn’t being cleaned while your team is on-site. If a client or their family can’t leave the home, request that they also wear masks and maintain a social distance of a minimum of six feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re quoting new business, use a video call or ask your prospects to send photos so you can provide a virtual estimate. When you schedule your visits, set defined appointment times so that your clients know when to expect you and can work around your visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to communicate these processes to your customers. Create a video or email to share and reassure families what your company is doing to keep everyone safe. Develop an FAQ that outlines the steps and precautions you are taking and share it on your website, blog, via email, and social media.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjust your marketing message</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a pandemic, your client’s priorities have changed and so should your messaging. Sanitation is more important than ever. To inspire customer confidence, stress the health benefits of a clean home and the measures you are taking to protect them during the cleaning process – the right disinfectants, PPE, contactless service, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the pandemic, our busy lives have made home cleaning services more of a necessity than a luxury. And now is no different. With entire families working and schooling from home, find ways to stress the emotional benefits of a clean home. Think Marie Kondo – a clean and organized home can destress and clear the mind – while keeping surfaces free from bacteria and viruses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/small-business-coronavirus-impact-poll-june#latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 80% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have pivoted from their usual service offerings. Consider your customer base and demographics and think of ways to boost your business now and for the future. Is there an opportunity to offer deep cleaning services using tools such as disinfectant foggers and ultraviolet light? Perhaps you could target clients with high-traffic homes such as vacation rentals or simply those who are hygiene conscious. Survey your existing client base to gauge interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How about partnering with a carpet or soft furnishing cleaning company and offer discounts for bundled services? Then give those clients an incentive to keep coming back with a discount off their first regular cleaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look to your community. Are there opportunities to expand into your services into commercial cleaning (without overextending your team) such as newly opened organizations such as churches or bars, restaurants, and retail stores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some other timely </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategies for pivoting your small business during coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply for a business line of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow is a challenge for small businesses at the best of times and especially difficult in 2020. As you look to sustain and rebuild your cleaning business, one way to have a reliable source of funding is to </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for a business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike term loans, credit decisions can be made quickly. With Fundbox, for example, credit decisions can be  made in minutes and funds may be transferred as soon as the next business day. </span></p>
<p><b>“Fundbox gives real money in our business account so I can make payroll while waiting for checks to come in. It’s been an amazing lifesaver.”</b><b><br />
</b><b>Kimberly Beckford, owner, OZGLO Cleaning Company</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funds can be used when needed—to meet payroll, purchase supplies and equipment, or to fund a marketing campaign. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you make your weekly payment, those funds are available to borrow—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no need to reapply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these other </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/financial-tips-for-uncertain-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tips for overcoming financial challenges in uncertain times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Janitorial businesses make a significant contribution to the U.S economy. <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> by IBIS World shows that the U.S. janitorial market amounts to more than 904,000+ businesses; 1,846,488 employees; and annual revenues of $53 billion, and that&#8217;s expected to dramatically increase in 2020.</p>
<p>While growth in this sector was only moderate at 1.6% annually, the <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demand for cleaning businesses</a> has exploded since the outbreak of COVID-19. Here are ten tips for getting a share of that pie and grow your janitorial business.</p>
<h2><strong>10 Ways to Grow Your Janitorial Business</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Start by Looking at Your Current Customer Base</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to grow your janitorial business, your current customer base can tell you a great deal about why your business is a success, where it needs to grow, and what goals and tactics you should spend your time on. This little bit of research is an essential first step to growth that will help you repeat your wins rather than adopt a scatter-gun approach to growth.</p>
<p>Think about where your current customers come from. What were the lead sources? Was it from referrals, word of mouth, advertisements? Which tactic worked best? Is it a model you can repeat?</p>
<h3><strong>2. Know What Your Customer is Looking For</strong></h3>
<p>Take your customer research to the next level by building a picture of their needs. Never assume that your growth plans align with what your customers want or you risk going after a market opportunity that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Get feedback from current and even prospective customers to see what they look for when selecting and retaining a janitorial service. It&#8217;s never always just about price. It could be reliability, quality of work, flexible schedules, employee conduct, and so on. The industry is increasingly moving towards green cleaning services (which IBIS states as a key opportunity for janitorial businesses)—is there a need in your market?</p>
<p>Then consider how your competition stacks up against these needs. How do they compare to your business? Is there a gap you can fill?</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stop and Think About Your Business Vision</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been in business for a while, there&#8217;s a good chance that the day to day &#8220;busyness&#8221; of running a business has taken your eye off your wider goals. As you think about growing your business, reflect on what you want that business to look like.</p>
<p>Do you want to take on larger clients? Or, perhaps, expand into other sites, campuses, or locations that your existing clients have? (This is low hanging fruit and could be a win-win if you can add some sort of incentive, such as a discount). Determine the types of businesses you want to go into.</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps you might see more success in diversifying your offerings? For example, could you add window cleaning or HVAC maintenance to your services? Your vision will help steer your growth strategies.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Plan Your Marketing in Chunks</strong></h3>
<p>When did you last see any marketing or branding excitement from a janitorial business? Not that often, right? Once you have a vision and a strategy, think about your marketing plan. This will give you a path to follow that can help you grow your janitorial business.</p>
<p>Your plan should be informed by your goals and your research, and it is best approached in chunks. If you are trying to reach customers who don&#8217;t know about your business, you&#8217;ll need some awareness tactics in there (advertising, PR, etc.). You&#8217;ll also need a plan for once they are engaged (i.e. they want to learn more about you)—this could include case studies, customer references, a short YouTube video explaining your core values and service offerings, etc. Finally, find a way to keep marketing through your happy customers using a referral program. For more tips, check out these tips from my fellow blogger, Rieva Lesonsky: Creating a Marketing Action Plan.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Create a Target Customer List</strong></h3>
<p>As you think about your marketing tactics, refer again to your vision. What defines growth for you? Are you hoping to expand your service delivery radius? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, auto dealerships, malls, corporate offices, etc.). This will help you determine who to target in your marketing.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Good Old Direct Mail Still Works</strong></h3>
<p>If you intend to run a direct mail campaign (always a good idea if you&#8217;re trying to reach a specific person), create a short list of target companies within your service area. Find out who the facility manager is and build a spreadsheet of all your target contacts. Plan around your budget, but be prepared to send 3–5 mail pieces and stagger your messages. Start by introducing yourself and your company, then send a brochure, follow it with a piece that links to success stories on your website, include a small giveaway like a fridge magnet with your contact info, then ask for a meeting, perhaps offer a free trial—think of it as a drip effect.</p>
<p>Keep at it. If you didn&#8217;t have much success, &#8220;rinse and repeat&#8221;. Come up with new marketing pieces, consider tweaking your message, and start the cycle again six months later.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Knock on Doors</strong></h3>
<p>Door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services, an industry which, as I mentioned earlier, often flies under the radar of traditional, big-splash marketing campaigns. Refer to your target contact list, perfect your pitch, and create a special offer to lock them in.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Get Out in the Community</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to grow your business, be more active in the community in order to build brand recognition. Find ways to participate at town fairs, festivals, and chamber of commerce and networking events. You might even consider sponsoring a fun run or charity event.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Have a Consistent, Defining Message</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, perhaps one of the most important things in marketing is having a consistent marketing message. You can&#8217;t be all things to all people, so carefully consider your differentiators and your target market as well was what you&#8217;ve already successfully done for other companies as you craft your message. Back it up with a story—explain what led you into this line of business, expand on why you&#8217;re different, and how this permeates your mission and what you do. The story is a useful starting point to crafting your sales and elevator pitch, website messaging, advertising, and other marketing tactics (brochures, flyers, social media) that you use to build awareness.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Get Quick Funds with a Line of Credit</strong></h3>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup">business line of credit</a> </strong>can help you with payroll, supplies, and overhead expenses while you&#8217;re waiting to get paid. It can also arm you with the short-term capital you need to grow. You can use these funds to launch a marketing plan, hire new employees, expand or open a new location, or many of the other growth tactics mentioned above.</p>

Most state governments across the country are asking consumers to stay-at-home and nonessential businesses to close their doors to in-store customers. As the list of stores deemed essential grows narrower every day and the virus continues to spread, businesses should have a contingency plan in place. Retailers face challenges on two fronts: how will supply chains be interrupted and how to still get product to customers? </span></p>
<h3><b>Supply Chain Disruption</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to current news sources, while </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-open-for-business-but-the-post-coronavirus-reboot-looks-slow-and-rocky-11585232600"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is slowly climbing out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from under its manufacturing interruption, the rest of the world’s suppliers are just feeling the impact of the lockdown. </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/truckers-facing-coronavirus-hurdles-in-keeping-supply-chains-moving-11584564327"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freight carriers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are under restrictions when it comes to delivering goods. Government border lockdowns are continuing to delay deliveries and impeding businesses across the country from getting goods to customers in a timely manner. As more airlines cut flights, the transportation of goods is backing up quickly and what would normally move in a few days is taking much longer to get across borders. A shortage of truck drivers and consumers’ panicked stockpiling has led to added stress on suppliers and shortages of goods making them more expensive for wholesalers, retailers and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the disruption is already starting to impact the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-wreaks-havoc-on-retail-supply-chains-globally.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shipment of goods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to retailers for the back-to-school season, </span><a href="https://nrf.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Retail Federation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NRF) president and CEO Matthew Shay sees the supply chain disruption subsiding with the main issue becoming getting merchandise into the hands of retailers and subsequently the consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, small business owners are feeling the strain and turning to local suppliers to keep inventory in stock. When Adam Rizza, cofounder of </span><a href="https://www.isunscape.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunscape Eyewear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an eyewear  wholesaler and online retailer, quickly discovered the orders from his Chinese factories were  going to be delayed an additional 45 days, he found local sources for his products so he could ship to his clients. “We had to source goods from larger local distributors; however, this affected our margins.” Plus, Rizza had to send his staff home (due to California’s stay-at-home policies), and still make payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your foreign sources are delayed, you can contact your city/county business development offices for a list of local businesses who have the product you need. Or you can also source from website marketplaces such as </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/oberlo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.amazonbusiness.com/TryAB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.alibaba.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alibaba</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (just be sure to check availability and delivery estimates).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about payment and credit terms under these unusual circumstances, you may find vendors are in the same boat and willing to make deals and allowances right now. While you’re waiting for business as usual to return, you can search now for financial companies that offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-business-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a line of credit or allow flexible terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small business loans.</span></p>
<h3><b>Keep Customers Safe and Spending</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although your business may be in a </span><a href="https://nrf.com/resources/retail-safety-and-security-tools/coronavirus-resources-retailers/state-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not yet in lockdown, convincing customers it’s safe to shop in your store is a retail challenge you’ve likely never faced before. The </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CDC) recommends developing a comprehensive strategy to decrease the spread of the coronavirus and lower the impact in your workplace. This involves reducing transmission among employees, maintaining healthy business operations, and maintaining a healthy work environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information comes out every day about how to identify the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the coronavirus. It’s vital you keep your employees informed about these so they don’t come into work with the slightest sign of sickness. You may even want to require employees to take their temperature daily before showing up to work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep the workplace clean, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommends cleaning with soap and water first and then disinfecting with diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70 percent alcohol. The </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EPA) has also issued a list of disinfectants for use against SARS-CoV-2, </span><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cause of COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Cleaning staff should also wear disposable gloves and coveralls for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash. If you know someone in your store has tested positive, the CDC recommends immediately sealing off the area for 24 hours (if possible) to “minimize potential for exposure to respiratory droplets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you complete these best practices for safety, be sure to share your processes with your customers so they can feel safe and assured you’re doing everything you can to make shopping safer. Post updates across your social media channels, on your website, in email updates and even on the windows and doors of your store. Even if you decide to close your doors and only offer online shopping, knowing your products are coming from a safe environment can go a long way soothing virus-anxious consumers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Focus on Online Sales</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your retail business has not yet set up an e-commerce component or you’ve simply let that portion of your business skate for a while, now can be a good time to ramp up your online sales. According to </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chain Store Age</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, becoming a digital retailer “quickly” is entirely possible. There are several ways to make it happen.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Third-party delivery services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re not yet set up for delivering online orders, there are many third-party providers that handle part or all of the process. Do a quick search in your area and check out nationwide services such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliv.co</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.roadie.com/small-business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>E-commerce platforms/marketplaces</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s also fairly easy to set up an e-commerce store on marketplaces such as eBay, Shopify and BigCommerce. Right now, demand is high on marketplaces such as Amazon, so know deliveries will be slower than normal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One idea you may not have thought of is turning your store into a digital commerce hub. If you close your store for regular commercial shopping, you can still help consumers get products by contacting package delivery services such as FedEx and making your store a distribution point for consumers receiving products. You can also partner with Amazon to become an </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13853235011"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a Hub you can either house Amazon lockers which allows customers to self-service for pickup/returns or provide a counter and staff the kiosk to handle pickups and returns. In the long run you may attract new customers who may not have known about your business before they walked into your store to get their packages. </span></p>

In an industry that from 2014 through 2019 enjoyed only </span><a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/janitorial-services-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moderate growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 1.7% annually,</span><b> coronavirus is now causing a 75% spike</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taking-it-to-the-cleaners-coronavirus-spurs-spike-in-demand-for-jobs-to-sanitize-america-2020-03-12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new job openings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March compared to a year earlier, according to online jobs marketplace ZipRecruiter.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This demand is especially true for commercial office spaces—a challenge compounded by shelter-in-place mandates or work-from-home company policies in a growing number of American cities. Eventually, those workers will have to return, perhaps as soon as early April, 2020, with the expectation that their offices are safe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, thousands of retailers across the U.S. are seeking cleaning services to disinfect their stores and help lessen customers&#8217; fears. Since the outbreak, ServiceChannel reports </span><a href="https://chainstoreage.com/janitorial-services-stores-rise-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dramatic increases in requests for facilities services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by retailers so far in 2020, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Luxury retailers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 84% increase in janitorial cleaning and carpet shampooing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Big-box retailers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 35% increase in HVAC air filter cleanings and janitorial services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Grocery stores</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 18% increase in janitorial cleaning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Restaurants</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 53% average increase in cleaning, primarily in janitorial and kitchen</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add to this the sudden and huge demand in janitorial work orders at </span><b>healthcare-related offices  (up 66%)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not to mention the upcoming unmeasurably-high need for residential cleaning services.</span></p>
<h2>A mission to serve, not just to grow</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you own a janitorial, cleaning services, or facilities management company, this is a critical time to act. Beyond the obvious and unprecedented </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-your-janitorial-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity for growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you&#8217;re on the front lines to help control a global pandemic. How is your business prepared to meet this demand—and its many challenges—right now? Here is a list of key steps and things to consider regarding the current and future services you provide.</span></p>
<h2>1. Hire the right people</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even under the best circumstances, </span><a href="https://www.janitorialmanager.com/blog/hire-to-hire-janitorial-employees-rock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruiting quality janitorial employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be one of the toughest aspects of your business. Unemployment in the cleaning industry is already at a </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taking-it-to-the-cleaners-coronavirus-spurs-spike-in-demand-for-jobs-to-sanitize-america-2020-03-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record low of 2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the candidate pool isn&#8217;t very large, according to Indeed Hiring Lab. Plus, these  require more skill and may even involve technician licensing requirements. Here are some tips to help improve and speed your hiring process:<br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mobile-friendly job listings.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> First, you should post easy-to-find openings on your website, which should ideally be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimized for mobile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, since about 90% of people use smartphones to search. Google&#8217;s indexing algorithm penalizes websites that aren&#8217;t mobile-friendly, making them appear much lower in search results. Plus, </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/mobile-job-search/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that mobile-friendly can increase the number of job applicants by 11.6% compared to job listings that aren&#8217;t from other employers that aren’t mobile-friendly.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Simplified job applications. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Glassdoor, &#8220;Lower-income workers complete job applications at lower rates and take longer to complete each application.&#8221; Using a mobile device makes this even worse, so asking them to self-describe their skills and education on an online form could deter many applicants. You may want to consider providing the option of simply attaching a resume.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Posting to job sites. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many popular websites like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, JobVite.com, LinkedIn.com, and Craigslist. However, many such sites require employers to pay fees as high as $999 per month.</span></span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cleaning associations. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also try posting jobs on any cleaning associations you&#8217;re a member of (or consider joining), such as:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.issa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ISSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The Worldwide Cleaning Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.ijcsa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IJCSA </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(International Janitorial Cleaning Services Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.icrassociation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (International Cleaning and Restoration Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.nca-i.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (National Cleaners Association)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bscai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BSCAI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Building Service Contractors Association International)</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer incentives. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With competition high and applicant numbers low, you may find it helpful to stand out by offering incentives to attract quality people. For example, you could advertise competitive wages, signing bonuses, or longer vacation allowances. Some businesses also offer current employees referral bonuses.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Purchase the best possible equipment and supplies</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combatting something as deadly serious as coronavirus demands not scrimping on the quality of the tools you use—from disinfectants to application devices to personal protective gear for your employees. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use only </b><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>CDC approved or recommended procedures</b></a><b> and </b><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>EPA registered hospital-grade disinfectants</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that kill bacteria and inactivate viruses.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Strictly follow </b><a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/standards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>current published OSHA standards</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for how infected materials are cleaned, disinfected, and properly disposed of as biohazard waste.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide OSHA-approved, </b><a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/personalprotectiveequipment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>fully encapsulated personal protective equipment (PPE)</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and full-face respirator masks, to be worn at all times by your certified cleanup technicians.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Develop and follow strict </b><a href="https://www.emergency-response-planning.com/blog/bid/74836/An-Expert-Guide-to-Demobilization-and-Post-Incident-Recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>demobilization processes</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your equipment, trucks and waste storage areas.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consider high-tech equipment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some cleaning services have found it effective and time-saving to use such technologies as </span><a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2020/03/15/coronavirus-springfield-covid-19-fear-cleaners-high-demand/5036211002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrostatic sprayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to coat surfaces with disinfectant or even </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRXZjLk_4Hk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-powered ultraviolet light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to kill bacteria and viruses on hard-to reach areas. But of course, always follow recommended CDC and EPA guidelines.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every cleaning is different in its details,&#8221; says </span><a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/property-management/cleaning-commercial-properties-to-fight-covid-19-this-is-no-time-to-cheap-out-103420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Biorisk Advisory Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of Forensic Operations, Jeff Jones. &#8220;But the essential process depends on three factors: the chemicals applied to the surfaces, the equipment used to apply them and whether personnel are properly trained to follow CDC guidelines.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>3. Start marketing your services</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at times of high demand, such as after natural disasters or during the coronavirus crisis, marketing is essential to your business success. Develop a marketing plan and invest in producing the materials you need to inform and be seen by the clients who require your help and to stand out from the competitors in your area—especially those who may be cheaper and/or less reputable than your own company. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Have a plan. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing plan doesn&#8217;t need to be extensive. However, such a plan can help focus your thoughts, efforts, and budget to help get the maximum results with minimum waste. Here is a quick guide on </span><a href="https://www.smallbizdaily.com/how-to-write-a-marketing-plan-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to write a marketing plan for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Know what makes you different.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Carefully consider your differentiators and your target market. Do you have expertise cleaning particular kinds of job sites, such as healthcare facilities, schools, factories, or residences? Craft your company mission statement and &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; that&#8217;s clear, powerful, and consistent across your website messaging, advertising, and other marketing assets (brochures, flyers, social media).</span></span></li>
<li><b>Create a target list. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know what geographic areas you can best serve? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, retail shops, restaurants, corporate offices, etc.)? Determining this ahead of time will help you better target your marketing and save money.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Get out into the community.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are many traditional ways to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-brand-cleaning-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build brand recognition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and raise awareness of your essential services. Consider new signage for your building or your service vehicles. Out-of-home advertising (such as billboards or bus shelter ads) can also promote your business on an automatic and ongoing basis. Consider radio or TV advertising to reach a larger audience. You may want to participate in business fairs and local chamber of commerce and networking events. Finally, door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Help with the cash flow you need to help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the ramp up to preparing to meet such a demand for essential services can sometimes challenge your available cash on hand. If you’re an established janitorial or cleaning services business, Fundbox may be able to help, with a <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Amazon, Warby Parker, Casper, and many other well-known brands that began exclusively online have transitioned to selling their products in real-world storefronts. You may be thinking about doing the same with your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>Interested in opening a physical store, but not sure how to get started? In this guide, we&#8217;ll show you how to get started with expanding your e-commerce store to physical retail.</p>
<h2>Why online retailers expand to brick and mortar stores</h2>
<p>Wondering if you should expand to a brick and mortar location? There are many reasons why you might want a physical store.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at why some well-known brands have been shifting their merchandise into traditional street-side businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Report/Worldwide-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-eMarketers-Estimates-20162021/2002090">eMarketer</a>, a research provider, shows only 10.1 percent of retail revenue in the U.S. is generated via e-commerce. The rest is generated in-store and offline.</li>
<li><a href="https://brizfeel.com/consumer-online-retail-shopping-behavior/">BrizFeel</a>, a water purification maker, surveyed 30,000 consumers aged 18 &#8211; 65 and found that 51 percent said not being able to touch, feel, or try a product was the biggest drawback of online shopping.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/slickdeals-shares-new-survey-data-showing-americans-spend-324000-on-impulse-buys-in-their-lifetime-300601768.html">Slickdeals</a>, a consumer deal-sharing platform, surveyed 2,000 U.S. consumers and found they spend an average of $5,400 annually on impulse buys in stores and at restaurants.</li>
<li><a href="http://possible.mindtree.com/rs/574-LHH-431/images/Mindtree%20Shopper%20Survey%20Report.pdf">Mindtree</a>, a global technology consulting company, surveyed 600 shoppers in the U.S. and found that when a sales associate assisted in-store, 43 percent were more likely to purchase a product and the transactions had 81 percent more value.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, consumers still enjoy purchasing products in brick and mortar stores. Whether it is for the experience or for the satisfaction of getting what they want immediately without paying for shipping, the answer is clear: brick and mortar is still a solid option for anyone who wants to make sales.</p>
<h2>How to open a brick and mortar store</h2>
<p>While the thought of opening your first retail store may be daunting, it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Here are some easy steps to get you started on your journey to turning your online store into an incredible offline retail experience.</p>
<h3>1. Find the best location for your retail store.</h3>
<p>Choosing the right location for your first store in the real world is crucial to the success of your business expansion. You want to choose a location that’s convenient for your ideal customer. Where do they live, work, and prefer to shop? Bring your store to them.</p>
<p>For example, if you sell luxury fashion online, you may want to lease a storefront in a high-end mall or outdoor shopping center. To help choose the right locations, you can use <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/73784">location analysis tools</a> and work with research firms to uncover insights into market demographics including the area&#8217;s average household income and age range, as well as traffic patterns and lifestyle data.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can do additional research by looking at surrounding retail stores and restaurants in the areas you are considering. Their clientele and popularity will give you an idea of who you can expect to walk into your business and how popular you can expect it to be.</p>
<h3>2. Know what will be in your lease and what you can negotiate.</h3>
<p>Once you find a few locations that may be perfect for your brick and mortar, you will need to figure out what will work for your leasing terms and budget. You may be able to negotiate a better rate based on how long you plan on staying in a particular location (generally, the longer the lease, the better the deal).</p>
<p>You will also want to get the details on what else is included with your lease payment and what you will be expected to pay for on your own. These expenses may include property taxes, insurance, maintenance of your space, common area maintenance, security, and basic utilities.</p>
<h3>3. Get your permits and licenses.</h3>
<p>Before you can start doing business in a retail store, you will need to get any city, state, and federal permits and licenses required in your area. These will vary based on the products and the services you plan to sell.</p>
<p>New York City, for example, offers a two-page <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycbe/downloads/pdf/nycstarter_guide_retail_store.pdf">retail store starter guide</a> and <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/wizard">step by step wizard</a>. Together, business owners can find the exact documents they need to get together before they have their store&#8217;s grand opening.</p>
<p>Research carefully to make sure you have your legal requirements covered in plenty of time.</p>
<h3>4. Decide on the merchandising and sales equipment.</h3>
<p>Your physical store environment should offer a great experience for your customers. Think about how you can give visitors the chance to touch and feel your products in a unique space that expresses your brand. You’ll probably also want to give customers the chance to get your most popular products and take them home the same day.</p>
<p>With these things in mind, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much merchandise and inventory do you want on hand for your grand opening?</li>
<li>How many clothing racks, counter displays, display tables, promotional displays, showcases, shelves, signage, slat walls, wall racks, and warehouse storage will you need for your merchandise?</li>
<li>How many POS systems do you plan to have to keep sales moving smoothly?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to your merchandising and sales equipment, you will need a system to manage your inventory and sales. If your e-commerce store uses a platform like Shopify, you can use it to manage your physical store&#8217;s point of sale hardware and inventory management.</p>
<h3>5. Consider how many people you will need to hire to run your store.</h3>
<p>Retailers that under-staff their stores can miss out on sales, according to insights provided by <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/retailers-are-understaffing-stores-and-losing-sales/513055/">RetailDive</a>. The last thing you want when creating a new in-store experience is for your customers to feel ignored because they can’t get the attention of a sales associate when they need one.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure how many people to hire for your brick and mortar store, conduct some research. Take a few trips to similar businesses in the area where you plan to set up shop. Visit during off-hours (like weekday mornings) and peak hours (like Saturday afternoons) to see how many people work on the sales floor and at the registers.</p>
<h3>6. Write your business plan to prepare to apply for funding.</h3>
<p>After you have done the research on your brick and mortar&#8217;s leasing options, permits and licenses, merchandising and inventory, and hiring expenses, you should have a solid idea of the amount of <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/us/resources/business-financing/">business financing</a> you will need to make your brick and mortar store dream a reality. At this point, you are ready to write a business plan to show potential lenders how you plan to put their money to use.</p>
<p>Read our free <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to business financing</a> and learn about your options.</p>
<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a free guide on <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan">how to write a business plan</a>. You can also find great examples of retail store plans at <a href="https://www.bplans.com/retail_and_online_store_business_plan_templates.php">Bplans</a> for retailers of everything from art supplies to women&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>The goal of your business plan is to describe (in detail) your company, ideal customers, market viability, products and services, marketing and sales strategy, funding requirements, and financial projections. Your business plan will tell lenders <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/todays-retailers-can-compete-giants/">what makes your business stand out from the competition</a> and how you will use the funds to achieve specific objectives.</p>
<h2>A final word</h2>
<p>Opening a brick and mortar is just one possible avenue for growth, and it’s important to take the time to compare which investment opportunity will have the biggest impact on your bottom line. While having a physical storefront isn’t right for every business, there are a ton of potential benefits that could make the endeavor worthwhile for you.</p>

In this guest post from Lendio, a look at the pros and cons.</h3>
<p>Credit cards are more widespread than ever, mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are growing, and entire countries—such as Sweden, which aims to become a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/11/691334123/swedens-cashless-experiment-is-it-too-much-too-fast">cashless society</a>—are embracing plastic and trying to rid the world of paper money. But in the United States, where the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/">FDIC reports</a> that 8.4 million households are unbanked and another 24 million are underbanked, the cashless revolution might not be so near.</p>
<p>While cash use is declining in the US, more than 70 percent of Americans still make purchases in cash every week, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/12/more-americans-are-making-no-weekly-purchases-with-cash/">Pew Research Center</a> reports. Of course, that leaves a third of the population for whom cash is no longer necessary, and that number is likely growing. Given this trend toward plastic and digital, it can be tempting to adjust your business accordingly.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benefits to doing away with cash altogether, but is it the right choice for your retail business?</p>
<h2>The Cashless Business Trend Sweeps US Cities</h2>
<p>Several hip eateries catering toward younger crowds in major US cities have <a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/2/15/16974980/cashless-restaurants-credit-card-only-legal-problem-discriminatory">already gone cashless</a>, including popular dessert chain Milk Bar and Chicago-based Epic Burger. Amazon recently introduced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a>, a cashless-by-design chain of grab-and-go supermarkets where you can avoid the checkout process entirely by charging anything you place in your shopping cart to your Amazon account.</p>
<p>While businesses can fall on both sides of the cashless debate, one clear winner is propelling the movement: credit card companies, which stand to make anywhere from 1 percent to 4 percent each time a customer swipes plastic. Visa launched a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/visa/2018/visa-cashless-challenge-smbs-pos/">Cashless Challenge</a> in 2017 that awarded 50 businesses with $10,000 for making the switch to being cashless.</p>
<h2>Pros of Going Cashless for Small Businesses</h2>
<p>Chains aren’t the only businesses moving to cashless systems. Even small businesses stand to benefit in some key ways.</p>
<h3>1. Save time and money</h3>
<p>While businesses have to pay a fee for each credit card transaction, they also have to pay an employee for the additional time it takes to accept cash. From counting the cash at the end of the day to making frequent trips to the bank and possibly paying deposit fees, these extra hours add up. When Sweetgreen, a salad chain, originally went cashless, they <a href="https://medium.com/sweetgreen/cashless-49f64f24dd0f">released a statement</a> explaining that a large part of the decision came from the desire to scale up and the fact that they spent about two hours every day on cash management in each store.</p>
<h3>2. Increase checkout efficiency</h3>
<p>One swipe or tap of a credit card makes for a much faster transaction than the process of counting cash and giving change. For businesses that experience long lines during peak times, going cash-free can significantly speed up the checkout process and curb those lines, making customers more likely to stop in and make a purchase.</p>
<h3>3. Decrease risk</h3>
<p>Keeping cash in the register leaves your business at risk for theft and robbery. One Baltimore-based cafe went cashless in 2017 after facing five armed robberies in just four months. What’s more, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/workplace-crime-costs-us-businesses-50-billion-a-year.html">Statistic Brain and CNBC report</a> that employee theft costs US businesses $50 billion each year. By not accepting cash, you’re also making it impossible for employees to skim your profits from the register.</p>
<h3>4. Improve accounting</h3>
<p>Imagine never having to go through the books again to figure out why the register is coming up short at the end of the day. Going cashless allows you to track every transaction easily and leads to more accurate accounting, which increases efficiency and your bottom line.</p>
<h2>Cons of Going Cashless for Small Businesses</h2>
<p>There are some obvious drawbacks to deciding not to accept cash at your business, as evidenced by Shake Shack’s reversal of their decision to go cashless. Sweetgreen, an early adopter of cashless business, recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-25/after-outrage-sweetgreen-will-accept-cash-again">made the decision to accept cash again</a> due to the controversy surrounding cashless businesses. Here are a few reasons your business might not want to go cashless.</p>
<h3>1. Pay more credit card fees</h3>
<p>With credit card fees as high as 3 percent or 4 percent on each purchase, business owners spend a small fortune on credit card transactions every year. This fee is why many independent businesses are still cash-only or charge customers a fee for credit card use. Other businesses are forced to build the credit card fees into their prices, which can mean losing some customers to the competition.</p>
<h3>2. You might lose customers</h3>
<p>Shake Shack, a popular NYC-based burger chain, attempted to go cashless but <a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/5/4/17320390/shake-shack-cashless-credit-card-kiosks">scrapped the plan</a> in 2018 after a series of angry customer complaints. Many children, older folks, and other typically unbanked or underbanked people are effectively prohibited from purchasing at your business at all if you go cashless. Other customers may feel alienated by the decision to no longer accept cash, which could result in negative publicity or even a boycott of your business. Customers who simply prefer to pay in cash, perhaps for privacy or data security reasons, or don’t have their cards on them, will also be forced to shop elsewhere. Some customers rely entirely on cash for budgeting purposes, as personal finance guru Dave Ramsey’s <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/envelope-system-explained">envelope method</a> for budgeting recommends. Consider if you really want to send the message that all those people can’t shop with you.</p>
<h3>3. There’s no way to accept payments if your system crashes</h3>
<p>Having your credit card system go down in the middle of the day is stressful enough, even with the recourse of accepting only cash until it’s back up. However, if your business goes cashless, you’ll be rendered unable to accept any form of payment at all in these situations.</p>
<h2>Discrimination and Legality Concerns in Cashless Businesses</h2>
<p>The ethical issues surrounding the trend toward cashless are thorny at best. Many customers and lawmakers consider the practice to be discriminatory, and in some cities and states, it’s even illegal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/philadelphia-is-first-u-s-city-to-ban-cashless-stores-11551967201">Philadelphia</a> became the first major US city to ban cashless practices in a new law that will require stores to accept cash starting in July 2019. <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/new-jersey-bans-cashless-retailers/">New Jersey</a> also passed a bill to ban cashless stores earlier this year, and <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIV/Chapter255D/Section10A">Massachusetts</a> has had such a law on the books for decades.</p>
<p>While New York City is home to an increasing number of cashless restaurants, at the time of this writing, NYC Councilmember Ritchie Torres is pushing for the city to ban them as well. He proposed a similar bill in the <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/02/14/nyc-council-considers-bills-to-force-shops-to-accept-cash-payments/">fall of 2018</a>. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUUa_iSzaWU">op-ed video</a> for NowThis News, Torres argues that American bills are printed with the statement, “This note is legal tender for all debts public and private” for a reason, and refusing to accept them constitutes illegal discrimination under the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>This concern seems especially understandable <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/71511/2000430-Where-Are-the-Unbanked-and-Underbanked-in-New-York-City.pdf">in NYC</a>, where the share of unbanked and underbanked households is more than 36 percent, higher than the national average. 27.7 percent of American households overall fall into one of those two categories, with 7.7 percent of them are unbanked, meaning they don’t have a bank account at all.</p>
<p>Why would someone not have a bank account? There are a few common reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, most checking accounts require a minimum opening deposit, and they may also come with monthly maintenance fees and requirements to maintain a minimum monthly balance, which is out of reach for many Americans living in poverty. They also require a government-issued form of identification and residential address, which homeless Americans do not have. Undocumented individuals are also unable to open a bank account. Finally, some consumers may be barred from opening a checking account due to a negative banking history. Most banks will check your banking history and deny any applicants who have evidence of mismanagement in previous bank accounts, typically by overdrawing them and failing to pay the accumulated fees.</p>
<p>In sum, the unbanked and underbanked tend to be the nation’s poorest, which is why Torres describes the push for cashless transactions in his video as “the disempowerment of America’s most vulnerable communities.”</p>
<h2>You Can Accept Cash While Encouraging Plastic</h2>
<p>Given the large segment of the US population that still relies on or prefers cash, it can be hard to justify going completely cashless. If you’re tempted by the time-saving benefits but worried about the potential drawbacks, consider continuing to accept cash but encouraging your customers to pay with a card if they can.</p>
<p>You can do this by installing cashless kiosks that speed up the ordering process or maintaining one cashless location, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/shake-shack-to-open-a-cashless-kiosk-in-new-york.html">Shake Shack did</a>. Another tactic is to implement a rewards or points program for customers who pay with a card.</p>
<p>We may arrive at a totally cashless society one day. But for now, it seems the US still has a lot of work to do—particularly when it comes to serving the underbanked—before we can embrace the cashless future.</p>

There’s also plenty of talk about the damage that can come as a side effect of the innovations which are designed to help society.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the discussion has focused on the potential demise of the retail industry (and there are valid reasons why). Trends in retail have been raising some pressing questions among observers. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the retail industry stand?</li>
<li>Where is the retail industry headed?</li>
<li>What can small businesses do to stay in the race with the likes of Amazon?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll touch on all this just below, and clear up a bit of the confusion while we’re at it.</p>
<h2>Retail Today</h2>
<p>Though the total number of retail stores closing in 2019 is estimated at over <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-closing-this-year-2019-2">4,000</a></span>, there are still companies that are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fool.com/slideshow/15-retailers-are-opening-stores/">opening new branches</a></span>. Target, Costco, Whole Foods, and even Apple are still in the process of growing their number of physical locations. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t a real concern in the physical retail market &#8211; there is.</p>
<p>When numbers come out that show retail trade sales have risen by more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf">2%</a></span> over the past year, it sounds like good news. In fact, the market value of retailing in the U.S. has risen by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">10.6%</span> over the past three years, and is projected to continue its upward trajectory through 2020. Appears promising, right?</p>
<p>Not exactly. So what’s the catch?</p>
<p>At the outset of 2019, retailers closed <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://coresight.com/research/us-store-closures-2019-outlook-no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/">23%</a></span> more brick-and-mortar locations than they had at the beginning of 2018. Among the companies that plan on shutting down stores in 2019 are Sears, Gap, Macy’s, and J.C. Penney. And if that doesn’t strike you as problematic for retail store owners, then consider this: online retail sales have increased by more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://economics.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/d/22004D50545F6E152540EF23F30FEDED/2A6E6DC8366E6655F1E87EB810D8F10A">300</a> percent</span> over the past 19 years.</p>
<p>These patterns mean that retail store owners will need to learn how to integrate with the changes that are yet to come.</p>
<h2>Retail Tomorrow</h2>
<p>Evolving technology has brought with it the ability to shop online, and the growing demand to have everything connected and available at the touch of a button. Since the ‘immediacy’ side-effect is more predominant in younger generations, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that the future belongs to those younger groups of people.</p>
<p>Today more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2576/us-millennials-internet-usage-and-online-shopping/">70 percent of Millennials</a></span> have an Amazon Prime membership, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.bain.com/contentassets/0b0b0e19099a448e83af2fb53a5630aa/bain20media20pack_the_millennial_state_of_mind.pdf">Bain &amp; Co.</a></span> estimates that by 2025, Millennials and Gen Z will make up 45 percent of the world’s “personal luxury goods market.” This points to a future where online shopping is going to be an<span style="font-style: italic;"> even more </span>dominant force than it is now.</p>
<p>These statistics shouldn’t worry small retail business owners too much though, since Bain &amp; Co. also predicts that by 2025 roughly 75 percent of luxury goods purchases will still be made at a physical location. That simply means that consumers will want to see conveniences of advanced technology being incorporated into the ‘physical’ shopping experience.</p>
<p>When people enter physical retail stores in the coming years, they’ll encounter more examples of how technology is playing its role.</p>
<p>These innovations are already present in stores that let customers use <span style="text-decoration: underline;">online payment solutions</span> to make their purchases. More intriguing uses of technology are steadily being developed, including facial recognition technology that lets store associates know when another checkout line needs to be opened, and smartphone apps that allow you to see how furniture will fit in your home in augmented reality (AR).</p>
<p>Although it’s impossible to know for sure what the future will bring, there are ways to prepare&#8230;</p>
<h2>Strategies for Small Business Success in Retail</h2>
<p>How can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small retailers stay competitive</span> with companies like Amazon and Alibaba? Here are 5 easy ways to take advantage of being the ‘underdog’:</p>
<h3>1. Build personal relationships with customers</h3>
<p>Discounts and rewards are nice, but nothing has quite the same impact as offering stellar customer service. Go the extra mile to offer a product or service that best fits a customer’s needs. Pay attention to what your customer says &#8211; use their name when corresponding to show that they truly matter. Corporations will often automate their customer service, so take advantage of your human-touch.</p>
<h3>2. Find your niche</h3>
<p>Having all of the products that one might need in a single location is a huge advantage for customers who are looking to purchase a lot of different things without having to bounce from store to store. However, when customers are looking for one specific product (let’s say a top-notch wetsuit, for example), chances are they’d rather take advice from an expert (like an experienced scuba diver) instead of someone working at Amazon or Walmart.</p>
<p>If you find a niche and make your expertise clear, you’ll command more authority within that niche. Specialize your business so that you can draw in customers by offering specific content and wisdom that they won’t get from corporations.</p>
<h3>3. Reach out to other small businesses</h3>
<p>When the marketplace gets more competitive, small business owners often times work harder against one another. Instead, by establishing partnerships with other small businesses, it can become easier to stake your claim in your industry. See what sort of promotions or special deals can be worked out for the benefit of all participants. It will also help with earning a good reputation in the local community.</p>
<h3>4. Show your personality</h3>
<p>Big corporations will try to make themselves relatable to their customers, but how many people will feel a connection with carefully weighed slogans and stock photo advertisements? When it comes to being personable, the advantage clearly goes to small businesses who have a much easier time telling their unique story.</p>
<p>Research has shown that customers who feel a connection with a business on a personal level are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/02/26/lets-get-emotional-the-future-of-online-marketing/#294270ed4d0c">7 times more likely</a></span> to purchase from that company. Don’t underestimate the importance of showing your authentic self.</p>
<h3>5. Move fast</h3>
<p>Corporations put immense amounts of effort into perfecting their products and services, which is a big reason why those companies do so well. But, although every smart business owner should invest resources into optimizing their business plan, there’s a huge advantage to small businesses who will find it easier to make changes along the way.</p>
<p>If a corporation wants to change virtually any part of the business, there are tons of bureaucratic hoops that will need to be jumped through. When a small business wants to make a change, there are fewer people that need to be consulted, less paperwork, and so on. Use this benefit to find out what works for your business, and what doesn’t.</p>
<h2>Summing it up</h2>
<p>While big corporations have the benefit of expendable resources, what they tend to focus on is ramping up the volume of sales. That leaves a lot of room for small business owners to make the most of the blind spots left over.</p>
<p>Where corporations can feel like faceless logos, small businesses can actually put a face (and a personality) to the name.</p>
<p>Where corporate retailers can cover a very broad range of goods, small businesses can specialize in a specific audience to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bring in more customers</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, while changes take loads of effort for corporations to put into effect, small businesses have the ability to make adjustments more easily.</p>
<p>When you hear about ‘technology’ you think of smartphones and self-driving cars, but technology has had many more subtle yet profound impacts on the world of retail. Recent trends in the retail industry have shown a serious shift towards online shopping, along with the closing of thousands of physical retail locations. These changes have left many business owners wondering how to compete and stand out.</p>
<p>Challenges for small retail business owners are on the horizon, but there are steps that can be taken for them to keep their doors open. After all, it’s not the size of the dog in the fight—it’s the size of the fight in the dog that matters. Only time will tell how the retail industry will persist in these times of change, so be sure to stay up-to-date with market trends on a regular basis.</p>
