It provides coverage to small businesses for claims resulting from bodily injury, property damage, copyright infringement, and reputation harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look more closely at what general liability insurance covers, what it doesn’t cover, and who needs it. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance coverage protects your business from some of the most common claims </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/llc-business-taxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business owners face</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Paying for any one of these would be incredibly expensive without some kind of business insurance to cover you. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party bodily injury</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a brick-and-mortar business and a customer is injured at your store, you’re responsible for covering their medical costs. Not to mention, if it’s determined that the accident is your fault, that customer could decide to sue you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unfortunately, these types of accidents are not uncommon. </span><a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2015/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Hartford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 10% of businesses have a customer slip and fall on their premises, and these accidents cost about $30,000 to resolve. General liability insurance will cover any costs involved with a customer accident. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party property damage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property damage is another common liability claim. This happens when a customer’s property is damaged while they are at your business or when a customer’s property is damaged while you’re visiting them on business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of this is a general contractor accidentally damaging a client’s property while working on their home. As a business owner, you’re responsible for paying for the necessary repairs. General liability insurance will cover some or all of the associated costs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement happens when you’re accused of stealing someone else’s ideas and using them in your marketing or advertising. It can also involve claims that you copied another company’s product and sold it as your own. This can be an expensive problem to fix, especially if it leads to a lawsuit. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm happens when you make a public statement about a business owner that hurts their business. According to The Hartford, reputation management is the most expensive problem most businesses encounter and can cost up to $50,000 to fix. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Isn’t Covered By Business Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business liability insurance is a comprehensive insurance policy that covers some of the most common incidents business owners face. But it doesn’t cover everything, and knowing what isn’t covered is just as important as knowing what is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no insurance policy is the same, so you should check the policy guidelines for your general liability insurance policy. But here are some of the most common exclusions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Auto accidents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> general liability insurance doesn’t cover auto accidents that happen while you or your employees are on the job. Commercial auto insurance can protect you from these types of accidents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employee injuries: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee becomes injured as a result of their work, general liability insurance doesn’t cover that either. Workers’ compensation insurance protects employees from workplace accidents or illnesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Damage to your property:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> General liability insurance protects you from damage to a customer’s property, but it won’t protect you from your own property damage. Commercial property insurance can help with that.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Professional errors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, general liability insurance won’t cover you if a customer sues you due to a professional error that harms their business. Professional liability insurance will help with that. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s always a good idea to be aware of the coverage limits on your general liability policy. If you feel like your coverage is a bit low, it may be worthwhile to purchase a commercial umbrella insurance policy to cover more expensive claims.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Coverage Do I Need?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/cost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Insureon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most small businesses choose a standard coverage limit of $1 million per occurrence with a $2 million aggregate policy limit. So for a single claim, you’ll receive up to $1 million with a $2 million limit for that policy period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you will have to pay the insurance deductible before the insurance company will payout on your claim. You’ll choose your deductible when you initially purchase general liability insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of your deductible, the type of business you run, and your industry will all affect your monthly insurance rate. Insureon also found that the median cost of general liability insurance is $42 per month or $500 annually. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Needs General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most states won’t require business owners to carry small business liability insurance, so you can purchase this insurance at your own discretion. But if you choose to forgo general liability insurance, you could be putting your business and your livelihood at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, most businesses need general liability insurance, especially if you own an office or storefront that’s open to customers or vendors. And some clients may not want to do business with you unless you can show proof of insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should strongly consider purchasing business liability insurance if any of the following apply to your business: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a store or office building that’s open to clients, customers, or vendors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly do work on a client’s physical property</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly create advertising or marketing campaigns for your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You use social media for advertising your business and communicating with customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rent or own commercial property</span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bottom Line</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can save you from some of the most common accidents small businesses face. Suppose a customer is injured at your workplace, or you accidentally damage their property. In that case, business liability insurance will protect you from any medical bills and lawsuits that arise as a result. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I need liability insurance for my small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most small businesses can benefit from general liability insurance. It is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can protect you financially if you’re ever involved in a lawsuit or if a customer is injured on your property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate an office or storefront that’s open to customers, work on a customer’s property, or own commercial property, you should probably purchase small business liability insurance. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does general liability insurance cover for a small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance covers claims related to the following incidents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bodily injury:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A customer has an accident or is injured on your business premises.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Property damage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You accidentally damage a customer’s property during business operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Copyright infringement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re accused of stealing another company’s ideas and using them in a marketing or advertising campaign.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reputation harm: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re accused of slandering another company, and it damages their business.</span></li>
</ul>

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million job openings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country this summer, marking the highest number ever on record. With more jobs available than people searching for them—and with </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of Americans quitting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—small businesses are struggling to find and hire new employees.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To capture the attention of job seekers in the current climate, business owners need to stand out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer the right incentives. Here are four smart ways to attract qualified candidates (beyond just posting a job ad):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Expand your online presence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business’s online presence takes upfront work and consistent effort, but it’s an effective way to draw potential employees in. These four strategies can help your business become more visible and memorable. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Post frequently on LinkedIn: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn is the platform for job hunting and referrals, so it’s a good place for employees to learn about your business. In addition to posting job ads and industry updates, you may want to spotlight employees, feature positive customer reviews, and share your business’s accomplishments or achievements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tap into social media: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-tips-planning-social-media-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the easiest ways to get in front of prospective employees. When you’re brainstorming post ideas, think of how you can get job candidates excited while staying authentic to your brand and style. If you run a bakery, for example, you could share a behind-the-scenes video of how you make your croissants. If you operate a dental office, you could make an infographic that breaks down your employee benefits and workplace perks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improve your website:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your business’s website is usually the first place job candidates visit when researching an open role, so it’s crucial to make a positive impact. Start by revamping your landing page so it’s visually intriguing, scannable, and informative. Next, update your “careers” page with more information about your business, workplace culture, and employee benefits. You may also want to update your business’s “about” section or include relevant keywords throughout your site to improve SEO.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Alert the presses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive press can pique the interest of job seekers. Consider writing a press release to announce good business news, like an expansion or new product launch. You could also reach out to local news outlets to pitch a story about your business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Share job ads with niche communities </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a job ad on a job search website is like shouting into the void; your post can get buried under thousands of other similar ads. Instead of relying solely on job search sites, make an effort to show up in the places where prospective employees spend their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by listing out the skills, qualifications, and experience level necessary for the roles you’re hiring for. From there, research activities, communities, and groups that line up with the skills and qualifications you outlined. For example, if you need hard-working summer staff for your beach cafe, you could post a flyer at a nearby high school. If you’re looking for employees with basic medical knowledge to work at your orthopedic practice, you could share your job ad in the local university newsletter or campus pre-med Facebook community.   </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Lead with your values and workplace culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees today have higher expectations for the businesses they work at. The </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">majority of employees want three things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a 2021 McKinsey report: a better work-life balance, more flexibility, and more emphasis on well-being at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To attract job candidates, it’s important to explain </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what you can offer employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beyond a paycheck. On your business website, in your job ads, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your online platforms, work on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Share your business’s values: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees want to work for companies that align with their beliefs and support causes they care about. By openly discussing your business’s values and bigger purpose—whether it’s to expand education or support your local community—you can attract job candidates who will be excited and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motivated to work for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Highlight your workplace culture: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describe your unique workplace culture on your website and in your social media posts and job ads. Maybe you give employees flexible arrival and departure times, for example. Or maybe you encourage everyone to share ideas in company meetings or take a certain amount of time off every quarter. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Revisit your compensation structure and benefits package </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter how often you post on social media or how widely you distribute your job ads—if you don’t offer competitive compensation and attractive benefits, you’ll have a difficult time filling open positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restructuring your compensation and benefits offerings may require you to drastically change your budget and company policies, but taking action now can pay dividends in the long term. Here are three tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consult your accountant: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To figure out what you can realistically offer current and potential employees, start by examining your finances. Meet with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountant-can-business-cant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ask what’s feasible. Can you bump up the base salary for certain positions, for example, or give quarterly bonuses to employees who reach specific sales targets? It’s also important to look at industry standards and check out what your competitors are currently doing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/equal-pay-employer/"><b>Ensure pay equity</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider hiring an outside expert to review your compensation plan for equity and inclusivity. An expert can assess whether there are any pay gaps, then give you practical recommendations for resolving them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reevaluate your benefits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to a 2020 study from MetLife, a comprehensive benefits package is the </span><a href="https://www.metlife.com/content/dam/metlifecom/us/ebts/pdf/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number three driver of employee well-being</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reevaluate your offerings, do some industry research or survey your employees to ask about their needs. Then consider what you can offer in addition to health insurance. The possibilities are endless. Think: extended disability leave, stipends for mental health services, reimbursements for fitness subscriptions, paid lunches, and additional vacation time.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining employees </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding qualified employees to fill the gaps in your business can be tricky—which is why it’s critical to put just as much effort toward </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as you do recruiting. Once you hire your employees, aim to do the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest time in proper onboarding and training, so employees understand their roles and responsibilities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly check in with employees to find out what they need. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give employees opportunities to grow professionally and personally. </span></li>
</ul>

You also need to</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-retain-millennial-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">retain these employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you fail to keep them around, you might find yourself in a vicious cycle of hire-train-repeat (an endeavor that can be costly, time-consuming and aggravating).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things you, as a small business owner, can do to avoid this vicious cycle is to help your employees stay motivated. Not only are motivated employees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees, they are also less likely to say “I quit” in response to on-the-job challenges and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely to consistently produce high-quality work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, exactly, does it take to motivate? It really all comes down to a few enduring motivational techniques. Here are five reliable ways to motivate the people who work for your small business so that they, in turn, will give your business the best that they’ve got.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Provide freedom and flexibility to your team members</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your team is remote or working on site, the level of motivation among individual employees is bound to be higher if they don’t feel trapped by a micromanaging boss who demands a detailed account of how they spend their time each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than concerning yourself with how many hours people are spending in front of their computers, allow them to structure their workweeks as they see fit. Does someone need to leave at 3pm to take a child to soccer practice, or put in a few extra hours on Wednesday and Thursday so they can take Friday afternoon off to tend to a personal matter (the scenarios are endless, but you catch the drift)? No problem, so long as they are holding up their end of the bargain (i.e. getting all of their work done on time). They’ll appreciate the autonomy and, in return, are that much more likely to spend their working hours in a state of focus rather than a state of clock watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service-oriented businesses may find this concept less feasible, considering you can’t exactly allow retail employees or receptionists to come and go as they please. However, that does not make this motivational technique null and void for such businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider letting employees request the days and hours they want to work rather than simply assigning shifts and time slots. Let them choose when they take their breaks. Be gracious if they need to make changes (even if those changes are sometimes last minute, because emergencies happen) and make sure they know whom to notify or talk to about needs related to their scheduled work hours.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Trust your employees to do their jobs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the same lines as providing freedom and flexibility, trusting them to do their jobs is a key piece of the motivational puzzle. Assuming you made great hires, they probably don’t need an overseer keeping tabs on them or telling them how to complete their work. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t provide tools and training when tools and training are needed (you should!). It simply means your employees will feel more motivated to do great work if they believe that their boss considers them capable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practically speaking, one way to let your employees know that you trust them is to avoid looking over their shoulders all the time, demanding that they follow your processes and methodologies. Instead, concern yourself with the final product,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">assuming that whatever processes and methodologies they choose (within reason, of course) will lead to the results you want. As long as expectations are clearly communicated, a positive outcome is probable.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Show appreciation and recognize achievements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By showing appreciation, we are not referring to a quick ‘thx’ text message sent in response to “the report will be delivered by 5pm.” We’re talking about those small but tangible things you can do to truly make your employees feel valued, like treating them to coffee, offering an extra personal day, sending flowers on their birthday, or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating employee appreciation day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The options are endless and they don’t have to be grandiose. All they have to be is genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re at it, take note of the fact that employees are also highly motivated by receiving recognition for a job well done. Did someone knock that presentation out of the park? Win over a tough-as-nails client? Solve a stubborn technology problem? Let them know you noticed. Whether that involves something as basic walking over to their desk and telling them you how much you appreciate their hard work or something as major as giving them a promotion and a raise is up to you, but the fact of the matter is you are more likely to see results like this again and again when their achievements are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledged</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again and again.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Give employees jobs that matches their interests and skills</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you hire a new employee and they inadvertently wind up doing tasks that aren’t listed in their official job description (which they may or may not appreciate). Sometimes, time reveals that your sales assistant’s skills are more on par with a sales </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manager</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role or that your customer relations coordinator, despite a rock-solid work ethic, isn’t a good fit for a job that involves direct communication with customers. Regardless of the specifics, keeping someone in a job that doesn’t suit them, or one they have outgrown, is a surefire way to destroy motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remedy? Make sure all of your employees are in the right roles. Promote when the time is right, reassign people to other jobs when necessary and listen to what your employees are saying about their ideas and work-related goals. The other option, letting people languish in positions that aren&#8217;t right for them, is pretty much a guarantee that you’ll either lose good employers to other jobs or have a team full of discontented folks who are constantly counting down the minutes to the weekend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Compensate your employees fairly</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Seattle business owner made headlines several years ago when he decided to phase in a $70K per year minimum wage for all employees, something that led to a significant salary increase for many of them (he cut his own salary from $1.1 million </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $70K to help fund the new pay scale). Evidently, this action resulted in higher levels of productivity and job satisfaction, across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, of course, is an extreme case (few small business owners have the budget to establish this sort of compensation program). However, the reported success of this program makes the point that employees are often more motivated to do good work if they feel they are being paid fairly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make this a reality among your employees by staying on top of your industry’s salary trends and making sure the compensation you offer is in range (because underpaid employees are bound to lose motivation, sooner rather than later).</span></p>

If you start to falter, your business will, too. How can you keep your energy and productivity levels up when the demands on your time are never-ending? Here are tips to help keep you invigorated all day long.</p>
<h2><strong>7 Productivity Tips to Stay Energized All Day</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get enough sleep</strong></h3>
<p>Getting enough Z&#8217;s is easier said than done for a small business owner, but you simply must make time to rejuvenate—studies have linked getting fewer than 6 hours of sleep a night to a host of health problems, including greater risk of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-metabolic-syndrome-idUSKCN0SG2OG20151022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diabetes and heart disease</a>. Figure out how you can delegate or eliminate tasks that keep you up at night. Check out these <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/05/10/sleep-tips-and-strategies-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep-from-arianna-huffington/#7f23e18a3b41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 tips for getting better sleep</a> from entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, whose new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Revolution-Transforming-Your-Night/dp/1101904003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sleep Revolution</em></a> promotes the importance of adequate sleep for improved productivity.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Eat right</strong></h3>
<p>Do you regularly skip breakfast? Are you too busy to grab lunch? Bad idea. Eating smaller meals and healthy snacks on a regular schedule ensures your blood sugar (and energy levels) stay stable and helps you maximize productivity. It also keeps you from getting so hungry that you head to the nearest vending machine or fast-food drive-thru. Eat mostly lean proteins, fruits, vegetables and whole grains; cut back on sugar and processed foods, which make you sluggish. Small snacks that combine protein and fiber will fill you up without weighing you down.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Stay hydrated</strong></h3>
<p>Often, what seems like fatigue or hunger is just dehydration. Aim to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day, and next time you feel tired, try downing a glass to see if that helps. Avoid (or at least limit your intake of) alcohol—it&#8217;s dehydrating. If plain water is too boring, add lemon, lime, or cucumber slices to give it some flavor. Need caffeine? If you must drink coffee or tea, balance out their dehydrating effects by drinking an equal amount of water.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Take breaks</strong></h3>
<p>Ever notice when you grind on and on at work for hours, you get less productive and more distracted? It&#8217;s not your imagination. Keep your energy high by taking regular short breaks throughout the day. The <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pomodoro Technique</a>, which alternates 25-minute stretches of work with 5-minute breaks, is a well-known system for doing this, but you can also create your own system by setting a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stand-up!-the-work-break-timer/id828244687?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work break timer</a> on your phone or computer to remind you when to get up, move around, and/or do some stretches.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Get active</strong></h3>
<p>Find a way to fit in a regular fitness routine, whether it&#8217;s walking, running, Pilates, or hitting the gym. You don&#8217;t have to be an Ironman to benefit, either—even moderate exercise has health benefits that positively impact your energy level. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=D9HQCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Robert+Thayer,+PhD+study+10+minute+walk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tWOcfBmqOr&amp;sig=yJM8W1h1NBKaWzqcM3hBmSPrC8M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilmsn6y9LMAhVGm5QKHSKoD4QQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Thayer%2C%20PhD%20study%2010%20minute%20walk&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experiments by Robert Thayer</a>, Ph.D., of California State University showed taking a brisk 10-minute walk boosted subjects&#8217; energy for up to two hours afterwards. That makes taking a quick walk a great option for your breaks. You can combine walking with work by walking around and talking to employees or holding &#8220;walking meetings.&#8221;</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Lessen stress</strong></h3>
<p>Sure, some stress is good and keeps us energized, but too much stress on an ongoing basis saps your energy levels. Figure out what your biggest stressors are, and develop a plan to tame them. That can mean delegating responsibilities, changing how you run your business, or even saying so long to that client who gives you heartburn. Meditation, prayer, and finding a sounding board—whether that&#8217;s a board of advisors, a friend or family member—can also help ease your stress.</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Mix it up</strong></h3>
<p>Variety is the spice of life—and business. Doing the same thing all day can steal your energy, so change your routine whenever possible. For instance, if you&#8217;ve been in meetings all morning, take some quiet time in the afternoon to focus on a project that needs your full attention. Or, if you&#8217;ve been staring at Excel spreadsheets all day, going to lunch or dinner with a colleague should hopefully energize you.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Asian business woman using iPad to network with outsourced providers and partners." loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_746005777.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the hardest-working entrepreneur can’t do everything on their own. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At some point, every small business owner needs to hire a team if they want their companies to get to the next level. While some roles require dedicated personnel—such as start-up&#8217;s need for a handful of full-time developers in-house—other responsibilities are often better suited for contractors, agencies, and freelancers. This article explains the outsourcing process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about outsourcing some of the tasks your team is dealing with on a regular basis, take comfort in the fact you’re not alone. In fact, one </span><a href="https://fortunly.com/statistics/outsourcing-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 54 percent of businesses work with third-party entities to achieve their objectives. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do companies choose to outsource work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, small businesses usually decide to outsource work for two reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, they might simply not have enough room in the budget to hire a full-time employee, guaranteeing their salary, covering their benefits, and taking care of payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, as every entrepreneur knows too well, there are never enough hours in the day. So, as operations start to scale, small business owners often decide to outsource certain tasks they’ve taken care of since the beginning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an entrepreneur might decide to hire a payroll company for small businesses instead of taking care of accounting functions every quarter. As a result, there’s more time to spend on everything else.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of outsourcing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason more and more small business owners are working with contractors, freelancers, and third-party agencies: The benefits of outsourcing—which we’ll briefly explore next—are numerous.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. More time to focus on the bigger picture</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As all business owners know too well, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/serenitygibbons/2020/07/16/why-entrepreneurs-should-prioritize-time-management-within-their-businesses/?sh=2a036de29a8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">time is a limiting factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it might have been easy enough to write a couple blog posts, send out invoices, and handle other administrative responsibilities in the past, there comes a point when small business owners need to step away from these tasks and learn the power of delegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing work, small business owners are able to reclaim time each week they can then invest in other more important areas of operations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Hire experts to do specific tasks</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because you’re not taking care of something on your own any more doesn’t mean quality will suffer. In fact, the opposite is often true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue the above example, most small business owners aren’t experts in copywriting, accounting, and people ops. They’re experts in their business’ core functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing the right tasks to better-qualified parties, small business owners are usually able to ensure the resulting outcomes are more impactful than if they took care of the same things themselves.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Get the job done cost-effectively</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way around it: Hiring employees is expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are businesses responsible for payroll taxes and benefits, they also have to devote resources to sourcing and interviewing candidates. Once an employee is hired, the work is just beginning. Companies usually have to invest a lot of resources into </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/professional-services-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiring and training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other hidden costs to consider, too. For example, depending on how many employees you have, you might have to hire additional workers (e.g., managers and an HR professional). There are also costs associated with equipment, utilities, office space, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, outsourcing certain tasks lets you bypass this altogether. You end up getting to leverage someone else’s expertise without having to break the bank or absorb tons of indirect costs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Invest in other areas of growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re spending less money on payroll while outsourcing, there’s more budget to devote elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you run a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landscaping company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might decide to sponsor a local Little League team with your savings. If you run a restaurant, you might decide to put your savings from outsourcing toward </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying a food truck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening another location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you could always decide to put any excess funds aside and save them for a rainy day. As far too many small business owners learned the hard way in 2020, an emergency fund is more than just a nice to have.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Improve business continuity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of 2020, all business owners know how rapidly things can change. Everything can be going swimmingly one day, and then all of a sudden, an unforeseen event can rear its ugly head, derailing operations overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By joining forces with third parties, entrepreneurs can mitigate some of this risk while improving business continuity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, imagine a business headquartered in Colorado loses power during a massive blizzard. The business has partnered with a marketing agency in New York City and a freelance accountant in Austin, Texas. Even though their own doors may be closed, the marketing agency and accounting professional can keep plugging away, making sure work doesn’t grind to a halt entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you have a solid understanding about the benefits of outsourcing. That said, just because outsourcing can help you grow your business doesn’t mean you should outsource </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">task. Up next, we’ll explore some of the more common tasks small business owners try to route to other professionals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should small businesses outsource?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every small business is unique, there are still a number of threads that tie them all together. In most cases, here are some of the responsibilities that small business owners outsource most often:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Marketing. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of writing blogs or designing ebooks by yourself, consider enlisting the services of freelancers who can take care of these tasks for you. The right partners will be able to produce high-quality content reliably, freeing you to focus on other needs.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Web design. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still using a template-based, do-it-yourself website builder, it’s probably time to give your site a makeover. Enlist a talented agency to take care of this for you. That way, you’ll end up with an incredible digital property on the other side—and you won’t have to waste countless hours making tweak after tweak. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accounting. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There comes a time when every owner of a growing business needs to step away from processing invoices, paying bills and taxes, and making sure employees are paid on time. In the digital age when a solution only is a quick search away, one of the easiest tasks to outsource is accounting.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>HR. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you don’t have time to make sure every new hire has signed each form, enrolled in health insurance, and has gotten up to speed with every policy and procedure. Luckily, human resources for small business services are popping up every day. Again, a quick search will find the answers you’re looking for.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have an idea of the kinds of tasks your small business can outsource, let’s turn our attention to some of the things you should keep in mind before deciding to hire consultants, freelancers, and third-party agencies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you consider before outsourcing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While outsourcing can be incredibly helpful to many small businesses, you can’t just decide to outsource any old task and expect great results. Here are some of the questions to ask yourself as you whittle down your options.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Is this mission-critical or is this something I should delegate?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If something is absolutely critical to your operations, by all means keep that responsibility on your own plate. The last thing you want to do is to outsource a really important task to someone only to find out the hard way they made a costly mistake.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Is this the right move for the long term?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right approach, outsourcing can help you grow your business. That said, it’s important that you don’t sacrifice long-term potential for short-term gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you have a dedicated employee who’s looking to develop more skills, it may make more sense, in certain scenarios, to train that individual to level up instead of contracting a third-party’s services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, in an age where more and more workers expect jobs to be </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional development opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this could have a massive impact on employee retention and productivity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Can I afford to pay freelancers and contractors?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about outsourcing work and enlisting the services of freelancers, contractors, and third-party agencies, that’s awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just need to make sure you have the cash needed to pay them for their services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it: Every small business owner worries about cash flow—at least from time to time. While working with third parties can be the more cost-effective option in many cases, you still need to be able to settle up invoices if you want your outsourcing initiatives to succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the ideal world, you’ll always have cash on hand to pay contractors on time each and every time. But in the real world, you might run into a scenario where money’s tight and you need to turn to an outside source of financing to settle your bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to worry: By securing a flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the funds you need to pay your near-term debts are always at your fingertips.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What tasks are you going to outsource?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No entrepreneur can do it all by themselves. Truth be told, there comes a time in every small business owner’s life when outsourcing tasks is a necessity for taking the company to the next level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re reading these words, you’re on the precipice of witnessing the upside of outsourcing first hand. Form a plan, start small, take things piece by piece, and you’ll do just fine.</span></p>

You feel pulled in many different directions, unable to focus on any one thing at a time. You’re anxious and bogged down with stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are you going to get through this while getting things done well and on time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in learning more about handling stress effectively, you’ve come to the right place. This article provides several methods for dealing with stress—and tips on handling stress when you’re working from home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Make a short list</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in handling stress at work is to put away the massive to-do list and focus on what is most important. If you’re wondering how to relieve stress, you may find the answer you’re looking for by simply trying to focus on fewer tasks at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try making your own list of three priorities, then focus only on the top item on your list until it’s completed. If your high-priority items are too complex to complete in a day, then you probably need to break them down further into more manageable bite-size tasks.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Call in reinforcements</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelming moments are the perfect time to lean on your support network. You may have a partner or team member who can take some work off of your plate, reducing the number of potential stressors in your day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For you, the best reinforcements might come in the form of people who can take on some of your non-work responsibilities (e.g., childcare, cleaning, and running errands). That way, you can focus on your work. In other cases, it might be telling your boss you need a mental health day and asking them to reassign work accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the key is to ask for help when you need it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Take a breather</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When things get especially tense—like when you’re putting the final touches on a presentation you have to give next week—sometimes the best thing you can do is walk away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best stress management techniques is simply giving yourself a 30-minute break (or longer, if needed) to reset your psyche and get yourself centered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A break can do wonders for perspective, too. Maybe you’re getting stressed out about things that aren’t all that important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a deep breath, relax, and when the time comes, you’ll be able to deliver a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-deliver-stress-free-presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress-free presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that lives up to the high bar you set for yourself.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Turn up the music</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/jobs/how-music-can-improve-worker-productivity-workstation.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music can boost productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so pick some of your favorite tunes to play in the background while you focus on your three high-priority items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your line of work, you may find that the louder the music, the more motivated you become. The “psyching up” period usually happens in just a song or two, so you don’t need to necessarily blast the tunes all day long (thankfully!).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Say ‘no’ to potential new stress sources</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your stress is stemming from simply having too much to do, it may be time to start saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as you may want to do everything and be there for everyone, it’s not always realistic. When you reach the critical point when something has to give, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2020/10/21/how-to-say-no-to-at-work/?sh=5243e8e04b19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the only option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Go for a run</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good sweat can be the perfect way to reset your mood and get yourself motivated to work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try going for a run, or a walk, or to the gym—anything that gets your blood flowing and forces you to break a sweat. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, you can burn off some of the anxiety and come back to work calmer and more focused.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Wait until tomorrow</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all else fails, the answer may be in just leaving it all until tomorrow. This is especially true if you’re </span><a href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/development/tp/avoid-burnout-in-your-small-business.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tired and burnt out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you reach that point, sleep can help solve the problem. Get a good night’s sleep and come back to your list in the morning when you’re fresh and ready to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you recognize the signs of overwhelming stress approaching, any of these tips should help you rein it in and take back control. As you discover more tricks that work for you, create an emergency checklist to keep on your desk so you know exactly what to do next.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handling stress when working from home</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work has always been a major stressor for many of us. But the pandemic compounded this reality even further. As more and more people found themselves forced to work from home for months on end — in many cases stuck with their children, too—</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/03/the-stress-of-working-from-home-is-getting-to-most-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work became even more stressful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for many professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn some tips and tricks about what you can do to manage stress effectively when you find yourself stuck at home.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does working from home reduce stress?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, research suggested that working from home could actually be a </span><a href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/the-benefits-of-working-from-home#:~:text=A%202011%20study%20from%20Staples,as%20well%20as%20eat%20healthier." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stress reliever</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Of course, there’s a massive difference between working from home when your kids and spouse are elsewhere and working from home when everyone’s packed in your house like sardines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, handling stress in remote environments is possible with the right approach—whether you’re stuck with your family or not (more on this in a bit).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the challenges of working from home?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home isn’t all roses — even for the employees who vastly prefer it to working in the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, not everyone is a self-motivated individual. When you’re working from home, you might struggle to manage your schedule and your time effectively. On top of that, some remote workers have a hard time separating their personal and professional lives. They might find themselves sitting on the couch at 10 p.m. watching a movie while thumbing through their inbox and replying to work emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, working from home gives employees access to an endless number of distractions. Do I really need to take care of this project right now or can I play my guitar for 20 minutes instead? Because they’re stuck at home and miss out on the social aspect of the office, some remote employees also suffer from social isolation. too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you handle stress when working from home?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that it’s possible to manage stress effectively while working from home. In fact, studies have found that </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15259-working-from-home-more-productive.html#:~:text=Working%20From%20Home%20Increases%20Productivity&amp;text=According%20to%20one%20study%2C%20remote,weeks%20of%20work%20per%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote workers can be more productive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their in-office counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may very well be able to mimic those results. You just need the right approach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re stressed out working from home, some tips to consider are creating a dedicated workspace that’s conducive to your productivity, establishing a morning routine, and investing in tools that can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fleet-management-business-savings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">save your business time and stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you should also be cognizant of the fact your colleagues or employees may be struggling while working at home. To this end, make sure your business invests in communication and collaboration tools that make it easy for your team to stay connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers may also want to think outside the box and host virtual team-building events on a platform like Zoom. For example, you might hire a chef to teach the team how to cook a meal, with everyone trying to recreate the same meal in their own kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it boils down to it, stress is an unavoidable part of work—whether you’re in an office, at your house, or working somewhere else entirely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By mastering the art of handling stress and knowing how to defuse stress when it invariably rears its ugly head, you can stay productive in any working environment—much to the delight of your team, your customers, and your bottom line.</span></p>

Without their effort and ingenuity, your business wouldn’t even be running. That’s why it’s crucial to show your employees how much you value them as individuals </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee Appreciation Day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is coming up on March 4th—and there are countless ways to celebrate. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is employee appreciation important? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee appreciation isn’t just a nice gesture—it’s critical to your employees’ wellbeing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your company’s bottom line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a simple but powerful equation: when you care for your employees, employees are happier and more productive at work. In fact, employees who feel like they can be their authentic selves on the job are </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/datasheets/salesforce-research-2017-workplace-equality-and-values-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.4 times more likely to perform their best work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Salesforce’s 2017 Workplace Equality and Values Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when employees are engaged at work and invested in your company’s success, your entire business benefits. A 2018 Gallup poll found that businesses with employees in the top quartile of engagement have </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-engagement-rise.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21% higher profitability than those in the bottom quartile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Having </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-creative-ways-to-find-great-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loyal, happy employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means more satisfied customers, lower job turnover, and less money spent on recruitment, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and training. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to improve employee satisfaction and celebrate Employee Appreciation Day</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving employee satisfaction across your company comes down to showing your appreciation—financially, professionally, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> personally. Here are eight powerful </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee appreciation ideas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get started: </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Survey your employees</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to taking better care of your employees is figuring out what they want. Consider sending out an anonymous email survey to your employees asking for their candid feedback on your company’s benefits, workplace culture, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunities, schedule, and management.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, you can review the data and look for patterns or problem areas. For example, maybe your employees are content with their salaries but want more autonomy at work. Or perhaps you’re noticing a lot of complaints around health insurance, but positive responses around the collaborative company culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveying your employees can help you identify issues and formulate a plan to address them. Don’t forget to follow up with your employees. In addition to executing changes, check in with them every month or quarter to see how they’re doing. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Invest in employee recognition</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee recognition is essential to employee satisfaction. Eighty-two percent of employees in a 2019 Bonusly survey said </span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/employee-recognition-and-retention/?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they’re happier at work when they’re recognized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When employees are happy, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retention rates go up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the same survey, 63% of employees who were regularly recognized at work said they were unlikely to look for a new job, whereas 43% of employees who were never or rarely recognized said they were extremely likely to seek out work elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging your employees doesn’t have to be complicated. You can praise someone’s work during a company-wide meeting, deliver a handwritten thank you note for a job well done, or give your employees a half day off after a particularly hectic month or quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other ideas include celebrating your employees’ work anniversaries, handing out annual bonuses, and acknowledging important life milestones with balloons or a card. You could even create a peer-to-peer recognition program where you encourage employees to nominate each other for a monthly or quarterly employee appreciation reward. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Offer flexible work hours</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses move online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, employees are craving flexible work hours. In a 2019 survey from FlexJobs, 72% of workers said </span><a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/survey-flexible-work-job-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a flexible schedule is their second most desired work option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind full-time remote work. Giving your employees more autonomy and flexibility over their work schedule can improve their happiness </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> potentially </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-ways-to-boost-summertime-employee-productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase their productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your business, you could offer extended working hours throughout the day to accommodate differences in schedules, take individual preferences into account when assigning shifts, or give your employees the option to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employees-love-working-remotely-is-it-good-for-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work remotely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one or two days a week. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Expand your employee wellness resources</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting your employees’ health is a long-term investment in your business’s success. Seventy-nine percent of employees surveyed in Perkbox’s 2020 workplace stress report said they </span><a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/just-1-never-experience-work-related-stress-finds-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly deal with work-related stress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And it’s only gotten worse over the past year. Sixty-seven percent of employees surveyed said they’re </span><a href="https://www.metlife.com/content/dam/metlifecom/us/ebts/pdf/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more stressed now than before the pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the MetLife Employee Benefits Trends Study 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing comprehensive health coverage, consider what else you can do to support your employees’ overall wellbeing. Maybe you could offer your employees a monthly health and wellness stipend to use on virtual fitness classes, workout equipment, therapy, books, or spa treatments. Or maybe you can partner with another company to offer discounted or free yoga classes or guided meditations to your employees. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Provide regular feedback</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving your employees regular feedback on their work can help them stay engaged and accountable. Without consistent feedback or guidance, they might feel lost, overwhelmed, or undervalued at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to delivering feedback during annual performance reviews, start scheduling weekly or monthly one-on-one </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-tips-run-great-meeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meetings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to check in with your employees, praise them for their excellent work, and offer suggestions or guidance for what they can improve upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to share feedback as it comes up organically. If an employee gives a good presentation, for example, or takes exceptional care of a customer, take the time to acknowledge their efforts in the moment. On the other hand, if an employee botches a client call or shows up late to a shift, you may want to pull them aside right away for a chat. Just make sure you deliver your constructive criticism with discretion and compassion.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Offer childcare help or family assistance </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing your employees you appreciate them isn’t just about praising them at work—it’s also about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-to-put-your-employees-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making their personal lives easier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more enjoyable. One of the best ways to do that is by offering family assistance. Giving your employees the tools to better support their loved ones can reduce their stress and help them stay engaged at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the MetLife study, 69% of employees surveyed said they would appreciate the option to have subsidized care for their family. That could be help with childcare, pet care, or in-home care for ill or disabled family members. Sit down with your HR director to review your company’s health insurance package and see where you could offer assistance, whether it’s a stipend for daycare or paid leave for family care. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Enhance your extras</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/awesome-employee-perks-to-consider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work perks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and exciting benefits can go a long way toward making your employees feel supported, especially </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/management-during-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even small gestures of thoughtfulness can make employees feel seen and valued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your employees work from home, you could send them care packages for holidays or give them gift cards to order groceries or buy take-out meals. You could also offer entertainment stipends, paid lunches, productivity supplies, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee appreciation gifts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like reusable water bottles and cozy blankets. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Support personal development and growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to show your employees appreciation is to invest in their personal and professional growth. Sixty-five percent of employees surveyed in the MetLife study said they’re interested in professional development reimbursements as a work benefit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an employer, it’s a win/win. When you support your employees in achieving their goals, not only do you make them happy, you also reap the benefits of their growth and skills. To start, consider sponsoring a course or program for your employees. They might want to undergo leadership training or take a class that teaches a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specialized skill</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like coding or copywriting. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appreciation goes far</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/celebrate-employee-appreciation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee appreciation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> translates to company success. Instead of putting your employee appreciation efforts on the back burner, make it a priority to treat your employees to something special and acknowledge their hard work. Your business will be better for it in the long run. </span></p>

<h3><b>First of all, tell us a bit about what you do for Fundbox.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Marlena Stallworth: </strong>I was hired in May, 2019 as an Onboarding Specialist, helping customers to potentially acquire a Fundbox line of credit for their business. These are people who&#8217;ve input their information to the application process but haven&#8217;t completed it. Generally that&#8217;s going to be for one or two reasons: either they&#8217;re uncertain about the product or they want somebody to walk them through the technical questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are some typical questions people have when applying for a line of credit?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes our prospective customers ask themselves, &#8220;Do I even need this?&#8221; They may be concerned about what terms we have to offer and how they would work into their business&#8217;s other ongoing payment cycles. Is this really a good fit? Getting clarity on eligibility requirements is pretty common. Will applying affect their credit score? (It won&#8217;t.) Or, if they&#8217;re looking at how to calculate the interest rate on their own, that part might be a little confusing; that&#8217;s because our loans are for only 12 or 24 weeks, not for 12 months, so APR (annual percentage rate) really doesn&#8217;t represent an accurate reflection of what we offer. </span></p>
<h3><b>What did you learn in your first few months that made you so successful? You&#8217;re now the onboarding team lead.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know, sometimes we&#8217;d make maybe 80 to 100 calls, and to me, when you spread that level of activity across a day, I would beg to question what was the quality of the actual conversation. How well were we really taking the time to help each customer? So the next couple months I really thought about how to develop better strategies—not just in terms of the calls, but for all touch points, like emails and the application itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like some of the questions we were asking were a little too generalized. And so I worked really hard at getting those conversations to be a bit more personable because I was trying really hard to get people to trust us more as agents for them, not just as reps for Fundbox. Credit is a very personal thing. It can be a very emotional process—because it&#8217;s your small business and your money, and sometimes even your employees&#8217; livelihoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started by taking more time on these phone calls. If the average customer phone call was just a few minutes, mine was maybe 12 to 15. Sometimes I would learn about people&#8217;s family members, how many cats they have, how long they&#8217;ve been in business, and what their plans are for the future of the business. It would start to make sense why having a kind of safety net in your back pocket would be good for all the things that matter to you at the core of your heart and your business.</span></p>
<h3><b>How did your background and career path before Fundbox prepare you for what you&#8217;re doing today? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In college I minored in dance, which was my passion since I was three, and I majored in English Education—because I love to communicate with people and tend to get acquainted with people easily. This seemed like the natural course, since I have a lot of educators in my family. But I quickly learned the business aspect of education didn&#8217;t mesh well with me from an emotional standpoint, with all the bureaucracy and different political views within the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So instead, I got into retail as a manager for a long time. It was there that I realized I just really loved people! From a professional standpoint, that kind of led the way for me. Selling things or services to people, whether it&#8217;s a wardrobe or a life insurance plan, is all about figuring out how this is going to benefit them. I&#8217;d think, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get to know you so well, you&#8217;re going to trust me with your life.&#8221; And I never shied away from that concept ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent years in banking, starting back about maybe 12 or 13 years ago. That exposure to investment bankers is what really got me really interested in life insurance. I&#8217;ve maintained my license to solicit life insurance and annuities. I think having those tough, detailed conversations with families about what their needs are, whether business or domestic customers, is where I learned to develop more thorough customer correspondence. People want to work through the process. That human aspect is greatly appreciated by customers. I realized working for smaller banks, this acute attention is rarely seen in larger lending institutions. Smaller firms train their people to get to know you better, and that same level of attention can be seen at Fundbox. </span></p>
<h3><b>What keeps you motivated, working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my manager(s) could tell you, the money is the smallest factor of motivation for me.  I generally use financial metrics to help motivate others. I firmly believe that when you are consistently doing what’s right by the customer, the numbers all fall in place. The process of understanding our customers is motivating in itself.  Employing great listening skills in order to remain keenly aware of why customers choose to work with Fundbox is imperative. Did they find us or were they referred to us? What helped them make that decision? What can we help resolve? How can we help you grow?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions aren’t merely asked for the purpose of completing a checklist. It&#8217;s really about building our relationship with that person and I have always been committed to having the conversation—whether it&#8217;s somebody that&#8217;s a great fit, just a good fit, or not a good fit for us right now. At the end of the conversation, I always hoped prospective customers would feel like they were more educated no matter what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy meeting customers where they are and aligning recommendations based on what they’re trying to achieve. It’s important to build up a natural sensitivity to people where they are in circumstances. Having to flex that muscle has become really important during the pandemic because people are not only just facing the concept of how the pandemic is affecting their business; now it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s affecting their family. Some people just really need to hear that they’re not alone, we&#8217;re here for them and remain very grateful for their continued business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Helping applicants become new customers isn&#8217;t all you do for Fundbox. You&#8217;re also improving awareness, allyship, and corporate culture here by leading an employee resource group. </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several instances of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">injustice against Black people have recently come to the forefront on various social platforms. We know for certain that current racial conditions are not going to improve by one community acting on its own. We know now more than ever that we all need each other to truly see continuous progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the death of George Floyd, the executive and human resources teams approached me and Jordan Eldridge, our Sales Enablement Manager, regarding having an open discussion with the company. It was definitely important to get a real pulse check of our staff’s feelings around racial disparity and inequality. We followed through by leading four segments of discussions in a Round-table forum. This was particularly imperative since we have many employees of different demographics in very different regions of the world, between California, Texas, and Israel. These discussions gave us an opportunity to really gain a respect for the outlook and perspectives of each individual. We need to work as a people, as Americans, not just black, not just white, not just Latin, whomever—we all need to work together to make a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First we started the #Allyship channel on Slack [our internal online message board], which allowed us as employees to have an outlet to exchange information across the board, sharing different perspectives so that everybody could see our experiences and continue to learn from one another. Then we developed the Employee Resource Group, forming three different teams: The Pride group,  the Women at Fundbox, and The Melanin Collective. </span></p>
<h3><b>Tell us about The Melanin Collective group, which you lead at Fundbox.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name,  Melanin Collective, is very important because sharing perspectives across cultural demographics is a pivotal aspect. Black culture is embraced and celebrated by people of all communities. We want to impress upon our members that we are all a “Collective of Melanin”; all humans are of color. Moving forward and progressing from a systemic aspect, we all have to continue to do this together. As a group, The Melanin Collective is working to bring many benefits to Fundbox. We strive to identify and help develop internal leaders within Fundbox in an effort to bridge the gap to see more Black leaders represented in our company. Our efforts will lead to higher retention rates as we continue to educate staff  through internal events, panels and more. In the upcoming season, our staff will be growing tremendously. We are working to recruit underrepresented individuals and develop a diverse pipeline of remarkable talent. </span></p>
<h3><b>What advice do you have for anyone else who&#8217;s considering working at Fundbox?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep an open mind and be flexible because even after 8 years, there is still a lot of the startup feel. Change is sometimes the highest constant, especially this year. You should be comfortable with maybe wearing more than one hat at the same time on any given day. I think that that will lead people to a lot of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, be yourself. I particularly love Fundbox because I get to bring myself. I not only get to be my true self, my unique personality is genuinely appreciated here. I think that&#8217;s the one thing that really stands out if I compare my career experiences. I feel that what is so appreciated about my skill set has a lot to do with my soft skills and integrity, not merely the book-sense and credentials that I brought to the job. </span></p>

The primary earnings of approximately 15 million Americans now comes from freelancing and it’s </span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FreshBooks-Finance-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">predicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 27 million Americans would join that number in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as workers transition from employment to freelance life, they face many challenges – key among them is cash flow. </span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FreshBooks-Finance-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that 35% of freelancers struggle significantly with money and 25% of freelance businesses under two years old regularly face cash flow challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key issue for freelancers is that many of the tactics available to other small businesses to improve cash flow – such as raising prices or moving inventory – don’t work for them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a freelancer, here are six strategies that you can practice to improve and manage your cash flow.</span></p>
<h2>Use your contracts wisely</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first tool in your arsenal is your client contract. Whether you have your own contract or are asked to agree to your client’s contract – pay attention to the language and terms. If you have a problem with anything, such as how frequently you can invoice and payment terms, speak up. Now is when you have the most leverage. Your client is eager to start the project and may be willing to make some tweaks to accommodate your demands. You may also want to build in other items such as kill fees, late fees, milestone payments, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill is to avoid any ambiguity in the contract so that both parties are clear about what’s expected and what should happen if the contract is cancelled, you are paid late, or scope creep is introduced to the engagement.</span></p>
<h2>Practice invoice hygiene</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big reason for cash flow woes among freelancers is not getting paid on time. Most clients have payment terms of 30, 45, or even 60-days. In addition, many clients still pay by check which can easily add another week to the process. A </span><a href="https://www.bill.com/about-us/press-release/billcom-survey-reveals-gig-economy-workers-prefer-clients-use-digital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Bill.com found that 54% of freelancers say it takes too long to get their money and 45% say clients don’t pay them on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help mitigate the risk of late payments, invoice promptly and accurately. If you can, don’t wait until the end of the month. Either bill your clients once the project is complete or invoice twice monthly (if your contract permits it). Always include as much detail as you can on your invoice so that there’s no push back or delays. Detail the hours you worked, your hourly rate, a PO number if issued, project specifics, and your client point of contact so that accounts payable knows who to turn to for approvals. Most importantly, include your payment terms. This will give you extra leverage to chase late payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, keep a spreadsheet showing all submitted invoices. Record the date, invoice number, client, amount, and project specifics and if payment has been received. Check your spreadsheet regularly and chase any amounts that are past due.</span></p>
<h2>Set money aside for your estimated taxes</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimated taxes are paid quarterly to the federal and state government. Yet many new freelancers aren’t aware that they are required to make these payments as they go and are caught with a hefty tax bill at the end of the year. Even seasoned freelancers can get caught out if they don’t plan for those quarterly payments and find themselves with an unexpected cash flow crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most efficient way to avoid both scenarios is to save as you go. Instead of pocketing your earnings and spending it all, consider opening a separate bank account and depositing 30-35% of your revenue each month or on a schedule that works for you. You can then draw on this cash to pay your estimated taxes without feeling the pinch.</span></p>
<h2>Consider forming an S Corporation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most freelancers operate as sole proprietorships, and, while the administrative burden may be minimal, the tax obligation can be significant. Sole proprietors pay 100% of their self-employment taxes and are taxed on all profits of the business, less deductible expenses – this can put a huge strain on your cash resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forming your business as a limited liability company (LLC) and </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electing to become an S corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the eyes of the IRS could help you realize savings. When structured as an S corporation, as the business owner, you are treated as an employee and draw a salary from the profits of your business. In this scenario, only your wages are subject to self-employment tax. The remaining profits are then distributed to you as dividends on which you pay personal income tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An S corporation is not right for every freelancer. It all really depends on your income level, the tax bracket you occupy, and willingness to deal with the additional paperwork and state fees. You may also need to retain the services of a tax advisor or accountant to help you meet all your administrative responsibilities. Talk to a pro before you make the leap.     </span></p>
<h2>Reduce your tax burden with an SEP retirement plan</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to reduce your taxable income, preserve cash, and plan for your future is to open a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plan or SEP-IRA. Unlike a traditional IRA, a SEP lets you contribute more to the plan each year – up to 25% of your total income or $57,000 (refer to the IRS for the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-seps-contributions#:~:text=How%20much%20can%20I%20contribute,living%20adjustments%20for%20later%20years)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest contribution limits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Compare that to the current IRA limit of $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great benefit of a SEP is that you can vary your contributions for the tax year up until tax-day. If you have a profitable month, go ahead and put more money into your SEP (as long as you don’t go over the limit). Plus, all those contributions are tax deductible – potentially helping your cash flow situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A SEP is first and foremost a retirement strategy but it’s also a great fit for freelancers concerned about cash on hand.</span></p>
<h2>Use a line of credit as your safety net</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every freelancer needs a safety net. But if you don’t have enough savings to tide you over when cash flow is tight, consider applying for a business line of credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a useful tool that can help freelancers overcome cash flow gaps without the complications that come with a more traditional bank loan. You can borrow a pre-agreed amount of money from a financial institution when you need it and repay back when you don’t. For example, with </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fundbox</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> you can apply online</strong> and get a decision in minutes. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there’s no impact to your credit score just for applying.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also don’t have to use the money right away you can simply have the line of credit on hand as a safety net for when unexpected cash flow issues arise. Unlike a business loan you can also use the funds for any purpose – paying bills, marketing, and so on. </span></p>
<h2>Always have an eye on cash flow</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re busy, you wear many hats, clients are asking for more and more – but remember cash is king. Don’t wait until the tough times arrive to start worrying about cash flow. With careful planning you can offset the common cash flow pitfalls of being a freelancer and be more comfortable and successful for it. </span></p>
