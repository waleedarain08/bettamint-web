Despite intermittent fluctuations in the market, trucking services are consistently in demand, and as such the industry is highly competitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the trucking industry generates one of the largest revenue streams in the U.S. and is responsible for transporting 70 percent of all goods. According to the </span><a href="http://www.nastc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Small Trucking Companies (NASTC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only 15 percent of newly formed trucking companies will survive beyond their second year of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics and high costs associated with owning and operating a trucking business can make it seem very challenging to succeed; however, if managed well, it can be an extremely lucrative business. It isn’t easy to establish and maintain a trucking business. Rising costs, strict regulations, fluctuating markets, and fierce competition are a few examples of the obstacles that can hinder profitability for a small trucking business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trucking may be a costly business, trucking business loans can be an excellent source of funding to help you overcome cash flow gaps or take advantage of an opportunity to grow your fleet. Finding funding for your trucking business can feel overwhelming, but there are several options available. In this blog, we’ll explore the world of financing for trucking businesses and examine some of the key types of loans as well as their benefits.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trucking business loans to consider</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) trucking loans  </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA is not a lender but instead provides funding through participating banks and credit unions. SBA loans offer trucking and transportation companies that may be unable to get a traditional loan the ability to secure bank-rate financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA Loan Guarantee Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help to qualify a borrower who otherwise may not meet the rigid requirements of traditional lenders. If your trucking business has been operating for a while and your personal credit score is above average (690–850), this may be an option for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business line of credit </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trucking is a cash-flow-intensive business. Shippers and brokers can sometimes take 15 to 45 days to pay invoices and this payment delay can create a cash flow gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a business line of credit may provide you with the capital you need to invest in a new or used truck, cover the occasional cash flow gap, or even help you pay for unforeseen expenses like a repair, should you need it. If your trucking business is newer or has not established business credit, it will be challenging to get approved for a line of credit from a traditional lender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, if you’ve been in business for upwards of six months and have a FICO score of 600+, you may want to look into a business line of credit from an online lender like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Online lenders can provide similar financing options to banks, including term loans and business lines of credit, with significantly streamlined application and approval processes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several online lenders that offer short-term loans to small businesses, and that includes trucking companies. A term loan may be a great financing option for a trucking business that requires quick access to a higher amount of cash that’s paid out with a one-time lump-sum payout. For instance, a trucking business needing swift access to cash to help bridge a cash flow gap or take advantage of a time-sensitive business opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, with this type of loan you both borrow and repay the amount within a short period of time. Terms vary from lender to lender, but the term of these loans usually ranges from six months (or slightly less) to three years. This often results in a lower cost of borrowing than a long-term loan. An additional perk of these loans is that they are usually more flexible with the use of funds. Therefore, a term loan can be great for helping your business get through a challenging period, recover from an emergency, or expand your services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset-based financing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have limited credit history or </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/small-business/startup-business-loans-bad-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a low credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, asset-based financing options like equipment financing or invoice factoring may be more accessible to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-does-equipment-financing-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you could potentially finance the purchase of a new truck, trailer, or other physical asset you need to operate or expand your trucking business. In this case, the equipment itself acts as collateral for the loan — similar to a mortgage. What this means is that in the event you are unable to repay your debt, the lender may repossess the equipment you&#8217;ve procured and use it to cover its losses. This type of financing enables you to spread out the cost of purchasing or leasing expensive equipment into manageable payments over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may also be leasing or rent-to-own financing options you can leverage; however, the cost of leasing may be more expensive than a loan due to higher interest rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if you’re seeking funding to cover a gap in working capital, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (another type of asset-based financing), may be a good fit. Invoice factoring enables you to sell your outstanding invoices to a third party, who in turn provides your business with a sum of cash equal to a portion of the invoice amounts.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the modern demands of transportation, small trucking companies are more valuable than ever. However, like all small businesses, it can be extremely challenging to build, maintain, and grow a successful trucking business. It often takes a mix of competitive drive, hard work, business acumen, and a steep financial investment to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trucking business loans may be able to offer the funding you need to maintain, improve, or expand your trucking company. And, fortunately, there are plenty of funding options for trucking and transportation companies to choose from — even those with minimal credit history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to carefully research, consider, and compare options, so you can determine the right type of trucking loan for your business. Regardless of the type of loan you choose, it’s critical to ensure the funding offers returns that outweigh the cost of borrowing. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="A helicopter landing on a helipad delivering medical supplies" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shutterstock_459726331.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to advances in medicine and technology, the population of elderly people in the United States continues to increase. While there were fewer than 50 million elderly Americans in 2015, it’s expected there will be 70 million of them by 2030, according to census data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth, coupled with the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act and the public’s need for medical care, has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to make some serious cash by building businesses that provide needed healthcare services. This is why more and more entrepreneurs are starting medical transportation companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In large part, these non-emergency transportation companies take elderly and disabled patients from their homes to routine appointments and checkups, then back again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients who use non-emergency medical transportation companies are usually on stretchers, wheelchair-bound, or rely on walkers or canes to move from place to place. In almost all instances, these folks are simply unable to use traditional transportation services—like taxi cabs or buses—to get from Point A to Point B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they require some sort of assistance, they have two options when it comes to getting to their appointments: call an ambulance and spend a lot of money or use a non-emergency medical transportation company that’s much more affordable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many patients—or at least those in charge of managing their finances—choose the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking about starting a medical transportation company, that’s great news. You’ve figured out that there’s an increasing need for this kind of service which appears likely to continue growing, with no signs of slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it stands now, the </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-american-healthcare-mobility-markets-report-2020-bourgeoning-nemt-market-is-expected-to-cross-15-billion-by-2027-due-to-tnc-entry-301218021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-emergency medical transportation sector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to generate $15 billion annually by 2027. How do you get the biggest slice of that pie?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I start a profitable senior transportation business?</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Make sure you have enough money</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you might be asking yourself this question: How much does it cost to start a medical transportation company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of the associated </span><a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/MedicalTransportationProviderApplicationInformation.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory start-up costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can take hundreds of thousands of dollars to start your own non-emergency medical transportation company. You need to register your business; cover legal, insurance, permit, and licensing fees; acquire a facility; purchase vehicles; pay utility bills and wage expenses; launch a website; and cover other costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you move forward any further, make sure you have enough money to launch the business. If not, you may have to sell some equity in your business to an investor, apply for a small business loan, or obtain a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Pick the right location</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because everyone needs healthcare services, you can also open a profitable business in practically any part of the country. That said, you still want to do your due diligence ahead of time to figure out whether it makes sense to open in specific markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if there are a lot of non-emergency medical transportation companies in a small city, you may want to open up shop somewhere that doesn’t have as much competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for locations that have dialysis centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other senior assisted-living facilities nearby. That’s where you’ll get most of your revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget that some students need non-emergency medical transportation, too. You may also be able to secure contracts through local school districts.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Take care of legal and insurance aspects</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’d be surprised at how many people forget to tackle the fine print when they’re launching a business. First things first: you may want to incorporate your medical transport company to start things off. Incorporating can ensure you won’t lose your personal assets in the event you get sued, and should be something you consider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also need to figure out which kind of driver’s license you need to take people from one location to another, which varies on a state-by-state basis. Additionally, you’ll need general liability insurance, car insurance, and worker’s compensation insurance in the event one of your employees is injured on the job.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Figure out how to market your business</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re all set up, it’s time to go out and land your first clients and start </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-5-step-blueprint-to-growing-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing your small business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do some research to find out how much your competitors charge their customers and price your services with that in mind. Next, you’ll want to send out some marketing information to prospective customers to let them know that you’re open for business. Offering  discounts is a great way to encourage people to give you a shot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also want to maintain an SEO-friendly blog that covers relevant industry trends and helpful tips your customers will appreciate. Use social media to promote those posts. That way, when people are looking for a company that offers your services, they’ll find you. You may also want to see if you can form partnerships with hospitals, nursing homes, and other similar facilities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Make sure you can collect payments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business needs the ability to collect payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the non-emergency medical transportation industry, you will generally deal with two types of payments: those that come from the patients (or the people who manage their finances) and those that come from the government. In some instances, it may make sense for you to install a device that enables you to collect credit card payments in your vehicle, similar to what many taxis have. In other instances, it might not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid payments will most likely be a major portion of your total receipts. The laws vary from county to county, so make sure you’re familiar with the ones that affect your business before launching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the Medicaid patients, some clients will be able to pay bills by themselves either by writing checks or paying with cash on the spot. In other instances, you’ll have to bill their guardians, who are responsible for managing their finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that you may have to wait a while before collecting the second type of payments. If you run into cash flow problems while waiting for checks to come in, you can use an invoice financing service like Fundbox to advance payments on outstanding invoices.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Hire employees as your business grows</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you get more patients and land bigger contracts, you’ll need to hire enough drivers, coordinators, and support staff to handle the higher volume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure your patients get the quality of service they’re looking for, do your best to hire the best and brightest experienced workers you can find. Assuming you’re the CEO, you’ll need to hire drivers and an office manager. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on how big your company gets, you may also need to hire a dedicated marketing team, a finance department, and a human resources manager.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Stay on top of changing laws</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of this writing, the ACA is the law of the land. To ensure your company never runs afoul of the law, it is imperative that you stay informed about any new regulations coming down the pike that may affect your business. You will also want to stay abreast of potential changes to tax laws that impact your company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to start your medical transportation company?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other business, starting a medical transportation company is hard work. As long as you know that from the outset and are willing to put in the time and energy necessary to succeed, your business is off to a great start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only can starting a medical transportation company generate a lot of revenue and create a lot of jobs, you’ll also be providing a critical service to a number of elderly and disabled patients—helping them and their loved ones enjoy a better quality of life. In many ways, it’s the best of both worlds.</span></p>

<p>It’s difficult enough to grow a business when you’re able to sell to customers for 12 months out of the year. Take away four, six, or eight months and it becomes that much harder.</p>
<p>Still, with the right management strategy, seasonable food businesses can be quite profitable.</p>
<p>While food trucks, for example, might have lacked great reputations a decade or two ago, there’s a renaissance going on in this space. According to one study, U.S. food trucks collectively brought in $856.7 million in revenue in 2015. Fast forward to 2020, and it’s expected that same group <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/444924/industry-value-us-food-trucks/">will haul in $1 billion</a>—a significant increase in five short years.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/05/daily-chart-3">the food truck business is growing</a>—particularly in places like Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City, and Austin, Texas, where local governments have incentivized these kinds of companies.</p>
<p>Despite the positive momentum food trucks are experiencing these days, cash flow problems can severely impact owners of these kinds of companies—just like all other small businesses. When you’re trying to sell as much food as you can during a small window of time, you’ll need cash on hand. Without it, you’ll have a hard time paying your staff, covering insurance costs, buying food ingredients and drinks, and paying for the maintenance of the food truck itself—as well as the gas that powers it.</p>
<p>Starting a food truck business is a pricey endeavor. The <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-start-a-food-truck-business-2888645">truck itself</a> may cost upwards of $100,000, assuming you buy a new one. A used food truck should cost somewhere in the ballpark of $40,000. You’ll also need inventory and supplies, which can set you back up to $2,000. A point-of-sale system might cost another $1,000, and you’ll need to shell out an extra $2,000 for kitchenware, cooking supplies, and other similar items. Of course, you’ll need a fire extinguisher, which might cost $300. There are so many other costs to consider—like uniforms, marketing expenses, and payroll, among other things.</p>
<p>Just when you think you’ve wrapped your head around every food truck expense, you find more. For example, <a href="https://thebolditalic.com/a-closer-look-at-sfs-food-truck-industry-69a56055dc05">food truck operators</a> in San Francisco need to complete 32 procedures to obtain at least 11 permits to comply with the city’s codes—at a cost of nearly $3,500. Food truck drivers in Boston have it much worse; one <a href="https://www.foodtrucknation.us/wp-content/themes/food-truck-nation/Food-Truck-Nation-Full-Report.pdf">study</a> found that it costs $38,000 to run a food truck business there each year.</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is start a food truck business, dig yourself into a hole that big, and then keep digging even further due to the wrong approach to cash flow management.</p>
<p>To grow your food truck or seasonal restaurant business, it is essential that you have a well-considered <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/">cash flow management strategy</a> ready from the outset. Here’s how to do that.</p>
<h2>1. Make sure you have enough cash to start out with</h2>
<p>It’s one thing to have just enough money to start a seasonal food business or a food truck. If you want to run your business without excessive amounts of stress right from the beginning, you need to have at least a little bit of runway so you are guaranteed to be able to float your business for a few months—if not a year or longer—while you’re just starting out.</p>
<p>The last thing you want to do is take out a $100,000 loan, for example, only to find yourself broke and in debt two months later. With enough cash and the right <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/">financial tools</a> in place, you’ll be able to absorb unforeseen startup expenses and continue growing your business.</p>
<h2>2. Keep an eye on your budget and forecast your cash flow regularly</h2>
<p>Prior to opening your doors for business, you should have some idea of how much revenue you’ll take in (at least a ballpark figure) as well as how much your expenses will be.</p>
<p>Before serving your first customers, create a budget and forecast your cash flow. That way, you should have a good idea of whether you’re on track to meet your goals after a few weeks.</p>
<p>Get into the habit of forecasting your cash flow on a monthly basis—or at least a quarterly basis—to make sure you’re never blindsided by a cash gap. In the event a cash shortage may loom in your future, you will have enough time to make contingency plans.</p>
<h2>3. Shop around to make sure you get the best prices on your ingredients and supplies</h2>
<p>Are you getting the best deals on the food, ingredients, drinks, and supplies you need to run your seasonal food business? Do you even know?</p>
<p>Do your due diligence to make sure you’re getting the best prices possible on the ingredients and materials your business relies on. The better the deals you get, the stronger your margins will be.</p>
<h2>4. Think about delaying paying vendors if you can</h2>
<p>Is one of your vendors giving you 30 or 60 days to pay your bill? Consider taking your time to pay. There’s no sense in settling your account until you have to—especially when cash is tight.</p>
<p>If you have some buffer in the form of net payment terms, wait until bills are due to send checks in. You might also talk with your vendors and suppliers to see whether they are willing to extend your credit so you can delay payment even further (e.g., 90 days).</p>
<h2>5. Make it as easy as possible for your customers to pay</h2>
<p>For the sake of their own convenience and margins, some food truck and seasonal food business owners only allow their customers to pay in cash. It’s understandable, to a degree. By only accepting cash, they don’t have to worry about forking over a percentage of their sales to credit card companies or having to figure out what to do to process credit card transactions in the first place.</p>
<p>By some estimates, however, as much as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-restaurant-sales-in-USA-are-cash-versus-credit-card">80 percent of all restaurant sales</a> are charged on credit cards. If you don’t have the ability to process credit cards, you will almost certainly miss out on a significant amount of sales.</p>
<p>The good news is that (thanks to services like Square, Poynt, and Stripe) processing credit card transactions is easier than ever, even for food truck businesses.</p>
<h2>6. Familiarize yourself with financing options</h2>
<p>From time to time, many small business owners run into cash shortages and need to look to outside sources of financing. In fact, over the last five years, 53 percent of small businesses have applied for at least one kind of loan or <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/">credit line</a>, according to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283784">Entrepreneur</a>.</p>
<p>To make sure you don’t suddenly run out of cash without knowing what to do next, research the various financial vehicles that are available to you. That way, in the event you’re forced to look for financing, you’ll already know your options.</p>
<p>If, for example, your food truck business recently catered a few events and is waiting on a couple of customers to settle their accounts, you may want to use an invoice financing firm like <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/">Fundbox</a> to advance payments on those invoices. If approved, you’ll get quick access to the money you’re owed and you can invest it however you need to grow your business. Depending on the option you choose, you would then have 12 or 24 weeks to repay that advance, plus a <a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/">small fee</a>.</p>
<h2>7. Raise your prices or find out how you can add more value</h2>
<p>While you might hesitate to raise your prices ever, after a few successful seasons, you may have no choice—particularly if food prices, gasoline, taxes, or other expenses shoot up. Not sure whether raising your prices is the right move or not sure how to do it? <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-signs-that-its-time-to-raise-your-prices-and-3-ways-to-do-it/">Check this out</a>.</p>
<p>If you are completely against increasing your prices without making any changes to your operations, you can figure out ways to add more value if it makes you less anxious. For example, you can start sourcing your ingredients locally instead of getting them from national vendors. Your customers may not mind forking over a little more cash if it will support local farmers or their communities.</p>
<h2>8. Figure out your slowest sales period</h2>
<p>Once you’ve wrapped up your first season, you should have a pretty good idea about when your busiest season is most likely to be next year—as well as which periods are likely to be the slowest.</p>
<p>Armed with that knowledge, you can take proactive steps to adjust your cash flow management strategy moving forward. As a result, you should be able to keep your cash reserves high during the slower periods—giving you the money you need to cover your costs and invest in growing your business.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to eat.</p>
<p>While food trucks and seasonal food businesses may be a bit tricky to get off the ground because you’re working with less time compared to typical restaurants, it’s certainly not impossible to turn a cool idea and a solid menu into a massively successful business.</p>

By 2020, that number is expected to flirt with $1 billion as food trucks <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/05/04/americas-food-truck-industry-is-growing-rapidly-despite-roadblocks">increasingly open up shop</a></span> all over the country—in places like Portland, Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, and everywhere in between.</p>

The nature of the food truck business was exciting to me. It was a low barrier to entry in terms of the starting capital I needed.”</p>
<p>Oh. There was one other thing, too.</p>
<p>“I didn’t particularly love my old career as a lawyer,” Silverstein adds with a laugh.</p>

<h2><a id="Businessplan"></a>How to create a food truck business plan</h2>
<p>So you want to open a food truck business. That’s awesome.</p>
<p>But you need more than an idea.</p>
<p>“You want to make sure you have a solid business plan and a deep understanding of your local market and laws before you pursue funding for your truck,” says Amber van Moessner, senior director of communications for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://upserve.com/">Upserve</a></span>, makers of a modern restaurant management platform.</p>
<p>Here’s what your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/write-a-food-truck-business-plan-4066702">business plan</a></span> should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <span style="font-weight: bold;">executive summary</span> that explains what you’re trying to accomplish</li>
<li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">company description</span> that includes what kind of food you’re going to sell, where you’re going to operate, what equipment you need, how many trucks you’ll have, and other similar items</li>
<li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">market analysis</span> that examines potential customers, competitors, and what you bring to the table that’s different</li>
<li>A summary of <span style="font-weight: bold;">management and ownership </span>that explains who’s involved in the business and how your food truck operation is going to be run</li>
<li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">marketing strategy </span>that describes how you plan to promote your business (more on that later)</li>
<li>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">business operation </span>plan that includes your hours of operation, the number of employees you’ll have and—if you’ve gotten that far—how much you’re going to charge</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to a business plan, you’ll also have to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://mobile-cuisine.com/business/food-truck-licenses-permits-required/">secure</a></span> a food truck business license, a food handler’s permit, vehicle permits, health permits, fire safety inspection certifications, and other documentation.</p>
<p>This all might sound like a lot—and maybe it is. No one ever said starting a company was easy.</p>
<p>But if all goes according to plan, a lucrative dream job may be just around the corner.</p>
<p>A recent <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://foodtruckempire.com/news/survey-income/">survey</a></span> asked 300 full-time food truck owners how much income they generate annually. More than 85% of respondents said they bring in over $100,000 in gross income each year. More specifically, 34.08% earn between $100,000 and $149,999, 30.04% earn between $150,000 and $199,999, and 21.52% earn more than $200,000.</p>
<p>With the right plan in place and the determination to reach your goals, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12247" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_414437299.jpg" alt="A crowd and several food trucks" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_414437299.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_414437299-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><a id="Challenges"></a>Understand the challenges of running a food truck business</h2>
<p>Building a small business from the ground up is hard work—regardless of the industry. Like all small business owners, food truck owners have to worry about building a brand, selling high-quality products at good prices, finding good employees and keeping them happy, and making sure customers find the food truck in the first place—and enjoy their experiences every time.</p>
<p>Beyond those common business problems, food truck owners all experience a few other industry-specific issues when they’re just starting out, van Moessner says.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenges are balancing your new business and—hopefully—customer demand with marketing and social media and having the right amount of ingredients, supplies, and customers on a daily basis,” van Moessner explains. Technology, however, can make all of it a lot easier. “Using an inventory tool or POS system with data built in can help you predict what your staffing and supply needs will be.”</p>
<p>It can also be difficult to figure out how much inventory to have on hand at any time and where to store your food items and associated accouterments.</p>
<p>“Food and recipe costing can be really challenging—especially if you’re dealing with more limited food storage than a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant,” van Moessner says.</p>
<p>There are also cash flow issues to consider, particularly since most food trucks are unable to take advantage of the economies of scale that some traditional restaurants enjoy.</p>
<p>“You might not be able to buy your supplies in bulk at lower prices,” she continues. “You also have to consider things like vehicle maintenance and fluctuating fuel costs, insurance, licenses, and permits.”</p>
<p>Permits and licenses <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://thebolditalic.com/a-closer-look-at-sfs-food-truck-industry-69a56055dc05">don’t always come easy</a></span>, either. For example, San Francisco food trucks need to complete at least 32 procedures to get proper permits. All told, each food truck needs 11 permits to operate legally in the city—at a cost of nearly $3,500.</p>
<p>Depending on where your food truck operates, you may have a different set of challenges.</p>
<p>According to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.foodtrucknation.us/wp-content/themes/food-truck-nation/Food-Truck-Nation-Full-Report.pdf">recent report</a></span>, San Francisco food truck operators spend $28,642 to run their businesses each year while food truck operators in Portland spend $5,410 to do the same. Boston food truck operators have it the worst, paying nearly $38,000 each year to run their businesses.</p>
<p>Of course, competition can also be challenging. If there are an endless amount of food truck options in the vicinity, it may be hard to break through the market and end up profitable on the other side.</p>
<p>As any small business owner knows, challenges come with the territory. With a solid business plan in place and the right approach to these obstacles, you can build a highly successful food truck business.</p>
<h2><a id="Finance"></a>How to finance a food truck business</h2>
<p>You’re ready to face the challenges food truck operators face and you can’t wait to start serving customers. But you still need to turn your idea into reality—which means you’ll need capital.</p>
<p>Food trucks businesses may be cheaper to start than other businesses, but they still require a good amount of cash. A used food truck can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-start-a-food-truck-business-2888645">cost</a></span> as much as $40,000, while a brand-new one can cost up to $100,000, for example.</p>
<p>There are also many other kinds of costs to consider: vehicle repairs, a POS system, uniforms, supplies, gas, office supplies, a website, inventory, kitchenware, and more.</p>
<p>Some food truck entrepreneurs may have access to that much capital, but most don’t. If you find yourself in the same category as most other food truck owners, there are several financing options to consider.</p>
<p>Silverstein financed The Peached Tortilla by raising $40,000 from investors and funding the rest of the business out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>“The odds of me getting a substantial enough loan to run the business were not good—I had no track record,” Silverstein says. “Banks look at food trucks or restaurants like high-risk loans. I had trouble securing a loan for my restaurant—and that was after I’ve proven myself in the food truck. Why would anyone loan me money for my food truck?”</p>
<p>Other food truck entrepreneurs take different routes.</p>
<p>“Most food truck operators start with a mix of savings, crowdfunding, and microloans,” van Moesser explains. “For some lower-cost operations, getting started is as easy as taking out a low-interest rate business card.”</p>
<p>While it may be tempting to finance your food truck business out of your own pocket, that can create a whole other set of problems—even if you have the cash to spare.</p>
<p>“Self-financing has its pros and cons,” van Moesser continues. “You can start your business debt-free and right away when you are self-financed. But it’s easy to quickly run out of money without a backup plan on the long road to profitability.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/">Crowdfunding</a></span> is another financing option food truck business can consider.</p>
<p>“Crowdfunding is a great idea for food trucks because it also provides a crash course in marketing and a proof of concept before you set up shop,” van Moessner concludes. “If you can get a community excited and bought in on your food truck and products, they will likely support you by purchasing your food once you’re open and established. This also allows you to start your business with minimal debt.”</p>
<p>Still, even with financing in place, cash flow problems can always loom.</p>
<p>“I think what makes the food truck business challenging is the margin, the day-to-day hustle and grind, the amount of stress and energy you have to put in to be successful,” Silverstein says. “If your volume isn’t big enough, you can’t go with vendors that deliver, so then you end up having to go out to a commercial warehouse to buy your products.”</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles, with a solid business plan, financing on hand, and a contingency plan in place if you need more funding, you can grow your food truck business into something much more—as Silverstein’s story demonstrates.</p>
<h2><a id="Find"></a>How to find food truck businesses for sale</h2>
<p>If you dream of running a popular food truck, you don’t <span style="font-style: italic;">have </span>to start your food truck business from scratch. You could always opt to buy one outright, assuming you can find a seller with an existing business you like.</p>
<p>A quick Google search reveals several sites dedicated to selling food trucks to entrepreneurs such as yourself.  But buyer beware: When you take over the business, you inherit everything that comes with it—including the truck.</p>
<p>“There are very few food trucks in the United States that are running out of a vehicle that was built as a food truck,” Silverstein says. “Usually, there’s a truck base or a truck shell that was an old UPS truck or an old FedEx truck and they’ve been retrofitted. The problem with that is that they’re old vehicles, they have a lot of miles on them, and they’re not meant to support the amount and weight of equipment that is on the vehicle itself. You end up having a lot of problems—transmission problems, chassis problems, tire problems, you name it.”</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that old trucks won’t work. Silverstein actually built his own business on the backs of two retrofitted trucks. It can work, and it does work for many successful food truck entrepreneurs. You just need to be careful.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge gamble because you know you’re going to have a lot of problems,” he explains. “You really don’t know how this truck was treated. It’s got a lot of miles, so you know there’s going to be a lot of repairs. It’s just the nature of the business.”</p>

<h2><a id="Equipment"></a>Food truck business equipment and expenses</h2>
<p>As you consider starting your own food truck business, you need to get a good idea of how much it might cost to run or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/truck-loans/">consider a truck loan</a></span>.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, the folks over at Food Truck Empire put together a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://foodtruckempire.com/how-to/costs/">handy list</a></span> of food truck startup costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The food truck itself—fitted with equipment and branding—can cost anywhere between $25,000 and $100,000</li>
<li>Initial inventory costs between $1,000 and $2,000</li>
<li>A point-of-sale system can cost another $1,000</li>
<li>Kitchenware (e.g., pots and pans) can cost up to $2,000</li>
<li>A website can set you back another $5,000 (but you can also build something respectable for less than that)</li>
<li>A fire extinguisher is anywhere between $100 and $300</li>
</ul>
<p>These are far from the only expenses to consider. Permitting and licensing fees (and taxes) all vary on a state-by-state and city-by-city basis—so set up shop accordingly.</p>
<p>You’ll also need a uniform of sorts—some T-shirts and hats might do the trick. And there are office supplies, marketing expenses, fuel costs, insurance, payroll taxes, and other miscellaneous fees to keep in mind as well.</p>
<h2><a id="How"></a>Step by step: How to run a food truck business</h2>
<p>By now, you know what’s involved with starting a food truck business, how much it might cost to get up and running, and the challenges that food truck operators experience.</p>
<p>You’re still stoked on the idea—awesome!</p>
<p>Here are five things to keep in mind as you get ready to serve your first delicious meal.</p>
<h3>1. Choose the right menu and set the right prices.</h3>
<p>If there are 20 food trucks in your city and they’re all serving tacos and burritos, you may want to think twice about opening up yet another truck that sells Mexican food.</p>
<p>Do a bit of research and see what kind of food truck businesses are in your neck of the woods. The more you know about your local market and competition, the better chance you’ll have of standing out. One way to stand out is to come up with a menu that’s unique—something that your city’s missing.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with your menu, it’s time to set prices. You don’t want to charge too much, because you’ll scare customers away. And you don’t want to charge too little, either, because you won’t make any money.</p>
<p>Best practices <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/start-a-business/menu-pricing-methods-for-your-food-truck-business/">suggest</a></span> targeting food-cost percentages between 20–40%. By this logic, if it costs you $3 to make an item, you would consider charging between $8 and $15.</p>
<h3>2. Come up with a catchy name.</h3>
<p>Like any restaurant or dining establishment, the name you give your food truck business can have a tremendous impact on your company’s success.</p>
<p>Spend a lot of time brainstorming potential names. Consider the theme of your menu and the vibe you’re trying to convey. You want customers to be able to tell what kind of food you’re selling with a quick glance. That said, you don’t want to be too restrictive; you never know when you might want to expand your menu in the future, and you don’t want to confine yourself in a corner.</p>
<p>Your food truck’s name should also memorable and easy to pronounce—yet different enough to stand apart from other businesses. If the name is incredibly long, no one will remember it.</p>
<p>Not super confident in your idea? Don’t be afraid to bounce names off of trusted people in your circle for feedback. Your food truck’s name is very important, so you should gather as much data as you can before you make a final decision.</p>
<h3>3. Hire the right people.</h3>
<p>You might create the best business plan in the world and have an even better menu to back it all up. But at the end of the day, there’s only one of you. Unless you’re planning on doing <span style="font-style: italic;">everything </span>on your own, you’ll need a team of dedicated workers to help your business get to the next level.</p>
<p>Choosing who to hire is another incredibly important decision you’ll have to make. While the right employees will help delight your customers, toxic ones will scare them away.</p>
<p>Look for employees who are reliable and friendly. It doesn’t hurt if they are well-connected to the community either, because you can probably bank on some of their friends supporting your business. Great food truck employees will also have a working knowledge of the kitchen and will be able to talk in detail about the meals you serve—what’s in them, whether gluten-free options are available, where the food comes from, whether it’s possible to customize the order, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Because this decision is so important, you should choose your employees very carefully. It’s probably worth working really hard for a few more weeks if it means the difference behind hiring someone you can’t count on and hiring a rock star.</p>
<h3>4. Get your legal affairs in order.</h3>
<p>The geographic area you choose to operate your food truck business out of will determine what you need to do to ensure you’re complying with local laws and regulations. No matter where you wind up, you will have to obtain a food service permit that will need to be renewed on a regular basis (e.g., once a year).</p>
<p>While each jurisdiction’s specific requirements will vary, you’ll generally need to register with the health department to make sure your vehicle is up to code and that your food is stored properly. You’ll also need to make sure that your water supplies are free from contaminants. If you use a commercial kitchen for food prep, inspectors will want to check that out, too.</p>
<p>The health department may also want to see your team in action. To this end, there’s a chance they’ll stop by your food truck unannounced to see whether your staff is wearing gloves and that foods are stored at proper temperatures, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition to passing health inspections, you’ll also need to secure business licenses, obtain an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/how-to-apply-for-an-ein">Employer Identification Number</a></span> for tax purposes, keep your vehicle registered and insured, and pass a fire safety inspection.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll have to familiarize yourself with local ordinances and zoning policies. What hours can you sell food during? Where can you park (in San Francisco, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://thebolditalic.com/a-closer-look-at-sfs-food-truck-industry-69a56055dc05">food trucks</a></span> can’t be within 75 feet of a restaurant)? Are there any limitations on how long you can stay in one location? These are the kinds of questions you’ll have to find answers to.</p>
<h3>5. Embrace your inner entrepreneur.</h3>
<p>Running any kind of business is hard work. Many people underestimate how much is involved in starting any business.</p>
<p>Even if you only serve meals during the lunch window, there are all sorts of other tasks you’ll need to tend to—like processing payroll, ordering supplies, managing your finances, meeting with your team, networking with other businesses in the community, reaching out to media outlets for coverage, and more.</p>
<p>Get ready to work like a machine. If all goes according to plan, you’ll be able to hire more employees and delegate some of these tasks. Investing in modern technology can also help streamline a lot of business-related responsibilities—like managing HR, processing payroll, keeping track of inventory, and even solving cash flow issues.</p>
<p>Now that you have a good idea of what you need to do to run your business, let’s take a look at some ideas on how you can effectively market your business to attract more customers and grow your bottom line.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12248" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_516896896.jpg" alt="People eating at a food truck business" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_516896896.jpg 1000w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shutterstock_516896896-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><a id="Market"></a>How to market a food truck business</h2>
<p>You might be thinking: <span style="font-style: italic;">If you park it, they will come.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s probably not going to be that easy. Sure, you might open up shop and get passersby to give you a whirl. But if you really want to grow your food truck into a successful business, you’ll need to spend some time and money marketing your operation.</p>
<p>Here are six easy ways to do that.</p>
<h3>1. Pay attention to your truck’s design.</h3>
<p>Wherever your truck goes, the eyeballs will follow. Pay close attention to the way you ultimately decide to design your truck and brand it with your logo.</p>
<p>Your food truck itself serves as a mobile advertisement for your business, so you want to make sure it commands attention and is pleasing to the eye. Since your truck is the first thing people will see when they encounter your business, it’s worth going the extra mile to make sure your design is engaging and appealing.</p>
<h3>2. Get more trucks.</h3>
<p>You’ve got awesome branding on your truck. But there’s a problem: Like you, your truck can’t be in two places at once. If business is going well and the market wants more of what you’re selling, you can buy a new truck, give it the same branding, and double your exposure.</p>
<p>If you don’t have enough liquid cash to buy a new truck, don’t sweat it. You can apply for an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/equipments-loan-financing/">equipment loan</a></span> to get the money you need to expand your reach with a new truck—or even a few of them.</p>
<h3>3. Post on social networks.</h3>
<p>Everyone is on social media and everyone likes looking at pictures of delicious food (except when we’re hungry!), so setting up a presence on Instagram is a no-brainer. You probably want to be on Facebook, too, because that’s where all of your customers are. Twitter is another platform to consider. And unless you’re building a food truck empire, you probably don’t need to be on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Grow your social network by offering unique deals and discounts to fans and subscribers who promote your business. What’s more, if your food truck is mobile and not in the same spot every day, your social media fans will be able to easily find out where you are by following your status updates.</p>
<h3>4. Use email marketing to grow your fanbase.</h3>
<p>As you grow your social networks and build up an email list, use email marketing to reach out to your customers every now and again, letting them know about new offerings, special deals, and any events coming up that your food truck is participating in (e.g., a music festival).</p>
<p>Tools like Mailchimp can automate many of these tasks, so you won’t have to worry about staring at a computer all day and can instead focus on what you do best: serving your customers.</p>
<h3>5. Cater private parties and community and business events.</h3>
<p>People are increasingly hiring food trucks to cater all kinds of events: corporate outings, weddings, birthday parties, baby showers, graduation parties, and more.</p>
<p>Not only do these types of opportunities give you a chance to generate more revenue, they also present great marketing opportunities. Stack a pile of buy-one-get-one-half-off coupons on your counter and let guests that are interested grab one at their leisure.</p>
<h3>6. Encourage word-of-mouth advertising.</h3>
<p>More than 80% of customers seek <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.business2community.com/marketing/numbers-dont-lie-2016-nielsen-study-revealed-referrals-01477256">recommendations</a></span> before making buying decisions. This is why word-of-mouth advertising is incredibly effective.</p>
<p>You can’t force customers to advertise on your behalf. But you can take proactive steps to ensure they have great experiences—increasing the chances they do.</p>
<p>Be friendly, be prompt, and be courteous. Serve up great experiences to your customers on a regular basis, couple that with great food, and it’s only a matter of time before patrons recommend your food truck to their friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>You’ve built a great food truck business and—thanks to your marketing efforts—you’ve grown your revenue considerably. Now it’s time to expand your food truck business to get to the next level.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll explore exactly how you can do that.</p>

<h2>How to expand your food truck business</h2>
<p>Some entrepreneurs might be content having a single successful food truck.</p>
<p>Others have bigger ambitions.</p>
<p>Case in point? Akash Kapoor grew his <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.curryupnow.com/">Curry Up Now</a></span> food truck business into an empire that now includes four food trucks, six restaurants, and two cocktail bars. Franchising is also in the works, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://upserve.com/restaurant-insider/turned-one-food-truck-culinary-empire-thats-still-growing/">Kapoor says</a></span>.</p>
<p>As Curry Up Now demonstrates, it’s definitely possible to grow your food truck business into something much larger. It just might not be smooth sailing the entire time.</p>
<p>After Silverstein launched The Peached Tortilla, he truly understood how difficult the food truck business actually was. Eventually, he realized that—instead of driving around from spot to spot or parking in one location—a different path forward made more sense.</p>
<p>“We ended up turning to private events and kind of became this very food-truck-based catering company initially,” Silverstein continues.</p>
<p>That decision opened the door for more opportunities. After Silverstein proved his Peached Tortilla concept successful, he targeted expansion.</p>
<p>“The margins became a lot better. We became profitable and we were able to reinvest those profits back into the business.”</p>
<p>Instead of adding more food trucks to the fleet, Silverstein opted to follow the same route as Kapoor, opening a bona fide restaurant.</p>
<p>Thanks to the success of his food truck, Silverstein had access to the cash he needed to open a brick-and-mortar location.</p>
<p>“Raising money wasn’t too challenging,” Silverstein continues. “I got a line of credit. I put my own money back into the business. I asked my investors to re-up and add more money to the pool and reinvest which they all did.”</p>
<p>It’s unlikely every business owner will have as easy a time securing the capital needed to expand.</p>
<p>If you’re eying the next step in the evolution of your food truck business and need financing, a flexible <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/">line of credit</a></span> is a good option.</p>
<h2><a id="Bestareas"></a>The top 10 areas to run a food truck business</h2>
<p>We all need to eat. That being the case, a food truck located anywhere lots of people are that serves good food at reasonable prices and has a friendly staff has a good chance at doing well.</p>
<p>Some locations, however, have proven to be more lucrative—or at least less of a hassle—than others for food truck entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>According to the experts at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.foodtrucknation.us/wp-content/themes/food-truck-nation/Food-Truck-Nation-Full-Report.pdf">Food Truck Nation</a></span> in collaboration with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, here are the 10 best cities to run a food truck:</p>
