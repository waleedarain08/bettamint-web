										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="477" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus-768x477.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Fundbox plus" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus-768x477.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Fundbox-plus.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right line of credit for your business can be challenging for any business owner. Businesses often need access to funds to operate, and because cash flow gaps are not uncommon, many business owners find themselves without enough working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might need to purchase or upgrade expensive equipment, or you could be waiting on payments from several clients. Situations like these can have a serious impact on cash flow and even threaten the stability of your business. If you have a line of credit in place, however, you can handle these challenges with confidence, knowing you have access to the capital your business needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s essential to gain a clear understanding of the financial implications for your business. To ensure your business gets the most value from the lender and line of credit product, there are a handful of factors you may want to consider.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things to consider when shopping for a line of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan terms are a key consideration when looking for a line of credit. Some companies specialize in longer payback periods, while others require quick repayment. Do you prefer monthly or weekly payments? Do you want to repay over 12, 24, or 52 weeks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, it’s important to think about the product experience and availability of customer support. In what ways will the lender provide support for your business? If you have a question about your line of credit, or if you need to resolve an issue, will you be helped in a timely manner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, a traditional bank was one of your only options for getting access to a line of credit. However, due to advances in financial technology, business owners now have many more when they’re looking for capital. With the help of algorithms, machine learning, and at-your-fingertips technology, online lenders can offer quicker and easier access to capital than traditional lenders — like banks and credit unions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More lending options mean more choice, and when you choose a line of credit product like a Fundbox Line of Credit, you’ll have the option to upgrade to Fundbox Plus, which can provide many additional benefits to your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower Fees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every lender is different, and their differences extend from their application process to their fees, penalties, qualification requirements, and timeline.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you finalize an application, it’s important to compare fees and interest rates to ensure you’re getting the best deal. It’s also important to know if simply applying for a loan will impact your credit score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such fee to consider is a draw fee, which you will incur each time you draw upon the line of credit. The draw fee varies based on the lender, but is usually between 1 and 2 percent of the amount withdrawn at the time. For example, if your line of credit has a draw fee of 2 percent and you draw $10,000, the draw fee would be $200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your funding needs, financial health, and relationship with a lender, it might be in your best interest to opt for a premium tiered line of credit — like Fundbox Plus. For $99/month, Fundbox Plus offers 20 percent lower fees on new draws. So, if you’re planning to use your line of credit multiple times over the course of a year, it might make sense to consider a more premium line of credit option that offers lower fees and additional benefits.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Time to Pay</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A generous grace period before repayment begins can give your business finances a leg up. With Fundbox Plus, you get up to 28 days before your repayment begins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows you to save what would otherwise be the initial payment, and you can use it to cover the cost of other timely, important expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider longer terms with lower payments. By extending your repayment term to 52 weeks, you can benefit from lower weekly  payment amounts, which can help you save money in the long run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer repayment terms can offer you additional flexibility on how you make use of your line of credit. For example, rather than making small, sporadic draws to cover cash flow gaps, you might draw on your line of credit to invest in expensive equipment or other costly business growth initiatives — all at a lower weekly payment amount because you have extended terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your working capital without sacrificing cash flow. Shifting from a weekly repayment schedule to a monthly* repayment option could help you free up cash flow for the rest of the month, enabling you to invest in more time-sensitive expenses like a marketing or advertising campaign for a seasonal sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Payments made once every four weeks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priority Support </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use your business line of credit regularly, it’s a good idea to consider overall product experience and how easily you can access the lender’s support team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of the customer support you receive can be critical to your happiness with your business line of credit. Whether you have a quick question or need more customized assistance, it’s valuable to be able to pick up the phone and get your question answered or problem resolved. Fundbox has invested in its customer support services, creating a highly skilled team that delivers a great experience both over the phone and via email. The support team even won the gold Stevie Award for outstanding customer support in the financial services category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Fundbox Plus, you have access to a dedicated support number and email address, so you’re sure to have your requests prioritized and managed by a highly trained representative.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive Benefits</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-three percent of business owners admit to having felt lonely while running their company, with a third saying that they feel this way consistently, according to</span><a href="https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2017/12/73-of-sme-owners-admit-to-feeling-lonely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new research </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched by Ultimate Finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a business owner can be exciting and satisfying, but it can also be isolating at times. It can be quite challenging for small business owners to find the community or support they need — especially on a tight budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support from a like-minded community of business professionals is an invaluable aspect of running a successful business. With the exclusive benefits afforded by a top-tier line of credit product like Fundbox Plus, you gain access to custom-tailored events, exclusive discounts from our partners, and so much more. </span></p>

Although this ongoing global calamity will eventually become a part of history, it won’t be the last crisis we experience (individually or collectively). That’s why, just as you protect your health by getting a vaccine and wearing a mask, it is important to protect your financial security by learning how to best manage your money throughout a crisis situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These personal finance rules apply to everyone, whether you are gainfully employed, struggling to keep the doors of your small business open amid capacity restrictions and decreased customer traffic, or even</span> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">among the 9.7 million Americans who were unemployed as of March 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are seven money management tips to help see you through the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis, and any other crisis that may come along in the future (and let’s face it, some of this financial advice holds true any time, crisis or not).</span></p>
<h2>1. Stick to your budget (and refine it if necessary)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve heard over and over again that you need to create a budget. And for good reason—when managed properly, a budget works wonders (because it allows you to take control of your money rather than allowing your money to control you). When you are in crisis mode, however, stress and shifting expenses can make it tough to stick to this budget (even if you were great about it before). Resist the urge to let your budgeting practice go during the worst of times. If you do, you could find yourself dealing with yet another financial fallout when the crisis that led you to abandon your tried-and-true budgeting practice finally subsides.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New to budgeting? Just like</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are numerous tools to help you create a budget for your small business</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are also a variety of templates and programs out there to help you figure out how to keep your own budget in check. The best one is relative, but guiding principles include allocating enough money from each paycheck to cover all your fixed monthly expenses (mortgage, utilities, insurance, etc.), figuring how much you need each month to cover groceries, gasoline and incidentals, prioritizing savings and paying off debt.</span></i></p>
<h2>2. Save/plan for big expenditures</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/capital-budgeting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you know you may not want to dip into your working capital to pay for expensive equipment or to fund the construction of a new facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The same theory applies to your personal finances, especially during times of crisis. Yes, it is OK—and perhaps even smart, considering the fact that </span><a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/explore-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interest rates are so low</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—to buy a new house, upgrade your dishwasher or replace an aging vehicle during a time of crisis, but it might not be a good idea to upset your cashflow to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, set aside specific funds to cover the costs in question. Maybe that simply means allocating a certain amount of money each month in a “dishwasher fund” or waiting to buy that new house until you have a larger down payment in hand. Either way, think twice about haphazardly putting what is supposed to be your grocery money toward a payment on a newer/more expensive car.</span></p>
<h2>3. Analyze your expenditures</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because something is in your budget doesn’t mean it has to stay in your budget. Are you actually using all of those apps and streaming services? Do you really need that monthly subscription box? Can you still afford to pay to have your house professionally cleaned twice a month? If the answer is no, press pause on these items. You can always start up again when times aren’t so uncertain.  </span></p>
<h2>4. Seek help</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the nature of the crisis (health, personal, business, etc.), programs exist to help people with their financial obligations during troubling times. Often, all you have to do is ask. Offerings range from the most basic, like food boxes distributed through schools, community organizations and places of worship, to more formal types of aid, like (COVID-19 specific) </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">government assistance programs for small businesses owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also ask your utility companies and other service providers for extensions, or you can </span><a href="https://www.usa.gov/help-with-bills#:~:text=The%20Low%20Income%20Home%20Energy,your%20heating%20or%20cooling%20bills&amp;text=Low%2Dcost%20home%20improvements%2C%20known,and%20lower%20your%20utility%20bills." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for aid if you need it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If it is a medical crisis you are attempting to navigate, ask your provider’s social worker about help as well—many hospitals partner with nonprofit organizations to provide financial support to patients in need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While asking for financial assistance isn’t always easy, it can go a long way toward successful money management during a crisis because help in one category allows you to reallocate funds to a more critical budgetary category if needed.</span></p>
<h2>5. Keep an eye on your credit card spending</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash back rewards are nice, but not if you are paying interest on the purchases that allowed you to earn those rewards. While it is not usually a good idea to use a credit card to pay for things you can’t afford, it is especially problematic during a crisis because the stress of the crisis situation could result in the charges getting out of hand (be sure to pay your bill on time, too, because late payments will eventually impact your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2>6. Be fastidious about how you use your stimulus payments</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can use your check to buy a new TV or to treat your family to a weekend getaway. But before you do that, consider whether that is the best use of the funds. Do you have outstanding debt, or do you need cash to fund your kids’ extracurricular activities? Is your emergency fund non-existent? If so, you might want to consider putting at least a portion of your stimulus toward those practical items so you are not scrambling to cover the costs later.</span></p>
<h2>7. Remember that your emergency fund is there to help you in a crisis situation.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of emergency funds, when you’ve worked hard to put money away in a savings account, it can be distressing to use that money (even when you really need it). However, the whole point of an emergency fund is to carry you through a time of crisis or to cover the cost of an unexpected expense, so you should consider all options available to you.If you’re thinking about dipping into your emergency fund, it may be helpful to plan out how you can rebuild the fund (with at least three- to six-months of living expenses) when your financial outlook improves.</span></p>

To figure out which one will work best for your business, keep reading for a detailed breakdown of the two financing solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a line of credit work? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-line-of-credit-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you access to a revolving credit line, which is money you can use on an ongoing basis. Depending on your business’s credit score and the lender you choose, you could get access to a few thousand dollars or several hundred thousand dollars.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a line of credit, you only pay interest on the money you borrow, and you can access your funds over and over as long as you pay them off. For example, if you use your entire $10,000 line of credit to pay for inventory, you’ll have access to the full $10,000 again as soon as you bring your balance back to zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on lines of credit vary widely; depending on the lender, you could end up paying </span><a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-small-business-loan-interest-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3% APR or closer to 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At Fundbox, we aim to keep our interest rates low, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from 4.66% to 8.99%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you use a line of credit for?  </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit works great for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/ebooks/business-line-credit-work-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short-term funding needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regular operational expenses. You could use a line of credit to pay your office’s utilities, restock supplies, order inventory for your busy season, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountants-hiring-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hire staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or cover unexpected costs </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-disaster-prep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during a crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit is particularly helpful for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridging gaps in cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Let’s say you run a social media marketing agency and need to cover payroll by the end of the week, but payments from your clients won’t come in until the end of the month. That’s where you can dip into your line of credit. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of using a line of credit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can use the funds for a variety of purposes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You only pay interest on the money you borrow, so if you end up needing less cash, you could save money. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher credit limit:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may not even need the extra cash, but knowing it’s available in a crisis can give you peace of mind. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downsides of using a line of credit</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Variable interest rates:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some lines of credit come with variable interest rates—meaning they change with the market—which can make it harder to budget for your payments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Extra fees:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you miss a payment, you could end up paying a hefty fee. Plus, many lines of credit come with monthly maintenance or draw fees, which can add up over time. </span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a business credit card work? </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give you a set amount of credit per month to make non-cash purchases. The credit limit you get approved for depends on your personal credit score and the particular bank or credit union you apply to, but the </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/assets/business-information/infographics/face-of-small-biz.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average business credit card limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is around $50,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to a line of credit, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit loan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to you with a credit card depends on how much you spend and pay off each month. If, for example, you spend $15,000 of your $30,000 credit limit and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bring your balance back to zero, you’ll only have access to the remaining $15,000 the following month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain your business credit card, you have to make a minimum monthly payment, which is either a fixed fee or 1-3% of your total credit card balance. Paying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the minimum monthly payment can give you more cash flow to work with, but it’s also an easy way to rack up debt. For business credit cards, </span><a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/average-credit-card-interest-rate/50841"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average interest rates are around 17%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but if you pay off your full credit card balance each month, you won’t have to pay interest. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you use a business credit card for? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use a business credit card to pay for regular expenses—like utilities or supplies—that you know you can pay off in full each month. Business credit cards also work well for non-cash purchases that don’t require a big chunk of money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine, for example, that you run a parking lot maintenance business. If you need to buy a new power washer but don’t want to dip into your company’s cash flow, you could use a business credit card to buy the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-to-use-equipment-loans-to-improve-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then either pay it off at the end of the month or chip away at the cost over time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of using a business credit card</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use a business credit card for a number of different purchases and expenses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Business credit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards give you the opportunity to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/credit-expert-marco-carbajos-top-lessons-smbs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you pay off your monthly credit card bill in full—and on time—each month. Improving your business credit score can make it easier to get approved for business financing in the future or score more favorable terms. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Rewards:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many business credit cards offer sign-up bonuses, points with purchases, or cash rewards. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drawbacks of using a business credit card</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Potential debt: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you only pay your minimum monthly payment, you could rack up more debt than you intended to and have to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt consolidation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down the line. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Fees: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the credit card, you might have to pay annual maintenance fees.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Based on your personal credit score:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To apply for a business credit card, you have to use your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-mistakes-hurting-your-personal-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have a decent score, you may have to provide collateral to get approved for a card. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business line of credit vs. credit card</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help make your decision, consider the following factors: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your financial needs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How much money do you need and what do you need it for? Would you prefer a flexible amount of cash, or would you rather have access to monthly credit?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your cash flow:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How often do you have gaps in cash flow? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your comfort with debt:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How likely are you to pay off a credit card in full each month?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your goals: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to establish a cash flow </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-line-of-credit-safety-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safety net</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or start a major </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-business-line-credit-can-help-grow-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Do you want to build business credit or earn points and cash back for future business purchases? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a significant amount of cash for business expenses or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-stay-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or if you’re not sure how much money you need, a line of credit could be helpful. Not only are you more likely to get a higher limit with a line of credit, you may also get more affordable interest rates, which makes it easier to repay the money you borrow on a gradual basis instead of all at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you want to earn rewards or if you only need a small amount of money per month—and have the cash to pay it back in full—a business credit card could be a great solution. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to get a business credit card </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can apply for a business credit card through your preferred </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business banking service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a local bank or credit union, or an online bank. Make sure you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do your research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consider your goals before applying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want a low interest rate, look for credit cards that offer 0% APR. If you want perks and points, seek out cards with good cash-back deals and bonuses. Or if you want to build up your business credit, look for a basic business credit card with a low spending limit to keep yourself in check. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to get a business line of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get a business line of credit through a bank or alternative online lender. Every lender will have </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-line-of-credit-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">different term lengths, interest rates, and qualifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for lines of credit, so don’t forget to ask about the specifics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in flexible funding and straightforward pricing, check out Fundbox’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Also called microcredit, microlending has been gaining popularity over the last five years—and for good reason. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is microlending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microlending is the practice of giving small loans—from $25 to a few hundred dollars—to business owners in need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microlending falls under the umbrella of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">microfinance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which refers to any financial help given to people who wouldn’t otherwise benefit from traditional financial institutions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began as a way to help business owners and entrepreneurs who either 1) have no access to funding where they live or 2) can’t get funding from banks because of their lower </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-mistakes-hurting-your-personal-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet and the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending economy—where individuals give each other loans—microlending has become a global phenomenon. Loaning small amounts of money goes especially far in developing nations and impoverished places where aspiring entrepreneurs have little government assistance to start businesses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does microlending work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans work like most other term loans: borrowers get a certain amount of cash upfront that they have to pay back—with interest—over a specific period of time. Unfortunately, interest rates on microloans tend to be high, with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average global interest rate hovering around 35%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s because it’s riskier to lend to entrepreneurs with poor credit; plus, borrowers often don’t put up collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike a bank loan, microloans can come with unique stipulations for the borrower. For instance, many microlenders require borrowers to take an educational workshop or business class before they can receive their funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the majority of traditional financial institutions don’t see the payoff in microlending, most microlending occurs on P2P platforms. However, there are also a handful of dedicated microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as 51Give in Beijing and Grameen Bank and BRAC of Bangladesh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain countries have also developed their own microloan programs. In the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has a microloan program designed to help women, low-income, veteran, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-entrepreneur-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority entrepreneurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get access to working capital, supplies, or equipment. The </span><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41057.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average SBA microloan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is around $14,000 and has a 6.5% interest rate. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of microlending? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microlending can help entrepreneurs from marginalized communities or impoverished areas get their businesses off the ground, which in turn gives struggling individuals and families the chance to earn a better income. In the long term, microlending can help create job opportunities, reduce poverty, and further education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a microloan lender, there’s a small financial incentive in the form of interest, but there’s also a chance that a borrower could default on the loan. For that reason, most lenders spread out their investments to minimize their risk. Instead of contributing $1,000 to one single borrower, for example, a microlender might loan $100 to 10 different borrowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that most microlenders don’t dabble in microfinance for the potential ROI. Rather, the main benefit of microlending is helping a worthy business owner </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-biggest-mistakes-avoid-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launch or develop their company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to know as a borrower: risks and benefits</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a small amount of money for your business and have had a hard time getting help from </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditional financial institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, microlending could be right for you. Its primary appeal is accessibility and ease. If you have a promising business plan and a compelling story, getting a microloan via an MFI or P2P website may be easier than turning to a bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are risks to taking a microloan. Funding isn’t always fast. Depending on your location or your lender’s requirements, you could wait weeks or months before getting your money. Plus, if your business doesn’t take off, you could be stuck paying high interest rates that trap you in a debt spiral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you make a choice, consider the following factors: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your location and access to funding</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your credit score</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much money you need</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit potential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to become a microlender</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways to get started. If you want to earn interest and/or participate in your borrower’s business development, consider a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">P2P lending</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> site like </span><a href="https://www.prosper.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lending Club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also search for lenders using the SBA’s </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/partners/lenders/microloan-program/list-lenders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of local microlending organizations by state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you don’t care about interest or don’t want to be involved in the business’s growth, you can sign up with </span><a href="https://www.kiva.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an MFI that takes a more hands-off approach to giving. You may also want to look into </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crowdfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a funding solution that helps businesses raise money through charitable donations. You won’t get your money back, but you may be eligible for rewards or benefits if you pledge a certain amount of cash to an entrepreneur. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="American soldier flag patch" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not easy for soldiers to leave the battlefield and transition back to civilian life. Many veterans struggle with finding a job where they feel satisfied. Returning to a conventional job can feel challenging: it’s one thing to follow orders to protect the freedom of the nation; it’s another to be told what to do by a manager. Instead, many veterans decide to pursue entrepreneurship to become their own bosses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans play a vital role in the economic stability of the private sector. In fact, </span><a href="https://smallbusiness.com/resources/military-owned-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of businesses in the U.S. are veteran-owned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, like other small business owners, as a veteran, you may struggle with the same challenges that come with launching and running a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="http://veteranbusinesscoalition.org/the-death-and-rebirth-of-veteran-entrepreneurship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coalition for Veteran-Owned Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly 25% of veterans want to start a business; however, a mere 6% actually go through with it. Why? Because the reality is that veterans don’t have enough access to financing and the resources to help them acquire the capital and training they need to start a business successfully. Sadly for the veterans who start their businesses with personal and family savings, it’s often not enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are loans designed specifically for veterans through the Small Business Administration (SBA). There are also other small business loan </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/facts-veterans-and-entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options for veteran entrepreneurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are ideal for start-ups, fast cash, working capital, and financing for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best loans and financing opportunities available for veterans:</span></p>
<h2>1. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA offers several small business financing options reserved for veterans. Here are two examples of veterans-only loans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance/military-reservist-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MREIDL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available to military reservists whose business’s financial goals were unmet because an essential employee was called up to active duty. The loan is a temporary source of financing to cover operating expenses until the reservist is discharged.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SBA Veterans Advantage Program:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The VA loan typically has lower rates and fees compared to traditional loans. Under the</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/Veterans_Advantage_Borrower_Fact_Sheet_FY17_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA veterans advantage program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can get up to $150,000 with no upfront fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Most members of the regular military, National Guard, reservists, and veterans are eligible to apply for a VA loan. Specifically, to qualify for a VA business loan, the business must be 51% owned and controlled by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An honorably discharged veteran</li>
<li>A service-disabled veteran</li>
<li>An active-duty military member participating in the military Transition Assistance Program</li>
<li>A reservist or member of the National Guard</li>
<li>A spouse of any of the above</li>
<li>A widowed spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or from injuries sustained as a result of their service</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Veteran-specific financial groups</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran-specific financial groups aim to make it easier for military members to obtain the funds they need to grow their businesses. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://hiversandstrivers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Hivers and Strivers</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hivers and Strivers is an angel funding firm that funds early-stage companies founded by graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, or Merchant Marine Academy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.streetshares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Streetshares Foundation</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition to short-term loans, the foundation offers monthly grants and loans for veteran-owned businesses (or ones run by their spouses), prioritizing businesses based on their social impact and the strength of their business idea. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bunkerlabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Bunker Labs</b></a><b>: </b>Bunker Labs is a nonprofit organization that provides access to a national network of veteran and milspouse entrepreneurs dedicated to helping veterans and others in their transitioning military community start their own business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Traditional banking institutions</h2>
<p>Traditional financial institutions are options for veterans who have solid credit scores. Unfortunately, over the last several years, banks have signed off on fewer and fewer business loans. In fact, banks only approved 25.3% of the small business loans that came their way in 2018.</p>
<h2>4. Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and AngelList are some of the best crowdfunding sites for small businesses. This option is ideal for veteran entrepreneurs who are building products or creating services. Crowdfunding connects entrepreneurs to donors and investors who believe in the veteran’s project or business idea.</p>
<p><em>Considering crowdfunding? Here are 5 <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pros and cons of crowdfunding your business</a>.</em></p>
<h2>5. Invoice factoring and invoice financing</h2>
<p>Does your business have a lot of unpaid invoices? With invoice factoring, you can sell them at a discount, giving your fast cash and saving you the time you’d spend tracking down your clients to pay up. With this option, you forgo a chunk of your revenues since the invoice factoring company owns your invoices and therefore, collects payments directly from your customers.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting some funds from your accounts receivable, but you would rather maintain control of your relationship with those customers, check out a similar option, called invoice financing.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about how</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differ and what they can offer.</span></i></p>
<h2>6. Business lines of credit</h2>
<p>Unlike other forms of financing, you don’t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you actually use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process for applying and getting a line of credit varies depending on which firm you work with, but the internet and AI technology have combined to dramatically speed it up in recent years. With alternative lenders like </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> that offer business lines of credit</strong>, you can secure credit limits of up to $100,000 that you can repay over 12 or 24 weeks via auto debit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Fundbox, you can apply online without any paperwork to get started, and can expect a credit decision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in as little as 3 minutes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Education and training for  veteran entrepreneurs </span></h2>
<p>There are also amazing organizations and programs that aim to educate and train veterans to become entrepreneurs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://ivmf.syracuse.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF)</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The Syracuse University provides education and training for entrepreneurial veterans. Part of the program aims to educate veterans on how to access capital and finance their business.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/ovbd/resources/160511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boots to Business</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a free 2-step education and training program to service active-duty military members transitioning out of the military and their partners or spouses who want to become entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://patriotbootcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriot Boot Camp</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span>  Patriot Boot Camp is a non-profit boot camp offered to active duty service members, veterans, and their partners or spouses. During the 3-day program, they are educated and trained on the fundamentals of starting a business by mentors.</li>
</ul>

You have many choices, ranging from traditional banks to online fintech providers—including Fundbox, Kabbage, OnDeck, and BlueVine. To help you compare options for a <a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/">business line of credit</a>, this article provides a quick description of the key differences between them. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a business line of credit?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit provides an amount of capital that you can draw against—up to your credit limit—and repay over time. Similar to a credit card, most lines of credit are revolving; this means that as you repay the amount you’ve drawn, your available credit replenishes and you can draw against it again, repeatedly, without having to apply for a brand new loan. This makes a line of credit an attractive option, for once approved, funds can be accessed quickly, so your money is ready when you are. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current with COVID</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article is current as of October, 2020, and the research cited herein reflects the state of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key questions to ask</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering your options for a business line of credit, we recommend you ask yourself the following questions, concerning the provider and what you need:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Is the provider actively lending? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic struck, many lenders suspended accepting new applications, even though their website may have still displayed an active “apply now” button. Before applying, it’s helpful to try and verify if they’re looking for new customers or not. Fundbox never stopped accepting applications from new customers or originating loans to existing customers throughout the pandemic. On the other hand, the economic slowdown has affected all lenders differently. For example, Kabbage stopped</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/17/kabbage-turned-to-doling-out-ppp-loans-to-save-its-lending-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approving new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> very early, in March, 2020.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>How much do you really need? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may seem tempting to ask for as much money as possible, this comes with a risk. If you’re approved for more than you actually need, you might end up facing difficulty repaying whatever you use. You may be able to do more with a smaller amount (and therefore less credit exposure). That’s because, with revolving credit, you can reuse the funds as you repay them and the available credit amount replenishes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How quickly do you need the money? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes new business opportunities arise that require an immediate response; a new client calls with a fast deadline, or an old client has a last-minute request. If that happens, you might want to prioritize a lender with a streamlined application or a fast decision process so you can get an answer and confidently take on the new work if you’re approved.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13789" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png" alt="Comparison matrix chart for business lines of credit, comparing Fundbox, Kabbage, OnDeck, and BlueVine" width="1422" height="558" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png 1422w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM-768x301.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the application process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every lender is different, and that extends to their application process, as well as their requirements and timeline. Before choosing a lender, learn about their processes and the information and qualifications they need from you.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>How much time does the application require? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at each prospective lender’s form and estimate how long it will take you to complete the application. This is especially important if you need a credit decision in a hurry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>What information do they require? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some information you may be asked for includes your company’s federal tax ID. Do you have such information handy? Many applications ask for personal details for each person who owns more than 25% of the business, to verify their identities. Plus, most applications will ask for some way to demonstrate the performance or economic health of your company. For example, they may ask to connect your business bank account or accounting software.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>How can they provide a credit decision? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because the provider’s credit application is available online doesn’t mean they will give you a result in seconds. Sometimes lenders can take hours or even days. Fundbox’s application was optimized to give a fast decision—within minutes, for most customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualification criteria are just the beginning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you meet the eligibility requirements? Every lender has a different minimum criteria for deciding which businesses to extend credit to. You should note that even if you meet the minimum criteria, you won’t necessarily get approved. Many lenders take a number of different factors into consideration when approving customers—the minimum criteria simply being the first filter that applicants must pass through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, while Fundbox has minimum requirements, a “typical” customer of ours exceeds those minimums and has around $300,000 in annual revenue and has been in business for years, not months.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms: the length of your loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While possibly not at the top of each business’s list, loan terms are a key consideration when looking for a line of credit. Some companies specialize in longer payback periods while others ask to pay back quickly. Do you prefer monthly or weekly payments? Do you want to repay in 12, 24, or 52 weeks?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer experience matters</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit is a tool you might be using often, depending on your needs. We recommend you consider the product experience and availability of customer support before making a decision. Some companies have invested in design and have built a streamlined product. Others might lack that attention to user experience (UX). Design can affect the speed to which you can complete an application, draw funds, and even your overall satisfaction with the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, customer support (customer service) can be critical to your happiness with your business line of credit. Imagine if you had a question about the product, or a problem you needed to resolve, but no one would pick up the phone? </span><a href="https://stevieawards.com/sales/fundbox-customer-service-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox won the gold Stevie Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for outstanding customer support in the financial services category, but not all companies have invested in the team and technology needed to deliver a great experience over the phone and email.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer reviews</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While companies themselves can talk about a great experience or the awards they’ve won, a good indicator of the level of service they provide is the reviews their customers have written about them. Sites like Trustpilot or the Better Business Bureau allow customers to post their reviews with comments so you can get a better sense of their real-world experiences and what they like and dislike about the company and its line of credit.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lender’s own stability</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world of economic uncertainty, we thought we should add a section on company stability. If you’re going to apply for a line of credit with a company, you should consider whether or not you think the company will be around for the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few questions to ask yourself as you do your research are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did they handle the pandemic? Did they continue lending?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did they fundraise recently or do they have money in the bank to handle economic fluctuations?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were they acquired by another company?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox was fortunate to raise over $170 million in 2019, and we have kept the vast majority of that money in the bank to protect ourselves from the unexpected. We continued originating new loans throughout the pandemic, and continued taking on new customers during that time as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers reward innovators,” said Dave Munson, the owner and CEO of </span><a href="https://saddlebackleather.com/?SID=a8d78bef759d908f0091c064ced905da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saddleback Leather Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a store that sells high-quality leather goods and accessories. “They like companies that try to improve things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvement, however, often requires financing. According to the </span><a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2019/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Small Business Credit Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of small businesses have sought financing to expand or pursue an opportunity. Extra cash can give you the freedom to generate ideas, experiment with marketing tactics, and take risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding and credit are essential to tapping growth opportunities,” said Ted Chan, the CEO of </span><a href="https://www.caredash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CareDash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online healthcare review directory. “Markets innovate very quickly now—whether it&#8217;s debt or equity, funding can launch a new product or service line to capture fast-moving opportunities.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are particularly flexible. Unlike a term loan, which gives you a lump sum of cash, a line of credit is revolving. You can tap into your funds on an ongoing basis and use them repeatedly as long as you bring your balance back down to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to step up your game? Here are five ways you can use funding to edge out your competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Develop a new product or service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a unique product or service can help you attract new customers and increase revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the best ways to stay competitive in any field is to stay on top of the trends and always put your customer&#8217;s needs and wants first,” said Lydia McConnell, the founder and creative director of </span><a href="https://www.lechicmiami.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Chic Miami</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a shop that sells handmade jewelry. “What would your customers benefit from the most? How can you make the best possible experience for them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For McConnell, that means gathering feedback from customers on their favorite jewelry styles, then experimenting with designs, colors, and concepts. For other businesses, catering to customers’ needs might require conducting market research, adding new features to current products, or investing in a unique platform or offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We used our line of credit to build out our core product, the CareDash healthcare directory,” said Chan. “Staying ahead of the curve on key trends like the consumerization of healthcare, telemedicine, and value-based care is essential to the growth of our business.” </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Improve production and increase output</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can’t compete with larger companies on price, try competing on output. Using </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/use-first-business-loan-effectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to streamline your production process can help you take on more work and grow your business quicker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McConnell used a line of credit to purchase a laser cutting machine for her studio, she was able to process larger orders. “Before, when I was using a laser cutter at a local Makerspace I could only use their machine two hours a day.” Full-time access to such an efficient tool also helped McConnell improve the quality of her products. “It has really allowed me to create complex shapes and more intricate designs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider which areas of your business’s production process are slow or outdated. If, for example, you struggle with organizing inventory or boxing items quickly, you could use a line of credit to purchase inventory management software or buy packaging equipment. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Meet increased demand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not your business operates seasonally, there are certain times of the year when you need to respond to a surge in demand. “We always want to have our most popular things in stock during the big season,” Munson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you cover upfront costs in raw materials, labor, production, and storage. Or, if you run a service-based business you could use a temporary cash infusion to hire seasonal employees or contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use our line of credit in August or September and start producing an extra 10-15% of product each month to prepare for the holidays,” Munson said. “We have to buy a lot of leather and pay for the labor without the sales, but once the sales come in they far outweigh the interest on the line of credit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to have enough resources to cater to customers when demand spikes; businesses that do are more likely to see repeat customers and benefit from referrals. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Invest in marketing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tempting to cut your business’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when cash is tight, but consistent marketing can be critical to expanding your customer base. A line of credit can give you the financial cushion to adopt a new marketing strategy or try a different distribution method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your content marketing consists mostly of articles and blog posts, for example, you may want to explore videos and infographics. Or maybe you want to double-down on strategies with a proven ROI, like email campaigns and social media ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding can also give you the freedom to rethink your approach to finding and retaining customers. Chan said his company employs judo strategy, which involves responding quickly to market changes and adding new features to their products before their competitors can. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then market these features aggressively as differentiating points.”  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Capitalize on growth opportunities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking advantage of growth opportunities can set you up for long-term success, but you need the funds to act fast. A line of credit can provide the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> necessary to acquire a smaller competitor, relocate to a busier side of town, or bid on a large project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Munson, the opportunity came when his clients began asking him to manufacture for them. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to hire people for a few months and pay for their salaries and their training, on top of trying to grow the company and continue with inventory,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the upfront expenses, the work came with long-term benefits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more I can grow the factory, the more it distributes the fixed costs of the factory and makes us more competitive in our pricing,” Munson said.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ahead of the game</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying ahead of the competition is essential to your business’s longevity and financial stability. To see if you can get the funding you need to help gain this competitive edge, apply for a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now. </span></p>

However, using revenue and cash flow alone, he had to wait until reserves increased before he could hire. That’s when he started looking for a <a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=blog_fluxaccounting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit</a>, to get away from this cyclical dilemma. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-13740 alignleft" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ChaseVowellBW.jpg" alt="Chase Vowell of Flux Accounting" width="242" height="363" style="width:242px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an avid QuickBooks user, he looked at the QuickBooks App Store for some ideas. That’s when he found Fundbox. Fundbox integrated into QuickBooks and had good reviews, so he decided to give it a try. “I remember onboarding being really easy. The setup with QuickBooks was seamless,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he was approved and started using Fundbox he was impressed. “The interface is extremely user friendly,” he said. “The sheer transparency is phenomenal, which is rare,” he added. As the leader of an accounting firm, he also cared about the QuickBooks integration. A lot. “I specifically appreciate the way that you can use Fundbox inside of QuickBooks. The integration is really clean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing for Chase and Flux Accounting is the impact that Fundbox has had on his business. “We’re now able to hire much earlier, so by the time we hit a busy period, our employees have already been trained and our clients don’t see a lapse in service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solutions like Fundbox are where Chase sees his practice moving in the future. “This is the future of cloud accounting,” he explained. “Everything ties to the accounting platform and you cut down on the manual work, so you can focus on the value-add consultation with your clients.”</span></p>

It&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated that $3.1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in receivables is owed to U.S. firms on any given day. The problem gets even worse when companies pay late. Improving cash flow is especially important during the COVID-19 economy. This need for quick cash has led many small businesses to consider invoice factoring — selling accounts receivable to an invoice factoring company at a discount, plus a fee. Besides being expensive, invoice factoring comes with other risks to your business. Here&#8217;s how factoring works, and how a line of credit may be a better alternative.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factoring is ancient history</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants and traders have been using a form of factoring since about 1754 B.C.E. (before the common era) in ancient Babylon, as </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hammurabi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out in the Code of Hammurabi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a giant, black stone pillar detailing 282 rules governing commercial interactions, including establishing proper conduct, fines, and even eye-for-an-eye punishments. As early as 2000 years ago, Romans were believed to sell discounted promissory notes and hire third parties to settle their trade debts. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring, as a practice by name, began in England before the year 1400. Pilgrims brought it to America around 1620. </span><a href="https://www.openbusinesscouncil.org/the-history-of-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">English common law required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that if a merchant wanted to sell invoices to a third-party for factoring, the debtor had to be notified. However, that requirement had fallen away by 1949, when most state governments in the U.S. had adopted rules so that merchants could make factoring arrangements without notifying the debtor. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why businesses use factoring</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that factoring has been a common B2B practice for more than 3,700 years means that it has to be good for something, right? Basically, it&#8217;s a way for small businesses to get cash sooner instead of waiting around for their clients to pay on net terms, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay past due</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or not at all. It also frees a company&#8217;s staff from the stress and workload of following up on collections. Understandably, however, this convenience comes at a price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hard and hidden costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring brings several disadvantages to the businesses who use it. It can be much more expensive than other types of funding — taking a large chunk out of your profits — and it may even face you with other issues.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The cost.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The discount rate (or factor rate), depending on the factoring period, could range from 2% to 10% of the invoice. Plus, you may have to pay service fees, origination fees, credit check fees, or other fees added by the factoring company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The customer impression.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies may issue a Notice of Assignment and verify your invoices with the debtor. If this happens, your customers may question the stability of your business, since turning to factoring is often a tell-tale sign of cash flow problems, so they may consider switching to your competitor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The contracts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some factoring companies require long-term contracts, forcing you to sign over a majority of your invoices, rather than just filling a short-term cash crunch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The control over your business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reduce their risk from customers who are likely to default, some factoring companies may even prevent you from working with specific accounts you had previously built relationships with.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better way to maintain cash flow while waiting to get paid</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses have more options than factoring to avoid the cash flow problems of delayed payments, even in situations where you can&#8217;t ask your customers to pay by credit card. A </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business line of credit from Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with the financial breathing room to keep your operations going despite the peaks and valleys of irregular working capital that may come even when facing irregular payment on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">receivables</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Best of all, this comes without your business having to offer a discount on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment, sell your invoices at a loss, or sacrifice your control or reputation with your valuable customers. </span></p>
