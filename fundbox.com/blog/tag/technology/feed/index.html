Going green can save your business money, help streamline operations, and show customers that you’re responsible and forward-thinking.</p>
<p>While a water filter and a recycling bin in the office dining area are helpful, there are other steps that small business owners can take in order to have an even greater impact on the reduction of their carbon footprints. More specifically, recent technological innovations have made it easier than ever for businesses to be more earth-conscious without harming operability.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make your business more environmentally sustainable. Consider these five tips to take active steps toward conserving our planet for future generations.</p>
<h2>1. Use renewable energy</h2>
<p>Flicking a light switch or pressing the power button on a computer may not seem like it’s adding to pollution since those technologies don’t appear to run on fossil fuels. However,  they do have an impact on the environment even if they’re not emitting exhaust fumes.</p>
<p>What can you do about this? Two words: solar panels.</p>
<p>You may have heard that solar panel technology is expensive to install and doesn’t pay itself off in value for many years, but that’s not entirely accurate; installing solar panels is quickly becoming <a href="https://news.energysage.com/how-much-does-the-average-solar-panel-installation-cost-in-the-u-s/">more affordable</a>. The time that it takes to break even is largely dependent on where your business is located.</p>
<p>With the proper maintenance, a solar panel system can be one of the best ways for small businesses to minimize ecological impact while also cutting down on operational costs. According to <a href="https://news.energysage.com/commercial-solar-benefits-for-business/">some marketplace data</a>, business owners may be able to save as much as 80 percent (or even more) on their electric bills by installing solar panels.</p>
<p>Top tip: Don’t let your budget stop you from considering more environmentally sustainable business practices. For smaller businesses, in particular, the price of using eco-friendly technologies like solar panels may seem expensive at first, but may end up helping save you money on energy costs in the long run. Review your costs and figure out your “break even” point. If installing a new energy-saving feature costs a certain amount up front, but your monthly bills go down as a result, how long will it take to pay for itself? Depending on the investment, it may even make sense to finance the initial cost, using a business loan or line of credit.</p>
<h2>2. Go paper-free to reduce waste</h2>
<p>Whenever possible, eco-conscious small business owners are already doing their absolute best to reduce paper use. By now, using email to communicate with employees, clients, and customers is standard protocol.</p>
<p>But that’s just the beginning. There are many ways to apply the paperless principle to every aspect of your enterprise. Conducting communications and paying bills exclusively through digital channels will not only help save trees but will also cut expenses. The associated <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1393497">costs of using paper</a> are estimated at 31 times the purchasing cost, which is $40 on average. That means for every case of copy paper you avoid, you could save around $1,200.</p>
<p>These days, it’s getting easy to avoid using paper. You can keep everyone in your business’s network in the loop with regularly-scheduled email newsletters, updates on your company’s website, and social media posts (just to name a few).</p>
<p>Additionally, there are many online services that you can use to streamline internal operations while doing away with paper at work. For example, <a href="https://monday.com/">Monday</a> and <a href="http://asana.com">Asana</a> are services that allow businesses to schedule assignments, organize projects, and share links, documents, and media with team members. Digital project management tools like this can help eliminate lots of paper from your office while increasing employee productivity.</p>
<h2>3. Work remotely to reduce emissions</h2>
<p>When you hear the term ‘CO2 emissions’, what’s the first image that comes to mind? Your answer might be a strip of highway packed with clouds of fumes billowing out of vehicle tailpipes. While cars are unlikely to disappear anytime soon, there are ways that small businesses can reduce air pollution. One way is to let employees work from home. Even one or two days that an employee doesn’t need to drive to work can make a difference.</p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible innovations made over recent years in digital communication technology (such as video chat) it’s now possible for people to telecommute to work with ease. Besides the ability to have face-to-face meetings with employees as well as clients without being in the same room, online applications such as <a href="https://www.zoom.us/">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/">Google Suite</a> allow for remote team collaboration in realtime. With all of the different innovations in high-tech, small businesses are now able to conduct business-as-usual without requiring employees to be physically present.</p>
<h2>4. Track energy consumption with the IoT</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things, or IoT for short, is one of the more exciting ways that small businesses can use technology to go green. Essentially, “IoT” refers to a network of machines outfitted with sensors that send information to a central database. That data is then analyzed and translated into information that people can use to determine how well the machine works, if it will need maintenance soon, if it meets legal parameters, and so on.</p>
<p>With that concept in mind, you can imagine the numerous ways in which the IoT could help small businesses get into a green routine. For example, some restaurants are now using sensors like <a href="https://www.monnit.com/oem-solutions/commercial-refrigeration-monitoring-sensors">Monnit</a> (among other <a href="https://www.become.co/blog/new-restaurant-technology-trends-2019/" rel="”nofollow”">tech tools</a>) to make sure refrigerator systems are maintaining the proper temperature, which aims to reduce wasted food and save money.</p>
<p>Some manufacturing companies are also using IoT sensors to monitor heavy <a href="https://www.augury.com/products/continuous-diagnostics/">machinery performance</a>, which helps predict malfunctions and avoid the costs associated with big repairs.</p>
<p>These are just two examples of how IoT is changing how businesses operate. There are many more possible applications of IoT technology for business optimization. These new technologies are providing business owners with insights into equipment performance that they didn’t have a few short years ago, which are opening up possibilities for small businesses to incorporate sustainable practices in creative ways.</p>
<h2>5. Consider doing away with your storefront</h2>
<p>Giving customers the capability to purchase products or services online is a big way to potentially reduce your impact on the environment. Selling online has a fairly straightforward effect on becoming more eco-conscious and saving money: if a business no longer has a physical office space, it would eliminate 100 percent of the cost and environmental impact of using electricity, water, and gas at that establishment.</p>
<p>Even for a business that doesn’t completely go digital, reducing the number of people who have to drive to-and-from a storefront to get their hands on a service can help limit the carbon footprint made by that business. Going green doesn’t necessarily mean tearing up an entire business plan and starting from square one. A small business can make a contribution toward protecting the planet without undergoing a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>Being conscious of our effect on the environment doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot. In fact, the opposite can be true: practicing environmental awareness can result in savings for you, as well as benefits for future generations.</p>

The rise of services like PayPal, Zelle, and Venmo has made it super easy to send money to friends and family members on any connected device. New payment platforms like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay give customers the convenience of buying things with their phones. But what about B2B payments?</p>
<p>While much has changed in the world of consumer payments, the business-to-business (B2B) payment landscape has evolved at a much slower clip. Currently, 67 percent of consumer payments are made electronically yet 64 percent of businesses <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/comdata-paper-checks-invoices-digital-age-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still pay by check</a>. For some reason, in a world of direct deposit, instant transfers, and digital disruption, tons of businesses are still relying on a payment mechanism that’s over <a href="https://www.infoplease.com/business-finance/personal-finance/brief-history-checking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">250 years old</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-b2b-payments-untapped-opportunity-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. B2B payment market</a> accounted for $16.5 trillion. Of that, $12.24 trillion were domestic payments and $4.26 trillion were international payments. By 2020, the market is expected to grow to $23.1 trillion.</p>
<p>On a global scale, the numbers are even more staggering. <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/global-trade-psd2-money-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldwide B2B payments</a> are expected to reach $218 <span style="font-style: italic;">trillion by 2022.</span></p>
<p>Add it all up, and there’s plenty of opportunity for disruption in the B2B payment sector.</p>
<p>The winners in this space will generate a ton of revenue. At the same time, business owners across all sectors will benefit from faster payments, better customer experiences, reclaimed time, improved organizational efficiency, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>To help business owners like you navigate an evolving B2B payment landscape, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide that covers everything you need to know about business-to-business transactions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="What"></a>What are B2B payments?</h2>
<p>Very simply, B2B payments are payments made between companies. A startup tech company might pay AWS for servers. A pharmaceutical company might bring in a team of consultants to identify opportunities for improved efficiency. A restaurant owner might pay a supplier for vegetables, fruits, meats, and more.</p>
<p>Basically, any time one business invoices another business, it creates a B2B payment scenario.</p>
<p>B2B payments, while noticeably slower to evolve than business-to-customer (B2C) payments, have gone through many changes over history. Here’s a <a href="https://due.com/blog/history-b2b-payments/">brief summary</a> of that evolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historically, payments were settled in cash</li>
<li>In 1681, the first checks were issued in the United States</li>
<li>In 1850, American Express launched as a fast snail-mail delivery service</li>
<li>In 1872, Western Union added wire transfers to its existing telegraph network</li>
<li>In 1974, ACH deposits launched; four years later, all local ACHs were connected</li>
<li>By 2011, credit cards accounted for just 3 percent of all B2B payments</li>
<li>By 2014, credit cards accounted for 10 percent of all B2B payments</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, a number of new digital payment tools have emerged to provide business owners with the convenience they’ve grown accustomed to in their personal lives (more on these solutions later).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="StateOf"></a>The State of B2B Payment Processing</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-b2b-payments-untapped-opportunity-infographic.pdf">Deloitte</a>, the U.S. B2B payment market will grow from the $16.5 trillion it generated in 2014 to $23.1 trillion by 2020, enjoying a 5.8 percent CAGR over that period.</p>
<p>Of those payments, roughly 75 percent are domestic and 25 percent are international—with the bulk of those payments going to Canada, China, and Mexico. Deloitte predicts that by 2020, 61 percent of B2B payments will be made by large businesses with more than $1 billion in revenue while the rest will be made by small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Here are the industries that process the largest volume of B2B payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing – $3.53 trillion (28.8 percent)</li>
<li>Professional and business services – $2.60 trillion (21.2 percent)</li>
<li>Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing – $2.19 trillion (17.8 percent)</li>
<li>Mining – $685 billion (5.6 percent)</li>
<li>Wholesale trade – $643 billion (5.2 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>As consumers increasingly turn to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/05/03/how-customer-demands-have-pushed-finance-to-evolve/#374daa7432bc">online banking solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2018/07/14/top-mobile-peer-to-peer-payment-platforms-venmo-cash-app-zelle/36726065/">mobile payment apps</a> like Venmo, Zelle, and Square’s Cash App to pay each other—and digital tools continue to emerge to replicate this experience for business owners—we expect this market will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Kinds"></a>The Different Kinds of B2B Payment Mediums</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re a small business owner and one of your suppliers sends over an invoice. Your bill’s due in 30 days. Assuming you’re not able to barter your debts away, you’re going to have to send payment over somehow.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at some of the most common ways you can settle your account.</p>
<h3>1. Cash</h3>
<p>Just about everybody takes cash.</p>
<p>But in the world of B2B payments, unless you’re walking over to a supplier who’s across the street, you’re probably not going to send a client a briefcase full of bills.</p>
<p>When cash gets lost in the mail, it’s gone. While businesses might have used cash to pay each other over the years, this approach to B2B payments is essentially obsolete.</p>
<h3>2. Checks</h3>
<p>Paying by check is relatively easy. Sure, it’s a piece of paper, and you have an envelope and a stamp and stick it in the mail. But all things considered, the whole process should only take a few minutes (multiply that across hundreds of accounts, though, and all of a sudden it’s a massive undertaking).</p>
<p>Since it takes a few days for checks to reach their destination, paying by check can help business owners stretch their cash a bit further. Another advantage of using checks for B2B payments is that pretty much everybody takes them.</p>
<p>Checks, however, have their downsides. For starters, in an age of instant everything, checks travel via postal mail. Checks take a few days to get where they’re going, assuming they don’t get lost in the mail. And while the act of paying by check is easy, checks can be difficult to track on both sides of the balance sheet. When a check comes in, you might misplace it. When you put a check in the mail, you never know when it might be cashed.</p>
<p>Imagine in a scenario where your supplier misplaces your check. A few months go by and you forget all about it. One day, the supplier finds the check and deposits it. Depending on how much money you have in your account, this situation could cause a check to bounce.</p>
<p>Still, because of their ease of use, widespread acceptance, and security features, the bulk of B2B payments are still processed using the medium that’s been around for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a study by the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/03/03/468890515/is-it-time-to-write-off-checks">Federal Reserve</a> found that the number of checks written between 2000 and 2012 decreased by 50 percent. Interestingly, according to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/comdata-paper-checks-invoices-digital-age-innovation/">PYMNTS</a>, 64 percent of B2B payments are still made with checks. So, while we’re not using them in our personal lives anywhere near as much, they still dominate the business world.</p>
<h3>3. Wire transfers</h3>
<p>Western Union introduced the first wire transfers over 150 years ago. Here’s how it worked: you’d go into a telegraph office, pay them a sum of money and specify the intended recipient. Then Western Union would transfer the money to an office near the recipient.</p>
<p>Over time, wire transfers have evolved, using electronic networks to send money from Point A to Point B immediately through services like SWIFT and Fedwire.</p>
<p>When they were introduced, wire transfers revolutionized payments. Today, wire transfers can provide a fast method of sending money to someone; transactions can often be completed in 24 hours or less—but not always. Wire transfers can also be quite expensive. Businesses that wire money might have to pay up to $40 per transaction while recipients might be charged $10 or $15. International transaction fees can be even higher. Businesses that are keenly focused on profitability will probably prefer other cost-effective payment options.</p>
<h3>4. ACH payments</h3>
<p>Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments transfer funds from a business’ checking account to a client’s account. To pay using this method, you’ll need to fill out some paperwork and get the businesses you’re paying to do the same. Due to the inconvenience of handling a round of paperwork, you probably won’t want to pay a one-off bill via ACH transfers, but they can make repeated payments easier. If, for example, you own a company and have a contractor on a retainer, ACH may be your preferred method for facilitating recurring payments.</p>
<p>On the plus side, once you’ve filled out and submitted the paperwork, ACH deposits offer convenience to both parties. Payments are sent and received quickly—usually within three business days. <a href="https://www.firstach.com/front/ACH-Processing-Fees.html">ACH fees</a> are reasonable, too, ranging between 15 and 95 cents per transaction.</p>
<p>For these reasons, <a href="https://go.nacha.org/elevation/blog/ach-credits-to-surpass-checks-as-top-payment-method-by-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NACHA</a>, the organization behind ACH deposits, predicts that ACH transfers will overtake checks as the primary B2B payment mechanism by 2020. As it stands today, the <a href="https://www.nacha.org/ach-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network</a> already processes $43 trillion in transactions each year.</p>
<p>Like anything else, however, ACH has its downsides.</p>
<p>For starters, recipients of ACH transfers need to provide their personal bank account information. In the age of identity theft, privacy is an increasing concern. Beyond that, ACH transfers can be hard to reverse; you must report errors within 60 days for potential remedy. Finally, if you’re sending payments and don’t have enough cash in your account, you can also get hit with overdraft fees.</p>
<h3>5. Credit cards</h3>
<p>In the age of credit cards rewards programs, more and more business owners are using credit cards to pay their bills. Still, business credit card adoption is eons behind personal credit card adoption. In 2015, for example, there were 13.9 million small business credit cards — fewer than 4 percent of the number of personal credit cards.</p>
<p>If you have a high credit score, it’s most likely easy for you to get a <a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business credit card</a>. However, in the B2B world, not every vendor accepts this form of payment. While high-frequency companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Apple might have no problems paying 3–5 percent credit card processing fees, many small businesses—the contractors, startup vendors, agencies and freelancers of the world—can’t really afford to absorb those expenses. So instead of signing up to accept credit card payments, they’re happy to wait a few extra days to get a paid another way.</p>
<p>That said, many businesses <span style="font-style: italic;">like paying via credit card because they’re able to build up rewards points. Offering clients the ability to settle their bills with a credit card will enhance their experience with convenience.</span></p>
<p>Of course, you have to be willing to pay the associated credit card fees in the first place.</p>
<h3>6. Cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, cryptocurrency has grown from a niche technology championed by a small cadre of enthusiastic supporters into a mainstream juggernaut that aims to transform all sorts of things, including B2B payments.</p>
<p>Historically, it’s been difficult for businesses to send money internationally (more on that later). Most commonly, businesses conducting business with companies in other countries would send and receive payments via wire transfer—getting hit with the associated fees.</p>
<p>To this end, a number of crypto startups are emerging to facilitate payments between companies. For example, Ripple Labs—with its cryptocurrency, Ripple—aims to disrupt this space by facilitating inexpensive, real-time cross-border B2B payments. Recently, American Express indicated that a preliminary pilot test using Ripple had been a success.</p>
<p>With players like <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/cryptocurrency-corporate-technology-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JP Morgan Chase</a> entering the space too, things are just heating up.</p>
<p>While crypto is exciting, many businesses would be wise to avoid going this route. Cryptocurrencies are incredibly volatile to begin with, and most businesses won’t accept them as payments. Even if they did, there’s also the issue of fragmentation. You might want to pay someone with bitcoin only to find out they only accept Ethereum (again, assuming on the far-fetched notion they’d actually accept cryptocurrency). Making matters worse, the world of crypto has had its fair share of scams over the years.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It might be fun to think about crypto and even invest in it personally. But when it comes to B2B payments, we’re <span style="font-style: italic;">at least several years away from any reliable and proven systems being in place.</span></p>
<h3>7. Online payment platforms</h3>
<p>In the age of disruption—and with so much money on the line—it comes as no surprise that several companies are innovating in the B2B payments space. Platforms like PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Bill.com have emerged in recent years promising to streamline the online payment process for businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>Online payment platforms provide lots of upside. They’re convenient, quick, and cost-effective. Leading tools integrate with popular accounting platforms, so it’s also easy to maintain records.</p>
<p>However, with so many different players in the space, the online payment market is also fragmented. It’s unlikely that all of the companies you work with will be using a digital platform for B2B payments in the first place. Even if they are, odds are against you using the exact same solution as all of your clients and vendors. It’s a good idea to understand the top platforms and choose the one that makes the most sense for your business.</p>
<h2><a id="Challenges"></a>The Challenges with B2B Payments</h2>
<p>Of course, businesses get by under the current B2B payment landscape.</p>
<p>Still, there are a lot of problems within the existing ecosystem. Here are seven or the more common gripes about the current state of B2B payments.</p>
<h3>1. There are many payment mediums</h3>
<p>You want to pay with a credit card, but your client doesn’t take credit cards. A customer wants to pay you via wire transfer but you don’t want to absorb the high fees. Maybe you’ve just migrated to a modern platform but your vendors don’t accept payments through it.</p>
<p>Every business has its own approach to payments. One business owner’s preferred method of payment might not be taken everywhere. You might end up accepting payments via check, ACH deposit, and wire transfer while paying with credit cards, check, and online services—which isn’t the most efficient approach.</p>
<p>As more and more B2B payment solutions come online, it remains to be seen whether they will solve this problem or add to it. While companies are increasingly moving to modern payment tools to consolidate payments, it’s not all roses. 35 percent of businesses say the <a href="https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/capitalone/digitalb2bpayments.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inoperability</a> between various platforms makes them hesitate to move in this direction.</p>
<h3>2. Fraud is a danger</h3>
<p>The convoluted payments landscape makes it harder to keep track of all funds coming in and going out, which can open the doors to fraud. According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/b2b-payments-for-the-middle-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deloitte</a>, 22 percent of middle-market businesses have dealt with payments fraud in recent years.</p>
<p>No business wants to lose funds to bad behavior—which is why more and more companies are moving to modern B2B payment systems.</p>
<p>In fact, almost 80 percent of businesses <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-future-of-payments-a-corporate-perspective-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believe</a> new payment solutions can help them mitigate potential risks.</p>
<h3>3. Lack of visibility</h3>
<p>All of these customer accounts are paying you at different times through different methods. And if you’re working with a lot of vendors, you might be using several different methods to pay your own bills.</p>
<p>It’s a confusing configuration of money coming in and going out through various mediums into various accounts at various times. This cacophonous approach generates a ton of unnecessary work and makes it impossible to get crystal-clear visibility into your finances—especially as you scale.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s difficult, at best, to take advantage of any potential early payment discounts. In some instances, you might not even be aware of why certain payments are going out in the first place. If you want to get to the bottom of it, you’re going to need to put in a lot of time.</p>

Source: <a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/why-checks-still-exist-and-the-state-of-b2b-payments-b41f3cddea9c">Wharton FinTech blog.</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>4. Time</h3>
<p>B2B payments are <a href="https://medium.com/wharton-fintech/why-checks-still-exist-and-the-state-of-b2b-payments-b41f3cddea9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated</a> processes on their own. Making them more difficult, lots of companies deal with lots of payments; one study found that 54 percent of global companies <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/list/data-b2b-payments-go-digital">pay more</a> than 1,000 suppliers on a regular basis. That’s a lot of checks.</p>
<p>Coordinating that many payments takes a lot of time—particularly since most organizations have different payment cycles. One company might cut checks every two weeks and another might pay out accounts once a month.</p>
<p>Not only does it take a lot of time to manage payments on your own end, it also takes a lot of time to actually get paid. On average, it takes 45 days to process a <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B payment</a>. This finding backs up our previous research that revealed that 64 percent of small businesses routinely wait on <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">late payments</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Resource-intensive</h3>
<p>Lacking modern tools, many companies are still processing B2B payments manually. Depending on the size of the company and how many checks are being sent out every month, this approach can get quite expensive, with 62 percent of those costs attributed to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/b2b-payments-for-the-middle-market.html">labor</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of industry or size, every smart business is always aiming to get more done in less time. While a complicated approach to payments can hold you back, optimizing your approach will save a lot of time which can then be invested in other important areas of operations.</p>
<h3>6. Cost</h3>
<p>When you accept credit cards or use wire transfers, you are hit with significant fees. Even if you’re just paying your bills with checks and collecting checks as payments, managing your cash inflows and outflows will take a lot of time. When it’s your time, you’re unable to focus on growing your business because you’re managing your finances. When it someone else’s time, you’re paying them. Either way, it’s expensive.</p>
<p>Then there’s the problem with wire transfers and credit card fees. An enormous organization might be able to absorb those costs, but most small businesses won’t.</p>
<h3>7. Industry-specific problems</h3>
<p>Some different industries are governed by different sets of regulations. For example, healthcare operators may be more concerned with privacy due to HIPAA requirements.</p>
<p>If your business is dealing with several different vendors spread out across different high-security industries, you may encounter an additional set of unique payment challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="International"></a>How International B2B Payments Work</h2>
<p>Historically, it’s been difficult to make international payments. Just take a look at this example of a cross-border transaction, courtesy of a 2018 report from <a href="https://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/9308A_1-2018-9-17.pdf">eServGlobal</a>:</p>
<figure id="attachment_12033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12033" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-600 wp-image-12033" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Example-of-a-cross-border-transaction.png" alt="Example of a cross border transaction" width="600" height="353" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12033" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Example of a complex cross-border transaction. Source: <a href="https://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/9308A_1-2018-9-17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cross-Border Payments Landscape</a>, prepared by eServGlobal, September 2018.</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, international payments have traditionally been sent via wire transfer. Not only do wire transfers come with hefty fees, but businesses are also often on the hook for currency conversion costs. Beyond that, it might take several days before funds from a wire transfer ended up coming through; sometimes it can be faster. But it can also be tricky to get visibility into these transactions. Once a transfer is sent, you can’t easily track it without contacting the sender (such as your bank).</p>
<p>In today’s increasingly globalized world, more and more companies are doing business internationally. Remember, by 2022, it’s expected that global <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/global-trade-psd2-money-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-border payments</a> will reach $218 trillion; <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial%20Services/Our%20Insights/Global%20payments%20Expansive%20growth%20targeted%20opportunities/Global-payments-map-2018.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B payments</a> will account for the biggest chunk of that figure.</p>
<p>In an age where everything is at our fingertips and we can PayPal somebody $100 right this second, why do international B2B payments still have to be so expensive? And why do several players—potentially the buyer’s bank, the buyer’s bank correspondent, the seller’s bank correspondent, and the seller’s bank—need to take a cut of each transfer?</p>
<p>More and more companies that conduct business on an international level are looking for new B2B payment solutions that are faster, less opaque, and cheaper. Banks better watch out. According to <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-85/Accenture-International-Payments-Digital-World-International-Payments-Digital-World.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accenture</a>, as much as 25 percent of banks’ traditional international payment revenue streams are in jeopardy due to these developments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Solving B2B Payment Challenges</h2>
<p>The B2B payment landscape is riddled with inefficiencies and other challenges. With so much money at stake, the entire global economy is relying on a more efficient way forward. This is why we’re seeing an increasing number of new B2B payment solutions on the market.</p>
<p>By solving the aforementioned challenges, businesses across all industries will enjoy a number of <a href="https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/capitalone/digitalb2bpayments.pdf">benefits</a>. Here are nine of them.</p>
<h3>1. Reduce your costs</h3>
<p>It currently costs up to $22 to <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/payment-methods-mastercard-visa-b2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">process an invoice</a> manually. With a modern B2B payment solution in place, however, that number can drop to $7—or even less.</p>
<p>The strongest businesses are always looking to reduce their costs however they can. Optimizing B2B payments presents a great opportunity to reduce cash outflows—which is exactly why many businesses are investing in new payment solutions. One study found that 65 percent of<a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-future-of-payments-a-corporate-perspective-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> respondents</a> are primarily interested in digital solutions because they expect them to be more cost-effective.</p>
<p>This is precisely why 90 percent of corporate decision makers believe that moving to <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-future-of-payments-a-corporate-perspective-report.pdf">electronic payments</a> will have a very high or high impact on their business over the next three years.</p>
<h3>2. Reclaim your time</h3>
<p>Processing B2B payments the traditional way takes a lot of time. With a modern solution in place, much of the repetitive work that had to be done manually is automated—giving you and your employees more time to focus on other important areas of operations.</p>
<h3>3. Faster payments</h3>
<p>Solving B2B payment challenges means you’ll be able to process invoices faster—which means your clients get paid faster. It also means that your suppliers can pay you faster. Always know where your bank account balances stand and get paid much sooner for work you’ve already done.</p>
<h3>4. Get more visibility</h3>
<p>Modern B2B payment solutions provide full visibility into payments. They also integrate with existing tools—like QuickBooks and FreshBooks. This makes it easier for you to analyze spending to see where your money is going while taking advantage of payment discounts.</p>
<h3>5. Less paper to manage</h3>
<p>Modern payment tools enable you to eliminate much—if not all—of the paperwork from your financial workflows. Not only does this make everything easier to track, it’s also better for the environment.</p>
<h3>6. Improve your cash flow</h3>
<p>Faster payments that are easier to process, reclaimed time due to automation, and more visibility into your finances add up to deliver improved cash flow. With more cash on hand, it’s easier to respond to changes rapidly and pursue new opportunities.</p>
<h3>7. More convenience</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of B2B payments is the fact that there are so many different mediums and everyone wants to pay their preferred way. By accepting digital payments, you give your customers an additional way to pay—providing more convenience to improve the customer experience while increasing the chances you get paid faster.</p>
<p>The same holds true when it comes to paying your business customers. With modern solutions in place, you can send money quickly and easily, without massive fees.</p>
<h3>8. Improve your security</h3>
<p>In any financial transaction, security is a top priority. While modern B2B payment solutions are still susceptible to hackers, today’s leading providers usually have top-notch security and a team of engineers and data analysts on hand to detect intrusions—and even prevent them from happening in the first place. This protection, coupled with the way digital systems track payments, work together to deliver enhanced security.</p>
<h3>9. ROI</h3>
<p>Reduced costs, reclaimed time, faster payments, more visibility into your finances, less paper usage, better cash flow, and greater convenience. An investment in a modern payment solution drives considerable ROI—and quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Top"></a>The Top B2B Payments Platforms and Companies</h2>
<p>In recent years, several vendors have offered solutions to the B2B payment problem; it seems as though more and more platforms are coming online every day.</p>
<p>As you start researching a new payment solution, you’ll quickly find out you have a lot of options. To make your search easier, here is a brief summary of five of today’s top B2B electronic payments vendors.</p>
<h3>1. PayPal</h3>
<p>PayPal offers a B2B payment service that makes it easy to invoice clients and easy to send payments to and receive payments from vendors on the network. Buyers can pay invoices with their PayPal balances at no cost; the seller incurs a fee of 30 cents plus 2.9 percent on each transaction paid with a credit card.</p>
<h3>2. Square</h3>
<p>Square is popular in the B2C market; if you’ve never used one of their devices, odds are you’ve at least seen one. Square also offers a number of B2B payment solutions like credit card processing, which costs 2.75 percent per transaction; invoicing, which costs 2.9 percent of the amount plus 30 cents; and an interface that provides insight into your payments. Square has several solutions on top of these. With everything seemingly at a different price point, figuring out how much you’re actually paying can be quite tricky at times, depending on your setup.</p>
<h3>3. Due</h3>
<p>Due provides payment solutions to businesses of all sizes, including a digital wallet that makes it fast and easy to send and receive money online, an interface that provides visibility into your cash inflows and outflows, and low-cost credit card processing services that start at 2.8 percent.</p>
<h3>4. Bill.com</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill.com</a> is an online payment platform that helps businesses automate the AR and AP processes. The platform integrates with popular accounting software, and it also enables you to send payments to companies in other countries without incurring wire transfer fees. Bill.com memberships start at $29 per user per month. If you aren’t sending a lot of invoices or receiving a lot of payments, you may want to consider another option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Current"></a>Current B2B Payments Trends Businesses Should Know</h2>
<p>What’s happening in the world of B2B payments? Here are five trends that are transforming the way businesses pay each other.</p>
<h3>1. New B2B payment solutions are popping up everywhere</h3>
<p>Since there’s so much opportunity in this space, new B2B payment systems are emerging <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-85/Accenture-International-Payments-Digital-World-International-Payments-Digital-World.pdf">all over the world</a>. It remains to be seen which of these solutions will end up dominating the market. But it appears that it’s only a matter of time before checks and wire transfers become a thing of the past.</p>
<h3>2. More businesses are using digital payments</h3>
<p>Seeking a better way forward, businesses are increasingly moving to digital payments. According to <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/middle-companies-digital-b2b-payments/">one study</a>, nearly 50 percent of mid-sized companies have digitalized nearly 50 percent of their payments. We believe this trend will continue to accelerate for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3>3. Legacy tools are holding businesses back from using new tools</h3>
<p>Businesses hesitate to use new payment tools because they are still relying on lethargic legacy tools that aren’t flexible enough to adapt to the fast-paced needs of today. However, as we move further into the future, more and more businesses will ditch their legacy systems and move to modern solutions.</p>
<h3>4. Modern B2B payment solutions are driving strong business outcomes</h3>
<p>By reducing costs, increasing efficiency, accelerating payments, and providing more convenience, B2B payment solutions are helping businesses increase productivity and profitability. That’s the goal, right?</p>
<h3>5. Businesses are focusing internally at first</h3>
<p>When businesses adopt new payments solutions, they start off using them <a href="https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/comm/capitalone/digitalb2bpayments.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internally</a>, covering things like employee payroll and benefits. As they become comfortable using the new systems in-house, they are more willing to try them in other areas (e.g., accounts payable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Lookfor"></a>What to Look for in a B2B Payment Vendor</h2>
<p>By now, you understand why a traditional approach to B2B payments falls short and how modern solutions provide a better way forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t just switch to any digital payment solution and expect everything to turn out perfectly. You need to do your due diligence and find a platform that works best for you.</p>
<p>Here are six things to look for when searching for a B2B payment vendor.</p>
<h3>1. Utility</h3>
<p>If your company does a lot of international business, you need a solution that’s built to streamline cross-border payments. If your company extends trade credit to your customers, you need a solution designed to solve that problem. First and foremost, you need to look for a payment platform that meets your specific use case.</p>
<h3>2. Reliability</h3>
<p>It’s one thing to find a tool that appears to meet your needs. It’s quite another to find a tool that you can rely on every day. According to <a href="https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-future-of-payments-a-corporate-perspective-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BNY Mellon</a>, 54 percent of businesses say that reliability is the biggest factor when considering moving to a new payment platform. This makes sense: Payments are so important. You need a tool that you can count on.</p>
<h3>3. Integration</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems with B2B payments is the lack of visibility into your finances. Today’s leading payment solutions integrate with popular accounting tools, such as FreshBooks, QuickBooks, Xero, and Harvest. Not only will the right solution make payments easier, it’ll also give you a better view of your complete financial picture.</p>
<h3>4. Ease of use</h3>
<p>The whole point of changing your approach to B2B payments is to make things easier. The right solution should be quick and intuitive. For example, some leading solutions enable sellers to get paid on invoices right away—and in just a few clicks. On the flip side, buyers are given 60 interest-free days before payments are due, and they can extend those terms for a fee.</p>
<h3>5. Ease and speed of approval</h3>
<p>You’ve found the perfect payment solution. Awesome! Now, you find out that the application process is cumbersome and odds of approval are not in your favor. Not good! Avoid this problem by finding a payment solution that has a simple, straightforward application process so you can find out whether you’re approved right away. Leading providers can underwrite B2B buyers within minutes, helping them increase their buying power right away.</p>
<h3>6. Vendor reputation</h3>
<p>Once you’ve found a solution that suits your needs, do a bit of research on the vendors you’re considering. Read some <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/fundbox-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a>, and compare reviews on different websites to get a good idea of what customers are saying. See if you can find any specific funding information. Browse the vendor’s website to see what resources and what level of support they offer. You should be able to find a ton of information on the vendors worth considering.</p>
<p>If you can’t find any genuine positive reviews, or if you can’t find many reviews at all, that could be a red flag. It might mean that the company is new and doesn’t have a reliable track record. Or, it might mean the company is hard to engage with, and not many users have actually worked with them. Of course, since we’re talking about finances here, it might also mean that the company is more of a scam than a business. A lack of reviews doesn’t always mean that something is wrong with a vendor—it might just mean the company is new—but it can be a helpful indicator of how trustworthy they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id="Bestpractices"></a>Best Practices for B2B Payments</h2>
<p>Every business is different, which means that there is no such thing as the “perfect” approach to B2B payments. What works well for your company might not make any sense for another business, and vice versa. That said, there are still some universal tips to keep in mind that should make your B2B payments process a whole lot smoother whether you’re the seller or the buyer.</p>
<h3>When you’re the seller:</h3>
<h3>1. Invoice clients immediately after work is completed</h3>
<p>Instead of waiting until the end of the month to bill your clients, invoice them as soon as work is completed. That way, you should be able to accelerate payments from a few of your clients, at the very least.</p>
<h3>2. Encourage customers to pay you electronically</h3>
<p>Not only are checks expensive to process, they’re also easy to misplace—and that’s assuming they don’t get lost in the mail. When customers pay electronically, not only is it convenient, it’s also much easier to keep track of payments—and can be much cheaper, too.</p>
<h3>3. Consider early payment discounts and late payment penalties</h3>
<p>If you’re struggling with cash flow issues, you can increase the chances your customers pay you on time by offering early payment discounts. On the flip side, you can penalize late payments by charging interest on overdue accounts. This approach won’t work for every business, so do your due diligence to make sure it works for yours before you go down this route.</p>
<h3>4. Determine whether you should accept credit cards</h3>
<p>If your business processes a lot of transactions, it might make sense to accept credit cards. If you don’t invoice that many customers, you probably want to avoid accepting credit cards unless you are comfortable absorbing significant fees.</p>
<h3>5. Consider offloading your risk</h3>
<p>If you’re a B2B merchant and you offer net payment terms to your buyers, you’re essentially acting like a bank: you’re advancing funds to your buyers and accepting the risk that they won’t pay you back in a timely manner, or at all. Look for ways to minimize or eliminate the risk of non-paying or late-paying buyers by partnering with a <a href="https://fundbox.com/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B2B credit and payments partner</a> like Fundbox to offer trade credit without shouldering all of the risk yourself.</p>
<h3>When you’re the buyer:</h3>
<h3>1. Pay with a credit card to rack up rewards points</h3>
<p>If a seller accepts credit cards, you have a business credit card, and you have enough cash in the bank to pay your bills on time each month, you might want to pay invoices with a credit card to accumulate rewards points. A few percentage points here and there can translate into significant savings spread out over a long period of time.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t settle your invoices until they are due</h3>
<p>Imagine you get an invoice in the mail today and payment is due in 30 days. Unless there are payment discounts you can take advantage of, you shouldn’t pay your bills until they are due. It’s an easy trick to extend your cash flow a little longer.</p>
<h3>3. Let a vendor know if payment will be late</h3>
<p>Many businesses across all industries run into cash flow problems from time to time. If you are unable to pay your invoice on time, give your vendor the courtesy of letting them know about your financial situation. Assuming you are on good terms with a vendor, there’s a chance you’ll get lucky and they’ll be flexible on this issue—as long as it doesn’t become the norm.</p>
<h3>4. Pay electronically when you can</h3>
<p>Sending checks through the mail takes time. You also have to pay for envelopes and stamps. Paying electronically not only eliminates these costs and helps your team reclaim a lot of time, it also makes it much easier for your accounting department to track cash inflows and outflows.</p>
<h3>5. Ask your vendor about better payment terms</h3>
<p>Often times, a vendor will work with you on your payment terms. They might not tell you this up front, but if you need a little longer to pay or you’d like to pay a certain way, your vendor might be more than willing to work with you to keep your business. Ask your vendor what type of net terms they typically offer, how you can qualify for the most favorable terms, and whether they use any trade credit payments partners.</p>
<p>Start your relationship on the right foot, build a positive track record with your vendors, and don’t be afraid to ask them about alternative payment plans, longer trade credit terms, and whatever else will help improve your business relationship from your point of view. Over time, as you continue to build a solid relationship, you may be able to renegotiate and improve your terms even more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.marqeta.com/">Marqeta</a> is a financial technology firm which provides access to an Issuer Processor API for developers of commerce solutions. Based in Oakland, CA, and founded in 2010, the company aims to revolutionize the way that we make payments and make business transactions more efficient.</p>
<p>We recently had the opportunity to meet with Lester Chen, Director of Product Management for Marqeta’s e-commerce products. In our discussion, we explored his approach to creating truly simple customer experiences, the evolution of digital payments, and his predictions for the future of digital commerce.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fundbox:</span> Hi Lester, let’s start with an introduction. Tell us about you and what you do.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lester Chen:</span> Sure. To give you the total picture, let me start off saying that I&#8217;m a newlywed, I got married last May. (I love you, Renee!) At Marqeta, I work on products that help people get paid with ease. That&#8217;s my professional life. To round it out, I also do my part in public service by serving as a member of the San Mateo Library Board of Trustees.</p>
<h3>Awesome, thanks for spending time with us today. At Marqeta, you are a Director of Product. Can you explain a little bit about the problems that you&#8217;re currently solving?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> We have different product lines within Marqeta and I’m the product lead for one of those product lines. My area is what we call the e-commerce product line. It includes online travel, online retail, and digital media agencies.</p>
<p>What these three segments have in common is, they&#8217;re all aggregators. With an online travel agency, you don&#8217;t have to go here and there to book hotels and tours. With an online retailer, you get to create a selection.</p>
<p>What I help all of my customers with has to do with their payments: how they can pay their suppliers so they can get the best selection for their customers and then grow their businesses.</p>
<p>In product management, we are basically problem solvers. We look at pain points our customers face with paying suppliers. Then we make sure it gets easier and easier so they don&#8217;t have to think about it. That frees them to focus on what they do best, which is growing their business and serving their customers, and not worry about payments, which is our problem.</p>
<h3>In your product line, is there a typical customer profile or size that you&#8217;re focused on?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> We have a range of customers from large to small. Definitely, this year, we have a little bit more of a focus on platforms. We want to democratize fintech. We want to make sure that fintech isn&#8217;t just for tech giants or big corporations, but that it’s available to everybody. Through platforms, we can reach smaller businesses.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Open banking” is a phrase that we are hearing a lot lately to describe the new financial world and this emerging ecosystem of technology products, like yours at Marqeta, and ours here at Fundbox. What’s your take on open banking?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> I&#8217;d say our take on it is what we&#8217;ve been seeing recently, which is this trend towards broader solutions. Let me explain what I mean by that and give an example. A leader I really admire once said their bar for a good product is whether its benefits are “ridiculously obvious.”</p>
<p>This means the product in question is not only 10 times (10x) more effective, but also 10 times easier to use than what came before it. Every business has a ton of problems to solve. If something&#8217;s going to work for them, then it&#8217;s got to be so ridiculously easy for them [to use] before they will even think about adopting it, about switching from their current solution.</p>
<p>I think where we are right now, to your point about being more open and things being more connected, is a market full of point solutions that pass the “ridiculously obvious” test, but when a business tries to use them all together, things become a bit clunky.</p>
<p>Then, as a business owner, you&#8217;re stringing together a series of these 10x solutions, but the result is not 10x overall.</p>
<h3>The Marqeta platform integrates with large partners like Visa and Mastercard. Can you explain in simple terms where your platform sits within the ecosystem of a transaction?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> Where we sit is on the paying side. We issue and process payments. We issue instruments that allow people to make payments. That could be a physical card, it could be a virtual card, it could be a tokenized card, but in all cases, they&#8217;re being used to make a payment.</p>
<p>For me and my product line, I&#8217;m helping my customers pay their suppliers. It could be a travel agency using a virtual card to hold a reservation for their traveler at hotel. It could be a retail aggregator paying their suppliers. Or it could be a digital media ad agency paying publishers to run effective advertising campaigns for their clients.</p>
<h3>Are there other companies or products besides your own that you look to or keep tabs on, for either a competitive intelligence or to get ideas?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> There&#8217;s not a particular company I look at, personally, because there are so many to choose from. I&#8217;m a firm believer that the best seed for a creative spark can often come from outside your industry. Cross-pollination across industries can get you something really different. I try to keep my eye out for interesting solutions, so [inspiration] can come from companies outside the industry, from competitors, from customers&#8230; They&#8217;re all trying to innovate, too.</p>
<h3>Are there game-changing innovations or news that have inspired you in the past year that come to mind?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> On the inspirational theme, I want to tell a story about Western Union. Western Union started in 1851 with the telegraph, and now they&#8217;ve<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2018/western-union-cross-border-payments-partnership/"> </a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2018/western-union-cross-border-payments-partnership/">partnered with Amazon</a></span> so that shoppers can pay cash for cross-border online retail orders. It&#8217;s an interesting innovation that allows international folks who are underbanked and are really used to cash, to not be cut off from the future of retail.</p>
<p>Western Union has been around for a long time but they are still innovating and figuring out a way to bring something new to solve this problem. I think that&#8217;s good news for your audience who are small businesses because now, there are more and more choices for [financial] solutions that fit their needs.</p>
<p>Today, there’s more and more customer choice, however you want to run your business—you&#8217;ll probably find at least one, maybe to two options out there that really suits you. I think it&#8217;s an exciting time if Western Union is still doing interesting things.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10554" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10554" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-10554" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/telegraph.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="309" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/telegraph.jpg 2280w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/telegraph-768x474.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/telegraph-1536x949.jpg 1536w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/telegraph-2048x1265.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10554" class="wp-caption-text">Ancient technology! The telegraph. (<a href="http://www.wanowandthen.com/telegraph.html">Image</a> via <em>Western Union Now and Then</em>.)</figcaption></figure>
<h3>That&#8217;s a great example of a company and brand that has evolved so much over the years. You mentioned something else that was interesting there about the number of solutions that are emerging today, driven by technology. Our customers aren&#8217;t so different: at Fundbox we serve a lot of small business customers, and none of them got into business because they wanted to do paperwork and keep up with financial solutions. With so many solutions out there, would you have any advice for business owners who are not financial or technology experts, who want to keep up?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> My advice for small businesses is, you don&#8217;t necessarily have to look for the point solutions to solve your problems. Instead, I would look at platforms. You want everything to work well together.</p>
<p>As an example, look in the travel space, one of my customer segments. When we think of travel, we often think everything is online. That’s true for the airlines and hotels, but then when you take a vacation, what do you do once you got there? You want to be entertained, you want to do activities.</p>
<p>About three quarters of tours and activities, you still need to book offline. In the past few years I&#8217;ve seen entrepreneurs create platforms to help tour operators which tend to be smaller businesses.</p>
<p>Now imagine those smaller tour operators thinking, “Geez, I&#8217;ve got to figure out how to take online payment, set up a website, create a reservation platform…”</p>
<p>They don’t want all this hassle to try to make it all fit together. It&#8217;s not what they got in a business to do.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, I would say, if you&#8217;re just trying to get tech-enabled, look for a <span style="font-style: italic;">platform</span> in your space. There&#8217;s a smaller number of options to evaluate and they&#8217;ll help you build a broader solution so that you can be a fully digital business. As you get more advanced you can figure out your niche or specialty, and start looking for things that accentuate and play to your strengths.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s great advice. I think a lot of entrepreneurs see a problem and think, &#8220;I have a problem. I&#8217;m going to go online and use search engines and try and solve that problem.&#8221; Then they end up with a collection of point solutions, like you said.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> Yes. This is my daily life. Recently, my dad asked me to open a CD for him at online bank. My dad&#8217;s 75 and he&#8217;s retired. He just wants safety, inflation protection and that&#8217;s good enough. He said, &#8220;Hey son, this is an online bank. I think they got a good interest rate. Help me open the account.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;m helping him through this, and 90% of the process is super easy. It’s online, digital, and smooth. Then it comes the time to deposit the funds. We have to mail in a signature card and a check. It feels like exiting a superhighway like the German Autobahn and getting on to an unpaved road.</p>
<p>I suspect that if I wasn&#8217;t there, he may have just given up in frustration, and that would cost him the chance to protect his money. I think businesses have this experience, too. [They hit a roadblock in a setup process], it&#8217;s manual, it&#8217;s slow, and it&#8217;s unpleasant. Then either it&#8217;s so frustrating, they give up and they don&#8217;t even use the original point solution or now they&#8217;re spending more time doing it. This situation is costing them opportunities to grow.</p>
<p>One of my predictions for this year is a continued focus on how businesses can become fully digital. Companies are going to look more broadly. Businesses should not miss out on opportunities because they had to waste time stitching solutions together.</p>
<h3>You do have kind of a unique window into the future because of what you do. How do you envision the future of e-commerce and how payment technologies like yours are going to bring us there?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> Yes. I need to take a step back because there&#8217;s so many different variants. I hesitate to make predictions about the path we take to get there, but the trend is always going to be to make things easier for the end customer, whether you&#8217;re a traveler, a shopper, or an advertiser. That&#8217;s just timeless. People just want things to be easier. I also think the quality of experience is going to go up. Every fintech vendor I know is trying to improve.</p>
<p>There are internal pressures. We&#8217;re always trying to make a product more effective for our customers.</p>
<p>We also have a lot of external pressures. Competitors are getting bigger. There&#8217;s the economic cycles—caveat, this is not investment advice—whenever the economic cycle turns down, customers are going to look at any solution carefully. As we&#8217;re scrutinized, we&#8217;re all going to have to up our game.</p>
<p>There’s also regulation. Especially in Europe, they’re generally a little bit more proactive in the U.S. in regulation. As the rules change we still have to be just as innovative. To keep innovation going in a increased regulatory regime, we&#8217;re going to have to up our game. I personally don&#8217;t want to complain about regulation. It&#8217;s just a challenge to be creative and still be innovative.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t give you a picture of how e-commerce will look in the future, but it&#8217;s going to be easier and higher-quality. We&#8217;re going to keep getting closer and closer to fully digital businesses.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the future of e-commerce, and as payments providers that are supporting these businesses, we&#8217;ll be obsessed with making payments invisible so that they can get to that future and never have to think about payments.</p>
<h3>Awesome. I think that&#8217;s a great note to end on. Any final thoughts about fintech and the world of payments that you want to share before we sign off?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LC:</span> Quality is going up, and you&#8217;ll see the businesses are becoming more fully digital. That&#8217;s not just for the big name companies. We’re going to see that democratization of fintech.</p>
<h3>Could not agree more. I think both of our companies are trying to work toward that in our own way. Thanks, Lester.</h3>

We’re excited to announce that the new Fundbox mobile apps have launched!</p>
<p>As of this month, you can now access you Fundbox account using either the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fundbox.mobile">Android</a></span> or iOS Fundbox app. If you have previously connected your accounting software, you are invited to use the app.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Download the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fundbox.mobile">Fundbox Android app</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> from the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fundbox.mobile">Google Play store</a></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></li>

</ul>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2ad2c352-fdd4-42a8-87f7-71552f293540_Fundbox20Apple20App20Store2012-2018.png" alt="Fundbox iOS app in the Apple App store" width="500" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Fundbox iOS app in the Apple App store</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We first released our iOS app a little while ago, but we heard your feedback that it lacked some important features. That’s why we redesigned it from top to bottom, to give you the best possible experience using Fundbox from your smartphone. We also heard from many of you that an Android app would be helpful, so we created one and released it for the first time this month.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here are a few features to know about the Fundbox mobile apps:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Manage your existing Fundbox line of credit on the go</li>
<li>Lightening fast and secure fingerprint login</li>
<li>Customize your notifications so you don’t miss a thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like the Fundbox experience you know on your desktop, you can use the app to check your balances, draw funds, view unpaid invoices, and make repayments. Manage your business funds anywhere, anytime.</p>
<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/d8e2818d-5320-4620-9817-6a17106bbb8a_Fundbox20Google20Play20app20store2012-2018.png" alt="Fundbox iOS app in the Apple App store" width="500" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Fundbox Android app in the Google Play store</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One last important note:</span> If you connected to Fundbox using a business bank account, and <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> your accounting software, you won’t be able to use the apps yet. We’ll be adding new functionality in the months ahead to better serve all of our customers, so please stay tuned.</p>

<p>A recent Bredin Insight report, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://bredin.com/blog/2018/10/bredin-report-smb-tech-purchase-plans-what-why-and-when/">SMB Tech Purchase Plans: What, Why and When</a></span>, polled small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) to find out how they use technology to grow.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the results and what they might mean for your business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who’s Buying Technology?</span></h2>
<p>The survey polled 600 U.S. SMBs businesses, categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very Small Businesses (VSBs, up to 19 employees) 58%</li>
<li>Small Businesses (SBs, 20-99 employees) 25%</li>
<li>Midsized Businesses (MBs, 100-500 employees) 17%</li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses were split fairly evenly among professional services businesses, manufacturing and retail/wholesaling (about 30% each) with the remainder in personal services and education/training fields.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, the majority of respondents have been in business quite a while.</p>
<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/44b2d1a3-b395-48cc-85c8-7d543a532628_image1.png" alt="" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image Source: <a href="https://bredin.com/blog/category/the-bredin-report/">The Bredin Report</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here’s how the businesses’ revenues break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under $500K – 50%</li>
<li>$500K-$999K – 15%</li>
<li>$1M-$4M – 21%</li>
<li>$5M+ – 15%</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority are projecting revenue growth for 2018. Some 37% project growth of between 10% and 100% (the study dubs these “fast growth” companies), while 9% project over 100% growth (dubbed “hypergrowth” companies).</p>
<p>“Slow growth” businesses (25% of respondents) project growth of under 10%. Fewer than one-fourth (23%) project no revenue growth at all.</p>
<p>Younger business owners, owners of bigger companies, and owners of younger businesses are the most likely to be optimistic about their 2018 revenue growth.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do SMBs buy technology?</span></h2>
<p>There are several reasons why those surveyed choose to make new technology purchases.</p>
<ul>
<li>One-third (33%) of survey respondents are early adopters who see technology as essential to their success.</li>
<li>One-fourth are late adopters who see technology as an expense to minimize; they adopt new technology only when it’s absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Most respondents (42%) fall somewhere in between: They know technology is important, but they aren’t the first in line to buy the latest shiny object. Instead, they wait until new technology has been proven before investing in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a connection between business growth and early adoption of technology? That depends.</p>
<p>Companies categorized as fast- or hyper-growth are much more likely than businesses projecting slow or no growth to view technology as “essential” and to be aggressive tech adopters. In contrast, slow- or no-growth businesses are more likely to wait until a purchase is “absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>It’s possible that rapid business growth requires greater tech adoption—but it could also be that technology drives rapid growth.</p>
<p>Younger business owners are more likely to be early adopters than older ones, as are owners of bigger businesses.</p>
<p>Here are the top reasons all SMBs purchase technology:</p>
<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0bc9b0c0-5d25-4723-8d53-a8949e4e4264_image2.png" alt="" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image Source: The Bredin Report</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The majority of reasons are reactive—just 39% are proactively embracing technology to take advantage of an opportunity. Generation X business owners (age 35 – 49) are the most likely to do this. More than half (59%) of Gen X entrepreneurs purchase technology to take advantage of an opportunity, compared to 42% of millennials and 31% of baby boomers.</p>
<h2>What hardware are small business owners buying?</h2>
<p>Here are the top 10 types of hardware small businesses either have or will purchase in 2018-2019.</p>
<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bd93388e-1a39-45a0-b367-2d0d7f51417e_image3.png" alt="" width="600" height="913" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Image source: The Bredin Report</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Businesses under 10 years old are more likely than average to have aggressive plans to adopt all 10 of these technologies by the end of 2018.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">What software are small business owners buying?</span></h2>
<p>The top types of software small businesses either have or will purchase in 2018-2019 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Security software</li>
<li>Accounting/financial management software</li>
<li>Storage/file backup software</li>
<li>Payment software</li>
</ol>
<p>More than half of small business owners either have these tools in place or will be acquiring them this year.</p>
<p>However, there are several areas where small business owners falling short in software adoption, as you can see from the chart below:</p>
<figure style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/d4247bfa-7cf1-4078-8e2b-5116f4e509a1_image4.png" alt="" width="600" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Image source: The Bredin Report</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Only 11% have CRM/sales force automation tools in place; an additional 15% plan to add them by the end of 2019.</li>
<li>Just 13% have marketing automation software in place. Nine percent will acquire it this year and 10% in 2019.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, fewer than one-third of companies have file sharing software in place, and only 14% will add it by the end of 2019.</li>
<li>Another tool not widely adopted is social media management software: 24% currently use it and 17% more plan to acquire it by the end of 2019.</li>
<li>Just 19% have website analytics software in place, and only 15% will acquire it by the end of 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a reasonable bet that the software tools above could have some significant and immediate benefits for your business. Sales, marketing and social media management are huge concerns for most entrepreneurs, and automating as much as you can in these areas can save you time, make your marketing more effective and save you money.</p>
<p>Also of note: No-growth companies are the most likely to have “no plans” to purchase new software by the end of 2019. That seems to tell us something about the connection between technology adoption and business growth.</p>
<p>When technology has so much potential to help your business grow, scrimping in this area is usually not the best long-term choice. If you’re reluctant to adopt new technology because it’s not in the budget, it may be time to explore creative <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/">financing solutions</a></span> to meet the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>As an executive and leader, Scott Stewart has spent over 20 years working to connect, educate, and mobilize diverse teams to achieve meaningful public policy goals. Previously, he designed, developed and ran the first FinTech Ideas Festival, which featured the world’s leaders at the confluence of finance, innovation and technology was livestreamed by CNBC, and hosted 110 CEOs from the financial services and technology industries.</p>
<p>Today, Scott serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://innovativelending.org/">Innovative Lending Platform Association</a></span>. The ILPA is a trade association representing online business lending and financial firms.</p>
<p>Fundbox <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/6th-avenue-capital-bluevine-and-fundbox-join-ilpa-300713436.html">recently</a> became a proud member of the ILPA. To mark this milestone, we connected with Scott to chat about the role of the ILPA, and to learn from his industry insights and unique vantage point.</p>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7a616ddd-80eb-4344-8f4b-b5bbdfc706fe_pasted20image200.png" alt="Headshot of Scott Stewart, CEO of the Innovative Platform Lending Association" width="300" height="300" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Scott Stewart, CEO of the Innovative Platform Lending Association</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Fundbox</span></strong><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> C</span><span style="font-style: italic;">an you start by </span><span style="font-style: italic;">explaining</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> what the Innovative Lending Platform Association is and what the key functions of the organization are?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scott Stewart:</span> Absolutely. The Innovative Lending Platform Association is a 501(c)(6) trade association that represents online small business lenders. We represent the largest and most recognizable brands in the industry including Kabbage, OnDeck, BlueVine, Fundbox, Lendio, The Business Backer, Breakout Capital Finance, Headway Capital and 6th Avenue Capital.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some of the key functions of the organization are working with and providing resources to small business lending companies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A lot of companies don’t have the resources to invest in government and external affairs, but they face public policy challenges. As an organization, one of our primary functions is to bring together all of the resources we can to educate and influence public policy at the state and the federal government level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We also do cybersecurity, privacy, and fraud prevention work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally, we offer our members a view to the future. Our members want to know what is coming next in terms of emerging technologies, and find a way to invest them in globally significant opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">The ILPA has developed a tool called SMART Box. What is that and how does it help small businesses?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS:</span> SMART Box stands for “Straightforward Metrics Around Rate and Total cost.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We were founded as organization to house this tool for online small business lenders to disclose the cost of capital to their small business borrowers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are four metrics in the box. It’s a disclosure that shows total cost of capital, what you’re going to pay for your credit, the APR, the monthly total cost, and cents on a dollar. We also showcase a couple questions about any pre-payment issues you should know about.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We feel like it’s an important way to show our small business borrowers exactly what they’re getting when they’re taking out capital from our companies and to provide them an opportunity to compare various products in an apples-to-apples fashion.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Who’s using SMART Box now? How is adoption going?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Adoption is just beginning. Our initial lending members have adopted it. I would expect that within the next six months or so, our three new members that just joined ILPA [including Fundbox] will implement SMART Box as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The SMART Box is an important tool for the small business borrower. The goal is to help them understand and compare various capital options.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">APR is often not the most helpful metric for our industry. Why do so many financial professionals see it as an imperfect metric? On the other hand, why do so many small business borrowers really want to know that number?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS:</span> APR is in some ways a relic of the 1960s mortgage market, but it is something that small business borrowers recognize and want to see. Let me give you a quick example of why it doesn’t make a lot of sense in certain circumstances.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Imagine I am a small business owner, I own a hair salon for example, with two chairs in my shop, and I’m looking for additional $20,000 to add two more chairs to the shop. I’ve got great revenues, I’ve been in business for a couple of years, things are going fine, but I launched my business using funds from my credit cards and it blew up my personal credit score. Let’s say my personal credit score is 640.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I go to a bank, and the bank says, “Are you kidding me? There is no chance you’re going to have any access to credit from us, because based on our risk and regulatory requirements we can’t serve you.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That business owner can come to us and we say, “Great. We are happy to provide you access to capital. We see you’ve got a great business going. You have a lot of things that are going just well for you, and we don’t really care about the FICO score, so here’s $20,000. You’re going to pay us $2,000 over the course of six months.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So, two gets you 20. That’s an easy number to understand: that’s the total cost of the capital. When you do the math on APR, that’s a 40% APR.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That can sound high. But typically, the small business borrower doesn’t care about that metric, but they want to see it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As we’ve gone through our research, we’ve found that when our member companies launched SMART Box, they had no slowdown in originations for their small business borrowers due to that top line number. The first number a business borrower looks at is the total cost of capital.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They might say, “Okay, 2,000 gets me 20,000. I get that. I’m going to pay 2,000 over the course of six months. I don’t care that the APR is 40% because it doesn’t matter in my world of trying to build revenues for my business. I’m going to turn that into $50,000 or $60,000 a year in new revenue. It makes all the sense in the world.”</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">You recently participated in the </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/2018/Pages/default.aspx">AI for Global Good Summit</a></span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">What was that event and what is the value to your members in engaging with events like this?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS:</span> The AI for Global Good Summit is hosted by the United Nations. I ended up with a lot of interesting globally-significant contacts when I started the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.fintechideasfestival.com/">FinTech Ideas Festival</a></span> and built that out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To take a step back, I think it’s important for us (and for our CEOs and companies) to be thinking about the future at the confluence of finance innovation and technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think that one of the things that’s important for our members to understand is what is going to be reshaping our civilization in the next 10 years. Here we are, at a moment in time, where technology is accelerating so rapidly. Pick up a copy of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Fourth Industrial Revolution</span>, a very interesting book by Klaus Schwab that really talks about how rapidly the change is happening.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’ll just give you a quick example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you look at the first industrial revolution, the spindle is the symbol of it, where you can rapidly turned wool into a thread. It took about 150 years for that innovation, the spindle, to transverse the globe so that everyone had access to it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What you’re talking on right now is probably a smartphone, a hand-held device that people in Kenya are using to make micropayments. It appeared in the marketplace about ten years ago. Technology is accelerating at a pace that is unprecedented in human history, and that’s reshaping our civilization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What we should be understanding and thinking about is a series of forces that are coming together to make that change happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think Internet of things by itself is sort of interesting. You can connect your stove, and your refrigerator, and your car, and your house, and everything else to the Internet gradually. It gets a little bit more interesting when you can capture all of that with big data. What brings it all together and makes it the most interesting is this advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When you can act on that data in real time with human-like responses, that’s going to be completely transformative for how we live, how we work, how we take out capital. I think that that’s something I want our members to really be thinking about, and to be working on, and certainly to be considering for their small business borrowers.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">As you know well, that concept is really core to what Fundbox does and what makes us unique is how we action all that data that’s out there. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I think</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> the ethical concerns around </span><span style="font-style: italic;">all this data are interesting, too, since</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> we </span><span style="font-style: italic;">want to </span><span style="font-style: italic;">use this technology to build a better worl</span><span style="font-style: italic;">d.</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Do you have any thoughts to share about how we can create this technologically</span><span style="font-style: italic;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">fueled innovation while keeping those concerns in mind?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Absolutely. We’re already there. Our member companies are at the forefront of providing financial services products to small businesses that are underserved.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You look at what happened after the financial crisis, and you can see that banks withdrew from their branches in rural areas and in inner cities based on risk. They really pulled back on their lending and tightened credit. We were there in the gap to fill that credit gap for those that might not have the most pristine credit, and to offer them access to capital. That is borne out in the research data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We released our NDP analytics report not that long ago, and it shows that about a quarter of all the dollars that we lend as an industry between 2015 and 2017, which was $10 billion, went to micro-businesses, with less than $100,000 revenue. A full third of those dollars went to low and moderate-income borrowers in low and moderate income ZIP codes. That’s an incredible piece of financial inclusion.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">That is an impressive amount. Could you comment on the larger impact this has, on our economy as a whole?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>SS:</strong> There are a lot of people who are concerned that we may end up in a world where this is shutting down access to capital for individuals. Our feeling is just the opposite. Our experience is just the opposite. Women-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses&#8230;we are absolutely there for them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of the things that distinguishes us in this industry from others is that we do small business rather than consumer lending. There’s a critical distinction there. The small business lenders, we’re lending dollars for hiring people, for increasing your revenue streams, for buying inventory that you are going to sell. Borrowing from our members is intended to show return on investment, that’s why they’re borrowing. This is not to refinance credit card debt. This is not to buy that big flat-screen TV as consumers would tend to do, this is return on investment for the economy, for the American economy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our research showed that out of that $10 billion that we’d lent between 2015 and 2017, we created about 358,911 jobs nationwide based on those dollars lent. That’s a pretty significant impact. Every dollar that we lent on average produced $2.31 worth of increased sales revenue for our small business borrowers. That’s an incredible value to them, and is improving their lives every day.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">What do you think that small business owners should understand or know about the regulations that govern this industry?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Small business owners are protected by lending laws, and we are subject to them. Anyone operating with a bank partnership of any kind is also subject to all of the regulations of those financial institutions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There is a significant level of protection here for the small business borrower. There is a difference in sophistication, inclination, desire, and results for small business borrowers versus consumers. The vast majority of consumer online lending is to refinance credit card debts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That makes sense, but it’s consumptive lending. For us, the vast majority of the lending we’re doing like all the lending is to increase the business, solve the problem, increase the revenues, hire people. We’re providing an opportunity to increase growth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That’s an important distinction for us to understand.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Turning to the future, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">do you have any</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> predictions to share about what we’re going to see in this industry in the future</span><span style="font-style: italic;">?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> I think there’ll be some consolidation in the industry. Some of the experimental algorithms that are not working, or models that don’t make sense, will go away, which will improve the overall marketplace.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think that there’ll also be an increase in automation. You’re going to see more ability to price risk without human engagement of any kind based on all of the data sources available. Those rapid advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence are going to accelerate and continue.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally, I think you’ll see some of our member companies find a way to either apply for a FinTech charter, apply for an industrial loan charter, or even a full bank charter. I would expect that some companies out there are likely to look a lot more like banks that are technology-driven in the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I believe banks should be partnering with FinTech firms to capture their agility, their technology, their view to the future, their ability to price risk rapidly. Banks have the same incentive to underwrite a $10,000 that they do $1 million loan. It’s the same process, and it’s manual. There’s a lot of paper passing back and forth, and it goes on for 60 to 90 days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For a small business borrower, that doesn’t make any sense. That cannot work and it cannot operate. They need access to capital in real time. We can function as the technology partner for banks to get access to and serve that marketplace. I expect that we will.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thank you Scott. This has been a really enlightening conversation and we appreciate all the work that you do. This is a really exciting time for our industry.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SS</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Yes, thank you. This is an exciting time for small business borrowers. They’re getting the chance to build their businesses at speed and scale that they could not have dreamed of a mere 10 years ago before the ascent of this online lending industry. That is going to accelerate.</p>

If not, there are good reasons to start.</p>
<p>Mobile payment apps have become commonplace in the B2C world, but they aren’t just for retail stores or food trucks. Accepting mobile payments can help a wide range of small businesses (including B2B companies) save time, reduce hassles, and get paid faster.</p>
<p>Here are some situations where mobile payments can benefit your business:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re displaying your products at a tradeshow and attendees want to place orders. With mobile payments, you can take their payment on the spot.</li>
<li>You visit a client&#8217;s office to finish up a big project. Use your mobile device to collect the balance of your payment right there instead of going back to the office and mailing an invoice.</li>
<li>Your construction company needs to purchase materials for the next phase of a project. With your mobile device, you can take a payment, have the funds in your bank account quickly, and purchase the products you need without waiting for a check to clear.</li>
<li>You deliver a shipment of products to a customer. Use a mobile device to get paid on delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">B2B and Mobile Payments</span></h3>
<p>The B2B world has been slower to embrace mobile payment technology than consumer-facing businesses. However, that&#8217;s starting to change as people come to expect the same speed and convenience in their business transactions as in their personal transactions.</p>
<p>Some businesspeople are even embracing mobile wallets such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay for business purchases. Mobile wallet apps store your credit or debit card information on your smartphone so you can pay without swiping a card. The global mobile payments market is expected to grow by over 33% annually, reaching nearly $3.4 billion by 2022, according to a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/mobile-payments-market">2017 report by Allied Market Research</a></span>.</p>
<p>Have a customer who still prefers to pay by check? That&#8217;s OK: You can still use your mobile devices to get plain old paper checks into your bank account faster. Just download your business bank’s mobile app. Mobile Remote Deposit Capture (mRDC) technology enables you to take a picture of a check using that app and deposit it without a trip to the bank.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobile Payment Solutions</span></h3>
<p>If you want to accept payment cards or mobile wallet payments on the go, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.squareup.com">Square</a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.payanywhere.com/">PayAnywhere</a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">PayPal Here</a></span>, and<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://paysimple.com/">QuickBooks Payments</a></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>are some of the most popular.</p>
<p>All of these options work essentially the same way:  After you sign up, the provider sends you a mobile card reader that attaches to your mobile device. You can use it to swipe payment cards, accept EMV chip cards or accept mobile wallet payments. As with any type of merchant account, you will pay a small fee for each transaction.</p>
<p>Here are some things to consider when choosing your mobile payment solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a limit on the number of payments you can accept per month? If you won&#8217;t be using the solution very often, this may not be a problem.</li>
<li>What are the fees per transaction? Generally, you&#8217;ll pay more per transaction if you do fewer transactions or if you choose a pay-as-you-go option. If you subscribe to an annual plan or as the number of transactions increase, your fees will typically go down.</li>
<li>What is included in the plan? For example, do you get a mobile device and accessories, or just the card reader?</li>
<li>How easy is the app to learn and use? You want something your employees will embrace and use in the field.</li>
<li>Does the mobile payment solution integrate with your accounting software?</li>
<li>Are there any additional features such as invoicing tools or e-commerce capability?</li>
</ul>
<p>For a small business owner, getting paid in a timely fashion is the key to success. Mobile payment solutions are one way you can help speed up the process.</p>
<p>Aside from being mobile-friendly when it comes to payments, you&#8217;ll want to make sure your business website is <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/mobile-friendly-site/">mobile friendly for visitors.</a></p>

As the fastest growing chain of bike “shops” in North America, and ranked the second-fastest growing mobile franchise by Entrepreneur Magazine, they rely on franchise management software to keep track of their entire operation.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways franchise management software helps mobile franchises like Velofix stay organized and enjoy steady growth.</p>
<h2>1. Centralized Online Booking</h2>
<p>One of the biggest sources of overhead for a mobile franchise is the booking process. The old way of phone bookings or back-and-forth via email is time-consuming and requires a lot of human effort on both sides. What’s more, admin staff do not always have an opportunity to sell a full suite of services to customers, unless they take care to list all of the options and pricing.</p>
<p>With centralized online booking, mobile franchises like Velofix leave it to the customer to do the booking. They start by choosing their location, which matches the booking with a local franchisee. Then they select the services they want, a la carte, and have transparent price quotes instantly.</p>
<h2>2. System-Wide, Multi-Location Scheduling</h2>
<p>As part of the online booking process, individual franchisees set their availability based on their work schedules, franchise territory and ZIP codes. When customers choose their bookings, the schedules for the franchisee gets completed “on the fly.” If they prefer to service certain areas of town of certain days of the week, they set their availability accordingly, and the customer chooses the appointment themselves.</p>
<h2>3. Simpler Administration for Franchisor and Franchisees</h2>
<p>All of this convenience of online booking and scheduling means a huge savings of time for the franchisors and franchisees alike. This leaves plenty of margin on the table. Instead of requiring team members at each location working on bookings, the jobs appear on the calendar for them, and they can focus on completing the jobs. “We estimate that online booking has saved us nearly 90% of job booking costs, versus if we had to handle those same job bookings via our Customer Care team,” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.vonigo.com/velofix-using-franchise-management-software/">says Velofix Co-Founder Boris Martin</a></span>.</p>
<p>This kind of proven model also allows for scalable growth of franchises. When franchisors can offer turnkey solutions that include booking and scheduling, it’s much easier for new franchisees to see the value and buy in.</p>
<h2>4. Paperless Invoicing and Automated Billing</h2>
<p>When a job is complete, the franchisee can “check out” or mark the job as complete on their mobile device. Then they can either accept payment on site, or instantly send an invoice via email containing a payment link. In either case, the process is paperless and tracked in the records of both the franchisor and franchisee.</p>
<h2>5. Measurement of Key Metrics, Franchise-Wide</h2>
<p>Not only can the franchisee have a detailed record of their sales performance, but head office can too. And the measurement options don’t stop there. Jobs per rep, jobs per day, revenue per job, and myriad other reports can be accessed by the local owner/operators and the master franchisor. With dozens of  different metrics being measured, any opportunities or weaknesses can be identified and addressed.</p>
<p>The conveniences of franchise management software are many, making it an obvious choice for mobile franchises. It’s a decision that pays off in decreased overhead, better time management, and transparent tracking of performance for the entire organization.</p>

When you want to make a deposit, do you walk into your local bank branch with a paper passbook and speak to a teller like your grandparents did? Or, do you use an app on your smartphone to take a photo of a check and deposit it remotely? If you’re like 62% of Americans, you’re taking advantage of digital banking in some form.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a financial expert to notice that the banking industry is changing. In recent years, that change has accelerated, with the advent of ubiquitous internet, smartphones, and mobile banking.</p>
<p>One interesting fact we&#8217;ve observed is that it&#8217;s not just big banks or huge companies driving the biggest changes; it&#8217;s individual consumers.</p>
<p>It turns out that, as individuals, we&#8217;re all a lot more powerful than we might think. Individual consumers and their increasingly loud demands for better, faster, and more user-friendly banking experiences that driven huge changes in the industry, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>This week, Fundbox&#8217;s Sebastian Rymarz examines this idea in Forbes, in his article, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/05/03/how-customer-demands-have-pushed-finance-to-evolve/#3fa7ea8e32bc">How Consumer Demands Have Pushed Finance to Evolve</a>.</p>
