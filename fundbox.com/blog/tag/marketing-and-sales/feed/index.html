While the buzz of “going green” may have faded a bit in recent years, the reasons to celebrate Earth Day and have an earth-friendly business are more important than ever. Earth Day is the perfect time to review your small business’s operating plan with an environmentally conscious eye and see where you may be able to make changes that will not only help your business’s bottom line, but help the environment, too. Here are a few areas to consider.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Become more energy-efficient</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making your commercial office, home office, or retail shop more energy-efficient isn’t as difficult as it may seem. It may only require small tweaks to things you are already doing. Some possibilities include changing out regular light bulbs with their energy-efficient counterparts, using power-saving settings on office computers, and upgrading to a programmable thermostat. For more ideas and a checklist to help you execute efficiency in your business, download the </span><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/tools/ENERGYSTAR_Small_Business_AWB_Main_508_November_2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENERGY STAR® Action Workbook for Small Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Go paperless</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10655-paperless-office.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going paperless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — or even moving to a more “paper-reduced” business — comes with significant environmental benefits while saving money for your business. With the cloud-based technology we have today, going paperless is no longer unachievable. In fact, you probably already have a good deal of the technology needed for a paperless office in place. With some changes, such as moving all contracts and invoicing to a secure online platform, you can slowly move your business closer to a paperless state.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Allow telecommuting</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecommuting is good for the environment, saves your employees money, and reduces overhead expenses in your business — and </span><a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20over%20the%20past,and%20are%2047%25%20more%20productive."><span style="font-weight: 400;">productivity increases </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when employees work remotely. The past couple of years have necessitated a work-from-home status for many of us, and now both employers and employees are anticipating this trend will continue. If it works in your business, you can create a telecommuting policy that allows your employees to work remotely on a part-time basis. Offering this type of benefit can even help you attract and retain talent in your business.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Set the expectations for your team</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going green only works with consistent effort from everyone on your team, so you need to get your entire staff on board. Set office-wide rules for recycling, conserving energy by shutting off lights, and guidelines for purchasing supplies and working with vendors. You may also want to give your employees a chance to weigh in and offer their own suggestions for creating an earth-friendly office. You can even consider offering an incentive for the best green idea for the office or an award to one employee a month who goes above and beyond in improving the eco-consciousness of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business — and the environment — will get the most benefit when you focus on implementing these ideas all year long, so celebrate Earth Day and use it as a catalyst for creating your “go green” plan. Start rolling out environmentally friendly changes in your business this year!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dust in the attic hasn’t even settled on your holiday decorations before retailers are stocking their shelves with Valentine&#8217;s Day cards and candy. You may dismiss Valentine’s Day as a Hallmark holiday that’s best suited for restaurants, florists, and jewelers. So what does it have to do with your B2B service or startup business? Plenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social holidays—such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, and Halloween—are a great way to engage current clients and potential customers. Sure, there may be people in your audience who don’t celebrate these holidays, but the risk of losing a few email subscribers or social media followers is largely outweighed by the potential engagement you could get from these social moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few clever ways to take advantage of social holidays to help drive engagement and connect with your clients.</span></p>
<h3><b>Send snail mail</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday cards aren’t just for December. Spread mid-year cheer with physical cards sent via the postal service. Wish your clients a happy Valentine’s Day and let them know you appreciate their business. For a bonus, include a handwritten note. Writing something personalized can be very impactful, leaving your clients feeling special long after they’ve opened the envelope. A personalized message can also help you impress that elusive client who has been on the cusp of handing you their business. Let them know you care, and you could end up winning their business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Create a seasonal website page</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give clients and potential new customers a reason to visit your website. For a small fee you can hire a web developer to create a seasonal landing page, reengaging customers and creating new interest in your page. Web developers can also create a holiday-themed game on your website where users can click on hearts or candy to win discounts or prizes. Send out an email that directs clients and prospects to your updated page or newly added game, and you’re sure to see an uptick in visits to your site—inevitably reminding visitors what services you offer and why they might need your business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Engage on social media</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social holidays are a great way to engage with users on social media. Make sure you insert yourself into the Valentine’s Day conversation by using hashtags and posting holiday-themed content that’s relevant to your business. You can even ask your customers what they’re doing to celebrate, using the holiday to drive engagement and create conversation with your customer base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take it a step further? You can update your business’ banner or social media logo to coincide with the theme of the holiday. While it may seem simple, this update will let your followers know that you’re active on the platform. Just make sure to revert your banner and logo back once the holiday is over so you don’t appear to be inactive and the channels don’t seem neglected.</span></p>
<h3><b>Run a marketing campaign</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company is ready to take on new business, using holiday-themed content in a marketing email or social media post will instantly make your messaging seem timely and relevant. This is a great way to repurpose existing content and to freshen up old messaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can reach out to customers to wish them a happy Valentine’s Day, and while you’re at it, you can remind them of the great services you offer or any promotions you have going on. Holidays are a great way to “break the ice” of a cold email, and it can make your brand seem more personable and relatable, too. </span></p>
<h3><b>Support your customers, employees, or ‌charity </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday doesn’t necessarily have to be about driving business. Instead of pushing clients to engage in your services, you can use holidays as an opportunity to give back. Maybe you can budget in a small gift or discount for each of your clients. In addition to being a nice treat, it also gives clients a reason to reach out once the holiday has passed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also consider using the holiday as an employee appreciation day, bringing in a little sweet treat to let your employees know how much you care. If you do treat your team, make sure you capture it on social media. It’s a great chance to show your customers a behind-the-scenes view of what it’s like inside your company—giving them the warm and fuzzies, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to spread the love this Valentine’s Day is by creating a small online fundraiser for your favorite charity or organizing a blanket or toy drive for a local animal shelter. Bonus points if you choose a charity or cause that is related to your business, giving your current and potential customers yet another reason to enjoy doing business with you.</span></p>

If you’re not prepared for downtime, you can lose cash flow, customers, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are practical ways to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-important-steps-to-running-a-successful-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set your business up for success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here are six steps to take to prepare for your slow season: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Organize your finances</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business’s financial situation is key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping your operation alive when cash is tight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you have a clear picture of your cash flow, annual sales forecast, and expenses, you can create a more realistic budget and allocate your spending to the right expenditures. It’s a good idea to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/find-right-accountant-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet with your business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to go over the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a cash flow forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to figure out how much money you have to work with during your slow season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list of your </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;oq=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i299.3165j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and variable expenses to see what you need to save—and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-cut-expenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where you could potentially cut costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You want to ensure you have enough cash to cover your rent, business website, debt obligations, payroll, and equipment maintenance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sales or revenue forecast: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on your data from last year, estimate how much revenue you can generate during the slow period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Financing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider whether or not you need financing. You might need a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help cover ongoing operating expenses, for example, or a term loan to buy inventory in bulk before your busy season ramps up again. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Get rid of extra inventory</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inventory you carry during your business’s high season can quickly become a burden come the slow season. Depending on the products or services you offer, excess inventory either means wasted revenue potential or extra storage costs—and sometimes both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offloading extra inventory gives you the chance to earn money on slow-moving stock, make the most of products with a short lifespan, and save on storage fees and future marketing expenses. Here are a few ways to get rid of inventory ahead of a slow period:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create promotions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling items for a discount or limited time only can help you reduce inventory fast. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bundle products: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair slower-moving stock with one or two customer favorites, and sell the package for a slightly higher price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Re-market inventory:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> See if you can alter your products slightly, or market them to a different group of customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Return inventory to a supplier: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to your supplier to ask if they’ll let you exchange or return unsold inventory. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sell inventory to another business: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the type of inventory you carry, you may be able to sell extra materials, parts, or products to another business at a discounted rate. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Donate your inventory: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the value of giving away your inventory versus paying to store it. You could donate products or supplies to a nonprofit organization, a local school or shelter, or a small business that needs a boost. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Brainstorm off-season revenue streams</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can find a way to keep the cash coming in when demand is lower, you might save yourself stress during the slow season. First, consider your business model, financial goals, and bandwidth. If you have the time and resources to add another revenue stream to your business, then you can start brainstorming possibilities. Here are just a few options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Turn your service into a product: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting out a valuable product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help satisfy customers and net you a bit of extra cash. If you run a business that provides ski lessons, for example, you could create and sell an online workout guide with videos and tips to keep skiers in shape during the off-season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Experiment with a subscription model: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can bring in extra cash by giving your customers the option to sign up for a subscription. Customers could pay a monthly fee to get access to your services year-round, for example, or pay monthly in order to score discounted rates on services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Partner with other businesses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to local businesses or complementary online companies to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do cross-promotions or strategic partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sublet your business space: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t need your building, storefront, or office for a few months, try subletting it out to another business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Check in with your customers</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to maintain your business—especially before a slow period—is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-enhance-customer-experience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on customer retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After all, it’s generally easier and more affordable to keep the customers you already have than it is to find new ones. Instead of letting your customers fade into the background during your slow months, find ways to stay connected. Here are some ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Make a call: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you offer a seasonal service like yard maintenance or holiday light installation, reach out to your customers during the off-season to check in. You can ask if they need any help, or give them a discount code to use on their next service.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Keep customers in the loop: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your business’s name top of mind by sending out regular emails with promotion opportunities, industry news, or important business announcements. If you shut down your business for a certain period of time every year, make sure your customers know when you’re opening your doors again. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a loyalty program: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show customers you value their business by offering rewards and perks. You can offer discounts for referrals, or create a system where people get additional points with each purchase or service. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Make a marketing plan</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not need to allocate as much money to marketing if your business has a true off-season, but it’s still smart to have a game plan for the slower months. Consistent marketing is critical to drawing in new customers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping current ones engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To come up with an effective plan, start by laying out your budget for marketing and advertising during peak season. From there, you can work backward and see what’s realistic for the slower season. Here are just a handful of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/b2b-marketing-strategies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may want to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-businesss-instagram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-down on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to connect with customers and promote your offerings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put out content (like email newsletters, blog posts, videos, and guides) that help generate brand awareness. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a few low-cost, high-impact ad placements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend in-person events and online conferences to network and keep your business’s name out there.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Invest in business improvements </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow periods are the perfect time to invest back into your business. Even a few simple improvements can help you increase revenue, attract more customers during the busy season, and increase operational efficiency. Before you start making changes, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the next busy season and beyond. Depending on what you want to achieve, you may decide to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Streamline administrative processes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assess your internal processes and systems for efficiency and ease. To fix inconveniences or problems, you may need to organize your digital files, invest in customer relationship management software, or change payroll providers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Train your workforce: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train your employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on proper customer service and job techniques, so you can hit the ground running come busy season. You can also use this time to search for new job candidates.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your equipment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule maintenance checks for big-ticket items, like point-of-sale systems, computers, machinery, and vehicles. You may want to replace old models or research new technology and equipment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Network: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an effort to connect with business owners in your community and attend virtual or in-person industry conferences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your website: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your site a refresh: fix any bugs, update old content and information, and give your landing page a makeover. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a seasonal operation can be challenging, but with a little planning and preparation, you can thrive all year long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need working capital to get through a slow period or take advantage of a busy one, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out Fundbox’s line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

But this is no time for laggards. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more people working from home, boosting your online presence is critical. Just look at webinars, </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/39-of-people-attended-more-webinars-or-webcasts-in-2020-than-in-years-before-301242351.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39% more people attended online events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 than in prior years. And the </span><a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/10/emarketer-us-b2b-digital-ad-spend-soars-226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B2B business outlook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2021 and 2022 suggests that marketers will continue to accelerate digital growth with search, virtual events, podcasts, and LinkedIn replacing traditional marketing tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many digital channels and brands competing for attention, where should you focus your B2B online marketing strategy and efforts? Here are four areas that you may want to consider as part of your digital marketing mix.</span></p>
<h2>Use online content to inform, engage, and influence</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In B2B business marketing, content is king. Sharing valuable and relevant information online such as blogs, videos, infographics, webinars, podcasts, and eBooks, can help inform customers while building trust and engagement. Custom content is so powerful that </span><a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of CMOs view it as the future of marketing. People also feel more positive about a business after reading its shared content. </span><a href="https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content also generates leads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—three-times as much as traditional marketing and at a lower cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any content marketing must be backed up by strategy. Consider your goals. Do you want to drive more traffic to your website, elevate your brand through thought leadership, reach new audiences, or generate leads? Your content should also be informed by your audience and the kind of content they respond to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan your strategy, it’s important to develop content for each stage of the B2B sales funnel—awareness (infographics and blogs), evaluation (white papers, case studies and eBooks), conversion (demos, webinars, and testimonials), loyalty and advocacy (podcasts, blogs, etc.). Finally, have a plan to promote your B2B content through email, social marketing, and earned and paid media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, be prepared to commit time and resources to producing quality content. Prospects and customers respond to better content over more content.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out this blog for more tips on </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/content-marketing-local-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content marketing for local businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Automate your email campaigns</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may seem old school, but email continues to dominate B2B marketing and is a great way to boost your online efforts.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that 87% of B2B marketers use email to share digital content and nurture and convert leads. And for good reason. Email delivers a captive audience—subscribers have opted in to receive your updates in their inbox. Unlike most social media, you can personalize your messages and measure the response. The ROI is also significant. For every $1 spent on email marketing, business can expect </span><a href="http://emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an average return of $38</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you automate your email campaigns, you can take your business to the next level and convert a prospect to a customer. Any business can map out an email sequence that drives engagement and conversion. For instance, when a prospect subscribes to your email list or fills in a form on your website, start a dialog with them. Your first auto-generated email should introduce your company, describe what makes you unique, and offer a reason why the subscriber should stay engaged (tease them with information about the kind of content and offers you plan to share). Always include a call to action such as schedule an appointment, a free assessment, or something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your second email (automatically sent three-four days later) can dive deeper into the services you offer and the problems you solve. You could point to an online asset like an eBook or white paper that explains how you solve customer pain points. Again, include a call to action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that your subscriber knows a little more about you, focus the final email in the sequence solely on your special offer or promotion and make it time bound. Give your prospects a reason to take action today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t stop there. Automated email campaigns can also be used after a purchase to glean feedback, upsell, cross sell, share content, and keep the engagement going. </span></p>

<h2>Invest in B2B social media marketing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media isn’t just for B2C marketing, it’s a powerful tool for advertising, brand-building, customer engagement, and lead generation. Yet many B2B brands struggle with social media whether through a lack of content, not knowing how to effectively engage with audiences, or what options they have for doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take LinkedIn for example. The platform continues to be the most effective social network for business and accounts for </span><a href="https://www.brafton.com/blog/strategy/11-exciting-b2b-marketing-trends-you-need-to-know-for-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over half of all B2B traffic and 80% of leads,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but LinkedIn has more to offer than its newsfeed. The LinkedIn InMail feature lets brands deliver informative and promotional emails to a targeted list of LinkedIn members. This is a great way to reach new audiences, by job title and industry. Executives can also establish thought leadership through LinkedIn articles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little-known feature of LinkedIn is </span><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This streaming video service lets brands broadcast live content to the platform and attracts a much higher engagement than native broadcasting. Use it to launch new products, spotlight employees, demonstrate expertise, or promote an event. You can also tap the power of your business’ network with </span><a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2020/may/12/tapping-into-the-power-of-your-professional-network-with-polls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn Polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a great way to get to know your followers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, LinkedIn has a lot to offer B2B brands, but which social media is best for B2B? Other channels add value too, especially when it comes to branding. To help you decide, look at what your competitors are doing. If they’re having success on Twitter or YouTube, then you can too.  </span></p>
<h2>Enhance your SEO efforts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization (SEO) can seem like a daunting practice but it’s invaluable for promoting your B2B business online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done well, SEO ensures your website has a strong search ranking. The higher you rank on Google and Bing, the more traffic your website will receive. It can be tempting to invest in paid SEO (where you pay when someone clicks on your ad next to a search result), but organic search could generate better dividends. For every click on a paid search result, </span><a href="https://moz.com/blog/via-enquisite-ppc-agencies-make-45x-what-seos-do-for-the-same-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">organic search generates 8.5 clicks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key to this conversion rate is content. High quality, long-form content (which creates more opportunity for the inclusion of key words) is ranked higher by search engines. Informative website product copy sprinkled with keywords and phrases can also help you rank better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfecting SEO takes time, but as you produce more content and other sites link to that content (known as back linking) your ranking and site traffic will increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re new to SEO, here are some useful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-b2b-seo-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tips for increasing B2B SEO traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="black businesswoman at wallboard planning marketing strategy" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your team have worked tirelessly for years, developing innovative products or services to fulfill the needs of other small businesses (in your own specific niche and beyond). You’ve even created—and deployed—</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a robust marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are using a whole host of proven B2B marketing tactics in your quest to turn promising leads into loyal clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge? Competition is fierce, so sticking to basic marketing tactics isn’t always enough. If the goal is to generate more B2B sales among new and existing clients, it may be time to harness some of that same creative energy you used to revolutionize your industry’s offerings in the first place to take your small business’s marketing strategy to the next level (thanks to the pandemic, you may be planning to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update your overall digital marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anyway—so the time to do think specifically about B2B marketing has never been better).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are four innovative B2B marketing strategies your small business can use now to build client relationships, increase sales, and stand out in the crowd. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customize the client experience with augmented reality </span><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, with a large portion of the workforce conducting business at home rather than in an office, it is harder and harder to get your products in front of would-be clients so they can actually see and experience the benefits firsthand before making a purchase. The antidote to this? It&#8217;s an interactive technology called </span><a href="https://www.fi.edu/what-is-augmented-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike virtual reality, which places the user in a virtual environment, AR places a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">user’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environment. This allows said user to visualize, in detail, how the product might appear/function within their own workspace before they actually make the purchase. Picture a coffee shop owner, for example, “trying out” a new espresso machine virtually as a way to determine whether it actually fits in the allotted space, or a business manager doing the same with a multifunction copy machine. If your business is one that offers product customization, AR allows you to customize virtually so clients can see what something might look like with these customizations before making a commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An almost </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 billion (and growing) global industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AR is conducted with a smartphone or tablet camera, in conjunction with a web browser and special AR software. The downside to AR? The cost to implement the technology varies significantly based on whether you build your AR tools in-house using a DIY app or hire a pro to design custom software—so be aware that it may be cost-prohibitive for some small businesses, depending on needs and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>AR is one of several</i> </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective marketing tools for B2C ecommerce businesses</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. If you’ve ever shopped for a car online or visited a virtual dressing room to try on jeans, you’ve probably seen it.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiment with long-form content</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you’ve heard that blog content is supposed to be short, punchy and straight to the point. While this may have been true at one time, research actually indicates that long-form content </span><a href="https://www.semrush.com/ebooks/state-of-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets shared three times more than short-form content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to earn a first-page ranking on Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask, what does this have to do with innovation? Despite these stats, long-form content hasn’t really caught on yet in the B2B world. As of 2020, only </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38% of marketers in the B2B space were using it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Content Marketing Institute. You’ll be ahead of the curve if you start incorporating long-form content into your content marketing plan now, before it becomes commonplace.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of content can be long-form?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-form content is characterized primarily by length. CMI defines it as </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2020/04/long-form-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any piece of content in the 2-3K word range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (anything above and beyond that is considered “extra-long”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of long-form marketing content include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case studies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White papers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-books</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guides/tutorials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillar pages (in-depth and lengthy, with lots of links to related content) </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equip your website with real-time personalization</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200311005240/en/Folloze-Research-B2B-Marketing-Sales-Teams-Link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 survey of B2B sales and marketing professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that more than half of respondents believe personalization in marketing leads to “higher conversion rates.” At the same time, a considerable portion of them (42%) reported struggling to incorporate personalization into their B2B marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the struggling-to-incorporate camp, now may be the time to really dive into the process of figuring out how to use personalization in your B2B marketing strategy because, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2019 report by McKinsey and Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is expected to be the “prime deliverer of marketing success” by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One innovative way to make this happen? Through the use of automated tools that customize your website content for each unique set of visitors, otherwise known as real-time personalization (this is just one of many types of personalization in B2B marketing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, with real-time personalization, your website uses IP addresses, locations and domains to instinctively recognize where various visitors are coming from. Then, it shows these visitors text and images that are most relevant to their businesses (in the form of products, informational blog posts, event announcements, etc.) while simultaneously weeding out content that is less likely to pique their interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may sound complicated and expensive, you’re in luck—it doesn’t have to be. Many automated personalization tools, such as</span><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize-360/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Optimize 360</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are competitively priced or, in some cases, even free. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a podcast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week, </span><a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68 million Americans listen to podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While comedy is the most popular genre (no surprise there), plenty of people are interested in listening to informative business and educational podcasts, hosted and/or created by leaders in their respective fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this adds up to an enormous and potentially game-changing opportunity for you as a small business owner. For one thing, while podcasts are certainly growing in popularity, the market is nowhere near saturated—especially in niche areas like B2B (</span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/why-podcasting-matters-to-marketing-infographic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to one source, collectively a mere 3% of marketing pros were podcasting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of March 2020).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasting is also:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple to navigate, with fewer constraints on access compared to some other media channels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable (you can create a podcast without a large financial investment)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to establish credibility as a subject matter expert in your field</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450637/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for branding and relationship-building purposes</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A way to generate ad revenue</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to discuss on a B2B podcast? Keep in mind that podcasting is really just an extension of your existing content marketing efforts, so refer to your existing content for inspiration. You can also interview important figures in your field, share company news, discuss the history of your business&#8217;s niche, really anything at all that your clients (and potential clients) might enjoy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics indicate that business owners are taking advantage of Instagram’s clout—</span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of businesses use Instagram to at least some degree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Perhaps more importantly, </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of Instagram </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">users</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning consumers with personal Instagram accounts) turn to the platform for information on products and services before making a purchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes everything from doing research on products and services to getting the particulars on promotions and sales to finding links to websites and contact information. All add up to a potential goldmine for small business owners interested in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updating their digital marketing campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proven e-commerce strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply being on Instagram (e.g. signing up for an </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram business account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) isn’t going to get you very far, though. You need to actually use it in a way that will pay off. How can you do this? Multiple factors are involved, but one of the most important factors involves your followers. Not only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is following you (although that can be important, too), but how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are following you as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does it matter? That’s because followers beget </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">followers, along with more shares, more visibility and ultimately (hopefully!) more sales. Learning how to gather followers isn’t necessarily instinctive, but once you know the ropes it will feel like second nature. Do you have just a handful of followers, or are you working with a sizable list of actively engaged folks who regularly view your posts?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is the former, here are four actions you can take now to increase the number of your small business’s Instagram followers:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Use hashtags strategically and effectively</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hashtag may appear to be nothing other than a random word or phrase with a pound sign in front of it. In reality, hashtags are your business’s best friend—at least in terms of getting an influx of Instagram followers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the purpose of hashtags?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashtags provide a chance to connect your business to a cause relevant to your brand, a promotional opportunity or a trending topic by catapulting a post into the search results related to said hashtags so your business is easier to find (the sheer volume of content on Instagram means a lot of great posts get buried without them). When an Instagram user enters a search term preceded by a hashtag into the search field, posts that include that hashtag will appear (coffee connoisseurs may search for #espresso, whereas someone planning a vacation may search for #travel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you can research hashtags that apply to your business and include them in your Instagram posts to increase the potential for views, likes and additional followers (examples include hashtags like #nationalsmallbusinessweek or #smallbusiness). You can also create custom hashtags for special events (like a seasonal sale), and advise customers to search for and follow those hashtags on Instagram.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many hashtags should you use?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of hashtags you use in a post is all up to you, and that decision will depend greatly on the hashtag protocols in your industry. Instagram’s hashtag limit is 30 per post. You certainly don’t need to take it that far if you don’t want to, but you may want to consider using at least one—</span><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/instagram-stats-every-marketer-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data supports the idea that posts with hashtags receive more consumer engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than those without. The sweet spot? Around five hashtags per post.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: To help establish brand recognition, create a hashtag specific to your business name and/or brand and encourage followers to use it when mentioning your business in posts.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Invest in Instagram ads</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never considered capitalizing on the power of </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now may be the time to give it a try if one of your objectives is to gain more followers. Often more affordable than traditional forms of advertising, like radio or print, Instagram offers a lot of flexibility in terms of how you format your ad. You can take an existing post and morph it into an ad, you can produce ads in Instagram Stories, you can create shoppable posts and so on. </span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/how-much-does-social-media-advertising-cost.html#instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost to you, as the advertiser, is click- or impression-based and varies a lot depending on several factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do ads help increase your follower count? Instagram uses algorithms and data to target folks who show interest in products or services like yours, even if they aren’t already following you. As they scroll, your ad appears. Not all will follow you but, thanks to targeting, some probably will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Tip: Another advertising option?</i> </span><a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-sponsored-posts/#:~:text=An%20Instagram%20sponsored%20post%20is,account%20for%20a%20lucrative%20career." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored posts</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This involves partnering with (i.e. paying) an influencer to promote your products or services in their own posts or stories. Because their followers presumably consider them a credible source, their endorsement may result in more followers for you.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Host contests and giveaways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram users love contests and giveaways and, as a small business with an Instagram business account, it may be worth your time to sponsor one. Why? Because a contest/giveaway provides an opportunity to quickly and easily gain followers. Contests and giveaways also allow you to engage with your current followers in a way that encourages them to help you spread the word about your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting one up isn’t hard. It all starts with determining what it is you want to give away and setting contest parameters (be aware that </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/179379842258600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram has several rules about contests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you’ll need to adhere to). Since your goal is to gain followers, however, you’ll want to make sure that those parameters help get you there.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few ideas:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage followers to tag a friend for an additional contest entry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the contest open to followers only.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborate on the contest with another business or influence (cross promotion for the win). </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Engage with followers (and potential followers)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you do this yourself, maybe you hire a social media manager to do it or maybe you assign the task to an employee. In any case, one of the best ways to increase your Instagram following is to actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram as the communication tool that it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This starts, of course, with posting regularly, but it doesn’t end there. You also need to make sure your followers know you actually see and hear them. How?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reply to their comments, questions and concerns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone tags your business in a post, thank them in the comments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow them back—especially those that like and/or comment on your posts regularly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comment on other users’ posts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regram” (i.e. share) posts that you think may interest your followers (unlike Facebook and other social media apps, Instagram doesn’t make this easy—</span><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/how-to-repost-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll need to use a third-party app or take a screenshot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to share another account’s post).</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re hoping to attract new customers, retain existing ones, expand your resources, and increase your reach and revenue, keep reading for some helpful small business strategy options. While every strategy might not work for your business, hopefully they’ll give you an idea of how you can make your business stand out amongst the crowd. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create business and marketing plans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best strategies for small business owners hoping to achieve business growth is a simple one, create a business plan and a marketing plan. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing a business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to map out your goals so that you can stay on track to meet them. A strong business plan contains the following sections:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive summary</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company description</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descriptions of offerings and value propositions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and sales strategies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial info</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appendix (optional)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to making sure people actually know about your offerings and figuring out how to promote your business, you’ll want to consider creating a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your small business. Develop a marketing plan that outlines what your marketing goals are, what steps you intend to take to meet them, and what your budget looks like so that you know exactly how to promote your business and can cut out any guesswork. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get social with customers and clients</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While social media gets all the attention these days in the marketing world, there are plenty of ways to get social with your customers and clients that go far past tweeting. Yes, most businesses will want to have a robust social media strategy in place. Social media is a great way to update your audience about new product launches, sales and promotions, and can be a fun and easy way to engage with your clients or customers on an ongoing basis. Marketers have found that social media marketing can lead to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/188447/influence-of-global-social-media-marketing-usage-on-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased exposure, improved traffic, better lead generation, and growing fan loyalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that being said, you should also find ways to connect with your audience outside of social media. Virtual networking events, live webinars, and in-person events (once social distancing restrictions lift), are all great ways to connect with your clients and customers who are interested in learning more about your products and services. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your customer service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’re talking about getting social, </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/363182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investing in your customer service offerings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to build loyalty and keep customers happy. Create an effective customer service strategy that is responsive (you don’t want to keep them waiting for long), have solutions readily in place for common issues (like missing deliveries), and make sure that all of your customer service staff interact with your customers in a way that represents your company’s culture and values. As </span><a href="https://c1.sfdcstatic.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/research/salesforce-state-of-the-connected-customer-4th-ed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported they would forgive a company for making a mistake after receiving excellent customer service, it’s easy to see how investing in customer service can pay off big time. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide valuable content </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About </span><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of marketers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that content marketing is an extremely important part of their marketing strategy. Why are marketers so crazy about content marketing? This form of marketing does exactly what it sounds like, it relies on content. Generally, this term refers to web-based content such as blog posts, e-guides, and other content you can host on your businesses’ website. Content serves multiple purposes that can help a business meet their goals, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Growing brand loyalty. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business, your main goal is to earn revenue. However you don’t want to always be asking your customers to make purchases. To build brand loyalty, it can be helpful to give them something for free. Creating valuable and engaging content for your audience encourages them to come to you at times other than when they need to spend money. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Increasing SEO hits</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The more content you have hosted on your website, the better chance that curious searchers will end up on your website after typing their query into a search engine. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Boosting your social and email presence. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want something besides advertisements and sales pitches to put in your email newsletters and social posts? Content gives you something fun or useful to promote that can help space out your pushes for purchases. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Building your authority. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want your customer base to respect you as an expert in your field? Providing top notch resources on your subject matter via content can help you build your reputation as an authoritative player in your industry. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your revenue streams</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what they say about putting all of your eggs in one basket—don’t. When it comes to business, </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/363182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">having multiple streams of revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (such as selling various products or offering more than one service) can help you increase interest in your brand and can accommodate the natural ebb and flow of revenue your products and services may generate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you own a company that only provides swimming lessons to children, you’ll likely struggle to generate revenue during the winter. If you add first aid classes for parents into the mix, you’ll be able to focus on that area of your business during the winter and can upsell the parents of your swimming students to take first aid classes all year round. If you already have a loyal customer base, try to come up with complimentary products and services you can offer that they’ll likely be interested in. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create strategic partnerships</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a small business on your own can be challenging, sometimes to take your business to the next level you might want to collaborate on a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic business partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help lighten your load and bring more resources to the table. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strategic business partnership occurs when two businesses agree to team up and share their resources in order to mutually benefit. Small businesses often benefit from these partnerships because they can team up with other businesses in their industry in order to gain access to a new target market or to get their hands on valuable resources. By pairing up with another business, you can compete better with larger businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three types of strategic partnerships:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint venture: This is when two companies combine their resources with the goal of meeting a certain objective. Both companies will be responsible for any costs and profits relating to this joint venture but they remain separate business entities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity strategic alliance: To make an equity strategic alliance happen, one of the companies in the strategic partnership has to actually purchase equity in the other company. In some cases, both companies in the partnership will purchase equity in each other’s companies.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-equity strategic alliance: Two or more companies sign a contract that states they agree to combine their resources in a non-equity strategic alliance. However, neither company will create a separate entity or share any equity.</span></li>
</ul>

So, why is your main competitor’s page getting all the hits while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website struggles to make it to the top of page three on Google? Are they just lucky?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at all. Search engine results have little to do with luck. Chances are, your competitor is using a variety of search engine optimization (SEO) tools, including content marketing, to drive web traffic to their page.</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in getting those page one Google results for yourself, you need to do the same.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And you need to do it more effectively than your competitors.</span></p>
<h2>What is Content Marketing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, content? But I’m a (plumber, personal trainer, attorney, real estate agent, etc.), not a writer or marketing professional. True, but as a pro in your field, you have lots of information and expertise to share with would-be customers. And this, says Greg Gifford, vice president of </span><a href="https://searchlabdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SearchLab, an SEO agency that specializes in helping small- and medium-sized businesses reach local customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the key to getting your page to pop up when someone Googles ‘plumber near me’ (for example).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Businesses) have to have better content on their site to answer the questions potential customers might be asking about products or services, to outshine competitors and look better to Google,” Gifford explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean making your home page wordier, says Gifford—it means adding content, in the form of a blog, to your website. The blog should contain “purely informational content” </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rather promotional/sales-oriented content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so you can establish yourself as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> local expert on the product or service you provide (the fact that you are a local business that wants to draw in local customers, as opposed to one with a wider geographical reach, doesn’t change anything about the content marketing you engage in other than the fact that you’ll need to use the same keywords local customers are using in searches). Even though the content isn’t written with the intent to make an immediate sale, it is likely to increase sales in the long run because readers will a) remember that they read something useful on your blog and b) return in the future with money in their pockets.</span></p>
<h2>What Type of Content Will Drive Traffic to My Website?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the type of content you post will depend directly on the type of business you are running. A plumber, for example, might post articles about how to unclog a toilet or deal with frozen pipes. An interior designer’s potential customers might like to read about how to select paint colors or how to remove wallpaper. For a coffee shop owner, articles that answer questions like “what is a macchiato?” or “can I make a latte with oat milk?” are bound to get hits. Just think about some of your industry’s most sought-after information, and go from there, says Gifford.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clincher: The content must be well-written, with plenty of strong/relevant keywords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Writing poorly-constructed content or content with grammatical and spelling errors is going to hurt you more than it will help you,” Gifford says.</span></p>
<h2>Should I Hire a Professional to do My Content Marketing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a good writer who also happens to have some basic SEO knowledge? Creating a content marketing plan and writing the content yourself is always a possibility (especially if your budget doesn’t allow you to outsource). If you decide to go this route, Gifford suggests taking some training courses rather than just winging it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are a lot of free resources out there,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, bringing a professional onboard to help create a content marketing strategy is never a bad idea. For one thing, it frees you up to focus on other things (like actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best at what you do in town, rather than writing about it). Plus, professional content marketing strategists already have all the necessary knowledge and tools at their disposal, so they can get a program implemented in a reasonable timeframe without all the roadblocks you might encounter trying to figure it out yourself for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who do you hire to help? Options include full-service SEO agencies (like Gifford’s), smaller agencies that specialize specifically in content marketing or independent/freelance content marketing experts. All are great options, as long as the folks you are working with understand SEO and analytics along with content marketing strategy.</span></p>
<h2> Using Social Media to Market Your Local Business</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether you decide to outsource your content marketing or DIY, posting content on a blog is really just the beginning of an effective content marketing strategy. You’ll miss many opportunities to market your business locally if you fail to incorporate the use of social media into the plan (because social media is one of the most effective ways to let people know your content exists, says Gifford).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are few ways to use social media as a content marketing tool:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post/share links to your content on your social media channels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with your audience on social media. If someone leaves a comment or asks a question, answer them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on the social media tools your target audience uses. TikTok sounds like fun, but is your target audience actually spending time on TikTok? If they aren’t, that isn’t a productive use of your time (at least not when it comes to advertising your local business).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, stick to channels that are well-suited to the type of business you run. A visually-oriented business, like a hair salon or a remodeling company, is a good candidate for Instagram. A plumbing service? Not so much.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t shy away from paid advertising, Gifford says, because “organic social reach is very, very low.” This means paying Facebook or Instagram, for example, to promote a post that links to your latest piece of content so that it gets in front of the audience you are trying to reach (otherwise, the link to the post you spent so much time on could fade away into Facebook oblivion).</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Do I Have to Develop a Content Marketing Strategy?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside to incorporating content marketing into your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long-term marketing plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Time and money, of course. And no, you don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do it. But it really is one of the best ways to make sure your business stands out in the crowd, says Gifford. Plus, content marketing is an advertising strategy that is growing exponentially (</span><a href="https://www.technavio.com/report/content-marketing-market-industry-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one recent report indicated that the industry is expected to grow, as a whole, by more than $250 billion between now and 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Just be sure that your content marketing strategy is, well, strategic. Know your goals, know your audience, know your keywords and search terms—all before you start creating content. Armed with that information, you’ll be well on your way to creating a plan that will draw more traffic to your website and, ultimately, more customers through your front door.</span></p>
