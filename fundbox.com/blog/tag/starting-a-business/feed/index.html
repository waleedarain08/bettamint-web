										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Startup-Business-Loans-Can-Help-Get-Your-Business-Up-and-Running.min_.min_.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve taken the leap into entrepreneurship and it’s time to figure out how to get your business up and running. You need funding to start achieving your goals. If you’re looking at financing options, a startup business loan is a great solution that allows you to build your business’s credit history, which will help you qualify for other types of credit in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional bank loans can be difficult for entrepreneurs to secure until they have a solid business history and strong business credit. Because many small businesses are underserved by banks, there are plenty of other options available to new businesses looking for financing to help them get started. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online term loans and business lines of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders can provide similar financing options to banks, including term loans and business lines of credit, with significantly streamlined application and approval processes. However, most online lenders require you to be in business for at least six months, as credit decisions are based on your financial history (as opposed to projections). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, look for lenders that offer flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and loan options for growing businesses with reasonable interest and annual percentage rates (APR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on loans from online lenders typically start at about </span><a href="https://www.nav.com/blog/what-is-the-average-business-loan-interest-rate-37650/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Also consider your repayment terms, to ensure that you can make your regularly scheduled payments without disrupting your cash flow. The more structured your repayment plan, the more likely you are to pay off your loan in time without extra financial burden. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans from local community organizations </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best places to look for funding, especially when you’re at the beginning of your business journey, is your local business and economic development organizations and nonprofit groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders like these can provide resources, education, and networking opportunities alongside financing options. They have a vested interest in helping local businesses thrive and can point you towards different funding opportunities as you expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide access to loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) as well as funds from other lending programs such as the </span><a href="http://www.toryburchfoundation.org/programs/capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory Burch Foundation Capital Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides financing for women entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and municipal business development programs also provide startup business loans, so check your local government websites for options. For example, New York state offers the </span><a href="https://esd.ny.gov/metropolitan-economic-revitalization-fund-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund (MERF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses that are creating jobs in low-income areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also many microlenders across the country who work with startups and small businesses to help them get off the ground. Microlenders like </span><a href="https://www.pacificcommunityventures.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pacific Community Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in California and </span><a href="https://www.liftfund.com/loan-offerings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LiftFund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which serves the southeastern U.S., provide access to SBA loans and other financing opportunities alongside educational resources. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset-based financing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a limited business credit history or </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/small-business/startup-business-loans-bad-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a low credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, secured, asset-based financing options like invoice factoring, merchant cash advances, and loans against specific collateral can help you get the financing you need as a startup. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of financing where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party who in turn provides a sum of cash equal to a portion of the invoice amounts. Your clients then pay their invoices to the factoring company. This type of financing works well if you already have a high volume of outstanding invoices in your accounts receivables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/merchant-cash-advance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant cash advance,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’re provided with a sum of money up front that you pay down with a percentage of your credit card sales. This financing option carries one of the highest interest rates, since it does not typically rely on your credit, but is instead based on your everyday customer credit card transactions. This option works best if your customers pay you primarily with credit cards.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-does-equipment-financing-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the best ways for new businesses to get the machinery and vehicles they need to get started because they use the equipment itself as collateral — similar to a mortgage. You can also leverage </span><a href="https://na.doosanequipment.com/en/news-stories/the-cutting-edge/buy-rent-or-lease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leasing and rent-to-own options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get the equipment you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a business owner with a low personal credit score who’s looking for financing, be wary of lenders who say that they will guarantee approval without looking at your business credit or financial standing in any capacity, as these options can turn out to be expensive or untrustworthy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also keep in mind that some lenders will perform what’s known as a </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-hard-inquiry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard inquiry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “hard pull” on your credit report that may negatively impact your credit score, potentially preventing you from securing funding. If several hard inquiries appear on your credit report in a short period of time, you may be less likely to be approved. Online lenders, including Fundbox, take a look at your financial history and only perform what’s known as a soft pull on your credit report when you apply, which will not affect your credit score. Be sure to look for lenders that offer a balance of flexibility around credit requirements and security around repayment terms and interest rates when it comes to securing financing. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) microloans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA provides </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $50,000 for small businesses to start up and expand. SBA microloans are provided by intermediary, nonprofit lenders who often have a mandate to support small businesses with a focus on minority- and women-owned businesses. This can make it easier for </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/sba-microloans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">startups and early-stage small businesses to qualify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the funding they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lenders who facilitate SBA funding will have their own terms for the loan, but interest rates are typically between 8 and 13 percent with a maximum repayment term of six years. You can use microloans for most of your business needs, including working capital, inventory, supplies, and equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Borrowers need to have a credit score of at least 640, but some lenders offer loans to borrowers with </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/sba-microloan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scores as low as 575.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proving that you have steady revenue, providing collateral, and leveraging a cosigner can help you secure a loan even if you have a low credit score. Be aware that it can take around two to three weeks or more to get approval for a microloan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans are typically easier for new businesses to obtain than the SBA 7(a) loan, a popular option for established businesses with more credit history who need up to $5 million in financing. To see if microloans are the right option for your business, you can </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/local-assistance/find?type=SBA%20District%20Office&amp;pageNumber=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search here for your local SBA office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business loans can boost long-term growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in your business will pay off as you grow. Startup business loans empower you to build a business you’re proud of with the right resources, equipment, and team members. With financing options that meet your needs, you can feel confident about taking on business debt to achieve your goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for more than six months, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify for a business line of credit from Fundbox and get financing to take your business to the next level.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Startup-Business-Funding-Where-to-Look-When-Youre-Beginning.min_.min_-768x476.png" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Startup-Business-Funding-Where-to-Look-When-Youre-Beginning" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Startup-Business-Funding-Where-to-Look-When-Youre-Beginning.min_.min_-768x476.png 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Startup-Business-Funding-Where-to-Look-When-Youre-Beginning.min_.min_.png 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old saying ‘money doesn’t grow on trees’ certainly rings true for new entrepreneurs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in three new entrepreneurs begin their small business with less than $5,000. Hatching a bright business idea is one thing, but finding the funding to bring it to life is another matter altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, money is a key ingredient in the recipe for startup success, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/are-you-a-startup-or-a-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing is a critical component</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in getting your business off the ground. Securing small business startup funding can be especially challenging and may simply feel out of reach due to the restrictive requirements of traditional business loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let that put a damper on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/create-a-business-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While finding the funds to nurture your startup can be tricky and trying at times, it&#8217;s not a lost cause — in fact, far from it. There are still plenty of great startup business loans and other ’money trees’ for you to explore. To help you better navigate them, we’ve prepared a breakdown of the best funding options for beginners. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free money to start a business? Sounds like a dream come true or, possibly, just too good to be true. Fortunately, business grants are not a myth, and a number of government-backed and private grant options exist for startup businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some potential drawbacks, however. Given their very nature, grants are a competitive option. The application process is sometimes lengthy and labor intensive, and there are rigid rules around how ‌‌funds are used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of grant funding options for you to explore online, including, for example, </span><a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and others such as the Small Business Innovation Research program, or the Small Business Technology Transfer program.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partners with lenders to provide loans to startups and small businesses. Rather than lending directly, the SBA guarantees a percentage of the loan, which helps startup businesses obtain loans with desirable rates and terms that are otherwise extremely rare for a new business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA microloan program partners with nonprofit, community-based lenders to provide startup loans of up to $50,000.</span></p>
<p><b>Non-monetary benefits</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will likely enjoy face-to-face interaction in the form of mentorship, which is a key advantage of SBA microloans. Typically, microloan providers will pair you with other startup founders who can offer advice on a range of topics; for example, finance, business strategy, marketing, and more.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that mentored startups </span><a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/startup-world-mentorship"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise seven times more money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than their independent counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore all SBA loan options and resources </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup business loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A startup business loan is a financing option created to help cover the costs associated with starting a new business. Typically, these funds can be leveraged for supplies, working capital, equipment, real estate, inventory, machinery, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One drawback to consider is that there are usually many hoops to jump through to qualify for loans from traditional lenders. Strict eligibility requirements and rigid terms mean these loans are often outside the realm of possibility for early stage startups. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lines of credit</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business line of credit provides access to revolving capital, similar to a credit card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are often used to cover short-term financial needs, which can include everything from inventory purchases to product development. One key advantage of a business line of credit is that interest is only charged on the amount spent rather than the full credit limit. As with loans, business lines of credit from banks have rigid requirements for startups. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing is generally a more cost-effective option for startups that are seeking out funds with the specific intent of purchasing the physical equipment needed to run their businesses. This type of financing excludes real estate but instead applies to physical assets such as machinery, computers, servers, vehicles, and similar equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the loan is approved, the equipment you purchase then serves as collateral for the lender. This means that the lender can repossess the asset if the loan defaults for non-payment. Equipment financiers generally cover a percentage of the equipment, or even the full cost, and in some cases pay out the loan amount directly to the equipment vendor(s). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If equipment financing sounds like a fit for your business, you may want to check out equipment financing companies such as </span><a href="https://www.elease.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eLease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investor</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An angel investor is typically a high-net-worth individual who funds startups needing access to funding in the early stages of growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest their own money in your business, usually in exchange for a percentage of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/#h-selling-equity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means there’s little risk and no loan to repay if the business fails; instead, if your business succeeds your angel investor takes a share of company profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors are often successful entrepreneurs with extensive startup experience. This added mentorship can be extremely valuable and helpful in shaping the long-term success of a business. However, unless extremely lucky, finding an angel investor isn’t a quick process. It can take multiple time-consuming concept pitches and rejections, and even then, doesn’t always pan out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re considering an angel investor as an avenue for funding, it may be beneficial to brush up your knowledge of the process and learn how to perfect your pitch. Here are some helpful resources to get you started:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thepitch.uk/prepare-pitch-angel-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Prepare a Pitch for Angel Investors</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.harvest.builders/insights/how-to-find-angel-investors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Find and Pitch Angel Investors: The Founder&#8217;s Guide</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture Capitalists (VCs)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike angel investors, who invest their own money, a VC is an outside group that raises capital from limited partners and takes shares of the startup in exchange for funding. Percentages of ownership are negotiable and are usually based on a company&#8217;s valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of a VC are not all financial. Similar to angel investors, VCs can provide an abundance of knowledge, industry connections, and business direction. But the chances of receiving VC funding are quite slim for brand new startups. VCs seek businesses with a rare combination of product and market opportunity that are likely to increase in value rapidly. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/#h-crowdfunding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crowdfunding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of startup funding that doesn’t require a business to fulfill the qualifications that a traditional lender will insist upon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offer equity to attract investors through a crowdfunding platform, so application forms, credit scores, collateral, and similar requirements of traditional lenders are not needed. Crowdfunding is a financing option best suited to startup businesses raising smaller sums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in exploring crowdfunding as a financing option for your startup, there are multiple platforms to consider. Some of the top crowdfunding platforms include </span><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kickstarter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/about/what-we-do#/funding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiegogo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.fundable.com/raise-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast funding for your growing business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an entrepreneur, you’re the only one who knows your goals — and your timetable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re willing to give up equity and have time to invest in the search for grant funding, crowdfunding, or investor pitches, then it could make sense to explore those options further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, if you’re looking to level up your already growing business, you could be better off applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">term loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If approved, you’ll have quick access to the money you need to move forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking fast and flexible financing for your growing business? </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today to see if you qualify for a business line of credit or term loan from Fundbox. </span></p>

Loans enable you to make purchases for your business, hire team members, and cover your everyday expenses as you scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing a loan isn’t always straightforward and the process can be time-consuming, especially if you choose a traditional lender like a bank. In this article, we’ll share some of the processes and requirements for most loan applications so that you can get a better idea of what goes into applying for a business loan before you get started. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your business ready for a loan </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do before you apply for a loan is to determine exactly how you’ll use the funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need financing right away to cover immediate expenses like payroll or rent, you’ll need to look for a loan option that offers a quick approval process and more </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible business credit.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a large sum to invest in your first piece of equipment, you might want to look for loans that use that purchase as collateral if you do not have any other assets yet. Many lenders need you to detail how you’ll use the loan, so this step will help you build your case going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next thing to take a look at is your business’s current financial position. Ensure that your business and personal finances are clearly separated to get a full picture of how the business is doing. Lenders will be looking into your financial history and your past and projected sales as part of the approval process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check both your personal and business </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/credit-score-for-business-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credit scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from reporting agencies like Dun &amp; Bradstreet, TransUnion, and Equifax. Pay down your current debt, including balances on your business and personal credit cards. Using </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-best-percentile-for-credit-utilization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 to 30 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your credit can help boost your credit score. Making sure that you’re in good financial standing with your suppliers and catching up on past-due accounts can also help you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-hacks-building-business-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly boost your credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your creditworthiness affects whether you’ll be approved for the loan, but keep in mind that it also affects the annual percentage rate (APR) you’ll pay on the loan. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/late-payment-credit-score/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better your credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the lower your interest rates will be. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand the application process </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the factors you should look at before applying for a loan is the application process itself. Depending on the lender, you could be spending more time and resources than you bargained for preparing an application and waiting for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional bank loans and loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) typically have the most involved application processes and you might have to wait for a credit decision. Loans from online lenders tend to have applications you can complete in minutes to receive a fast credit decision. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for a bank loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans aren’t always the best option for small businesses, in part because the application process is so rigorous. Banks can offer the best APR to businesses with a credit score of 750 or higher, a strong history of revenue, and several years in operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can still qualify for bank loans with a score between 700-749, but you’ll need to build a good case for your business. Part of the application process is presenting a business plan and detailing how the funds will be used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks also require you to provide information like sales, sales projections, expenses, and cash flow. They need to be sure your cash flow will accommodate regular payments on the loan.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for an SBA-backed loan</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans — including the SBA 7(a) loan, CDC/504 loan, and microloans — are provided through banks and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). The SBA provides some guidelines and requirements for these loans, but lenders also have their own eligibility requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To apply for an SBA loan, you’ll need to have a credit score of at least 680 and provide thorough documentation that includes your business tax returns, profit and loss statement, loan application history, business licenses and registration, and the resumes of your principal leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware that the SBA loan application process can take </span><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/sba-loan-approval-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 30 to 90 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depending on the loan you’re applying for and the lender you choose. SBA Preferred Lenders can process applications faster, but expect to wait a month at minimum for approval. The best way to speed up the approval process is to have all of your documentation in order. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for loan from an online lender</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online lenders and fintech platforms offer term loans as well as lines of credit, merchant cash advances, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and financing. One of the benefits of online platforms is that the application process is significantly quicker and simpler than applying for a loan from a traditional lender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fundbox’s application process requires you to answer a few questions about your business and connect your business checking account and accounting software. A credit decision is made in as little as three minutes, and you can receive funds in your account within three business days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to credit score requirements, most online lenders, including Fundbox, look for scores above 600. Some </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and merchant cash advance providers will not take your credit score into account at all, but you’ll be on the hook for a steeper APR.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the costs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, as you shop around for loan options, keep in mind that taking on debt will cost you. Advertised interest rates likely will not reflect your APR, which includes additional charges like origination fees and ongoing service fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing exactly how you’ll use your loan will come in handy when you’re deciding how much money you’d like. Choosing the loan amount that fits your needs can save you money in the future. Many lenders charge prepayment fees, which means that even if you do not use the full loan amount, you have to continue to repay on a regular basis for the remainder of your repayment term if you want to avoid this penalty.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not a direct cost to you, bear in mind that secured loans require collateral. Equipment loans or mortgages use the property itself as collateral while loans for other purchases are usually secured with a UCC-1 or “blanket” lien, which uses all your business assets as collateral. It can be extremely costly to replace your assets if they are repossessed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some loans, including SBA loans, also require a personal guarantee, which means that personal assets are used as collateral, too. Unsecured loans do not require collateral, but you’ll pay much higher interest rates.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to apply for a business loan?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox offers term loans and lines of credit up to $150,000* for small businesses that need funding quickly. Term loans</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">†</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are paid over 24 or 52 weeks and there are no origination or prepayment penalties. Lines of credit are paid over 12 or 24 weeks and your available credit replenishes as you pay. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify for financing from Fundbox and get extra working capital for everything from your everyday expenses to investing in your most ambitious business goals.  </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Credit line amounts, rates, and terms are based on creditworthiness and subject to change. Additional documentation may be required.</span></i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12-768x476.jpeg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="man packing warehouse" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12-768x476.jpeg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12.jpeg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many business owners, funding is the most challenging part of running a business. Whether your business is well established or at the launch stage, ongoing access to funding is a necessity to create the cash flow and liquidity you need to manage unexpected expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good idea to secure capital from a few different sources to create a funding stream that’s sustainable for the long term. While loans from traditional banking institutions are often among the first that come to mind, they’re far from the only option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a wide world of funding available, including everything from credit cards to angel investors. But these many options can also feel overwhelming, and it’s not always immediately obvious which option is the best fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll provide a rundown of some of the primary options for owners to consider when seeking capital for their new business or enterprise, from the most popular to the unexpected. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-funding, or loans from friends or family </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most obvious source of funding is either a founder’s own savings, or a personal loan from a family member or other close connection. While few have the cash to fund a new business completely, self-funding doesn’t just refer to the cash in an entrepreneur’s personal bank account. It can include other types of assets, such as investments or property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some circumstances, borrowing money from friends and family can be a good option, but this does require caution, as mixing business with personal relationships can be problematic. When borrowing money from a friend or family member, it’s smart to remove as much ambiguity as possible. Mutually agree on terms, then create a written agreement, just as you would with any other loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major advantage of this is that the terms of these loans can be whatever the two parties decide on. For example, the recipient may offer equity in the business in exchange for the funds, or the lender may allow interest-free repayment. The increments in which the loan should be repaid, and the time period to do so, are also up for discussion. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal savings or loans from friends and family are best for businesses that are in the earlier stages of their journey, such as launching or preparing to launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option is also a good fit for businesses with low credit scores, or those that aren’t able to meet the qualifying criteria for a bank loan. In these situations, business owners may see friends and family as their only options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right amount of personal savings and assets to use to fund a business will also depend on the owner’s risk tolerance. How much in the way of liquid assets does the business need to reserve for emergencies and unexpected costs? Calculating </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-does-burn-rate-mean-and-how-is-it-calculated-393196"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burn rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be a good way of determining how much of the owner’s personal savings should be kept easily accessible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There’s no need to go through traditional banks and lenders to access these funds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The repayment terms and schedule are completely up to the recipient and lender.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Self-determined</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of capital comes with much greater freedom than other external funding sources. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mixing business and personal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Borrowing from friends and family has the potential to strain relationships.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Not all businesses have personal cash available, or family and friends who are willing to provide a loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>May drain liquidity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Over-emphasizing cash funding may drain a business’ reserves and leave it vulnerable to unexpected or emergency costs. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Line of credit </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-line-of-credit-for-your-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you access to a revolving credit line, which is money you can use on an ongoing basis. Depending on your credit score and the lender, lines of credit can give you access to funds ranging from a few thousand dollars to several hundred thousand dollars.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a revolving line of credit, the recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed, and they can access the approved funds over and over as long as they continue to pay off their draws. The available credit replenishes as the recipient repays. For example, a business uses its entire $10,000 line of credit to pay for inventory, and repays $2,000 of that borrowed amount. It now will have access to the available credit that’s been repaid, that is $2,000, even with $8,000 outstanding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on lines of credit vary widely depending on the lender; they can range from </span><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/rates-on-a-business-line-of-credit-4153312"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 percent to 25 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the applicant’s credit history. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit is best used for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/ebooks/business-line-credit-work-for-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short-term funding needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regular operational expenses. This might include utilities, restocking supplies, ordering inventory for an expected busy season, or covering unexpected costs </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-disaster-prep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during a crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit can also be an effective way to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridge gaps in cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, a business needs to cover payroll by the end of the week, but payments from clients aren’t expected until the end of the month. This is when a line of credit can be used as a temporary solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Business lines of credit are well suited to a variety of purposes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed‌, saving money if they need less cash than originally anticipated.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher credit limit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even if a business doesn’t need the extra cash, knowing it’s available as a safety net in a pinch can give business owners peace of mind. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Variable interest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some lines of credit come with interest rates that fluctuate with the market. This can make it harder for borrowers to budget their payments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Extra fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the recipient misses a payment, they could end up paying a hefty fee. Plus, many lines of credit come with monthly maintenance or draw fees, which can add up over time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank Loans and Term Loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When many people hear “business funding,” bank loans and traditional term loans are one of the first things that come to mind—simply going to the bank to ask for a loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank approves the loan of a fixed sum of money that the business agrees to repay within a set time frame. These loans can be secured against collateral such as the applicant’s home, investment portfolio, or business assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans and term loans can also be unsecured. Typically, unsecured loans will come at a higher cost, either in the form of a higher interest rate or stricter repayment terms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank and term loans are best for established, highly profitable businesses that can meet the strict loan qualifications and prove their ability to repay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newly launched businesses, those that cannot prove profitability, or those without collateral may not be able to satisfy the often strict terms and need to look elsewhere for funding.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Affordable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bank and term loans typically offer lower interest rates than other sources of funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Recipients usually have more time to repay these loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Widely accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are many options available for this kind of funding, through most banks and traditional financial institutions—the hurdle is actually getting approved. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sustainable repayment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Term loans allow you to repay the debt in a steady, predictable way over a moderately long period of time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Strict requirements and a high volume of applicants can make it difficult to qualify for bank and term loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dependent on financial standing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A business needs to have available collateral and be able to prove its profitability before it can be considered for a loan. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed by the SBA, these desirable, but competitive, U.S. government loans are designed specifically for the needs of small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loan programs are drafted in agreement between lenders and the SBA, as the SBA shoulders some of the risks for the lender by guaranteeing a portion of the loan amount. This arrangement benefits both lenders and small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower risk for lenders means they can offer more flexible payment terms and lower interest rates than most small businesses would otherwise be able to secure.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans are highly desirable, which means there is a lot of competition for them and that makes them hard to qualify for. This kind of funding is best for businesses with a good credit history, a clear business plan, and the ability to make a strong case for their profitability.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Designed especially for small businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unlike traditional bank loans, SBA loans target small businesses. The SBA, in partnership with lenders, created guidelines with the aim of aiding small business expansion and growth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Multiple uses for the funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans can be used for a wide range of expenses. According to the SBA, you can use these loans for “most” business purposes, including start-up, expansion, equipment purchases, working capital, inventory, or real estate purchases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Secured loans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans are secured, meaning that the SBA reduces the lender’s risk by guaranteeing a percentage of the loan amount. However, if the business is unable to pay what it owes, the bank can still seize its assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to more lenders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because the federal government guarantees SBA loans, more lenders are willing to offer financing to small businesses through this channel. Many lenders even lower their qualification criteria for small businesses that apply for SBA loans.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Personal credit scores required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In order to qualify for an SBA loan, applicants must have a high personal credit score as well as good business credit. If either score is low, they may not be eligible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that this is also a requirement for the other types of business funding listed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Over two years in business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses must be at least two years old to qualify for an SBA loan. That can be a problem for the over 400,000 new businesses that start up every year in the U.S. and need operational capital to run.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Some restrictions on expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some SBA loan programs have restrictions regarding ‌capital, meaning the money the SBA provides can only be used for specific purposes. The way a business plans to use the funds may have an impact on its loan terms, so applicants should consider their expenses carefully when selecting the appropriate program and before applying for the loan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Specific eligibility requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even though it’s generally easier to get approved for SBA loans than for traditional bank loans, the eligibility criteria can still prove tough for many small businesses. The SBA determines eligibility based on factors such as the nature of the business, where the business operates, and the character of its principals. You can find more details about eligibility requirements for SBA loans on the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official government website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity Investors</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors and venture capital (VC) firms are the two major sources of this type of funding. Angel investors are individuals who invest in companies they believe in, in exchange for equity in and partial ownership of the business. VC firms are larger companies instead of individuals, but like angel investors, they make their money by investing in promising companies for a stake in the business. They both provide valuable expertise, connections, and a wealth of experience to the business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity-based funding sources are best for startups and companies with very high growth potential. They aren’t a typical funding route for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, venture capitalists and angel investors will sometimes invest in businesses with disruptive, unproven business models that may be seen as too high-risk for traditional banks. Businesses that fit those parameters should definitely consider equity investors as part of their funding strategy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Support and mentorship</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When businesses choose equity investors, they get leadership and guidance along with business funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher funding ceiling</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These options come with the potential to secure more funding, ranging from </span><a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-funding-guide/equity-based-financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25,000 – $150,000 for angel investors to much larger amounts for VC firms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Equity investors expect serious returns, so they’re only suitable for businesses planning on dramatic growth trajectories and gaining a very large market share.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sharing control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While the experience and connections may be well worth it, sharing equity does mean giving up some degree of control over the business and how it is run. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Lenders </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses seeking funding aren’t limited to bank, family, or government-backed loans. Online lenders, including peer-to-peer lending platforms, balance sheet lenders, and lender marketplaces, have emerged as a solution to make business funding more easily and widely accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech companies like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are leveraging algorithms, predictive modeling, data aggregation, and electronic payment technology to streamline ‌loan applications and increase the efficiency of the approval process to make funding more accessible for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Fundbox, a business owner can secure flexible funding with a line of credit without needing to collect extensive documentation or undergo a rigorous approval process. This way, a business can access funds at a moment’s notice and take advantage of growth opportunities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders are an excellent option for viable, established businesses that may not yet be able to qualify for a bank loan. They are also a great fit for businesses with a slightly lower credit rating. While credit history is a consideration, online lenders won’t place the same level of emphasis on it that a traditional financial institution would. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ease of access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Online lenders use an application process that is faster, easier, and more streamlined, which is especially good for urgent or unexpected expenses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Less competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of funding can be easier to access than an SBA or bank loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lower barrier to entry</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Collateral is typically not required to be approved for funding from online lenders. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses will still need to be at least somewhat established to qualify. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Must have credit history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The applicant’s business and personal credit history is still a consideration. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wide World of Business Funding</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking business funding can feel overwhelming, but there are enough options out there that whatever your business&#8217; unique structure, needs, and goals, you will be able to find the right funding fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owners now have greater options beyond the obvious choices of bank loans, lines of credit, and credit cards, and can take advantage of multiple funding sources to create a multi-stream, sustainable business funding strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox is trusted by hundreds of thousands of small businesses. We’re committed to connecting small businesses to the working capital they need to grow and thrive.</span></p>

However, getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) can help you overcome some of these challenges by giving you access to programs that provide professional connections and resources that can help strengthen your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a certified MBE, you’ll have more opportunities to bid for both corporate and federal business contracts. You can also be eligible for funding, such as grants, and participate in business development training. In this article, we’ll look at the different avenues for certification and how they can benefit your business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Minority Business Enterprise?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Minority Business Enterprise is most commonly defined as a company that is at least 51 percent owned and operated by an individual who is a U.S. citizen and is at least 25 percent African American, Asian American, Pacific Islander, Latinx or Hispanic, or Native American descent. If the company is publicly traded, there can be requirements that enforce shareholder and employee diversity, as well. Oftentimes, a publicly traded company must be at least 51 percent minority-owned, and the core management and operations of the company must be controlled by team members who are part of these minority groups. The business must also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be a for-profit enterprise and physically located in the U.S. or its trust territories.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting an MBE certification can support your business strategy by opening up additional opportunities for you to secure funding and drive revenue.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of the major advantages to getting your business certified as an MBE:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Network expansion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with other MBEs for potential joint-venture and partnership opportunities. Take advantage of programs that get your business in front of potential customers and procurement professionals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Education and business advisory: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get access to professional development programs and support to expand your business skill set, including resources like technical training, mentorship, and marketing assistance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Federal contracts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many federal agencies are required to give a certain number of contracts to certified minority-owned businesses. Certification means you can compete for these contracts and connect with advisors who can help you navigate the process. This can open up your business to new opportunities and important relationships you might not have found otherwise. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to funding: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are programs available across the country to help minority-owned businesses receive access to capital they might not otherwise be able to generate from their own networks. These programs provide grants and loans that can help you reach your business goals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Incentivizes investment and partnership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Both state and federal tax benefits are available to other businesses that engage with MBE-certified organizations. There are also tax benefits for working with organizations that employ minorities. However, there are </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/finance/minority-owned-businesses-taxes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no tax benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically for certified MBEs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get certified as a Minority Business Enterprise </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple ways to get an MBE certification. The most common programs include: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Small Business Administration (SBA) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local programs </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s some overlap between each of these options, but it’s a good idea to understand the differences to get the most benefit for your business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through the National Minority Supplier Development Council</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) is considered the gold standard for ensuring supplier diversity in the private sector. This certification program is great for businesses that want to connect with private corporations to do contract work with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the MBE certification, the NMSDC offers opportunities for you to access financial and educational resources and expand your professional networks. </span></p>
<p><b>Key benefits of certification with the NMSDC</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business listing in the regional and national minority supplier database. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking opportunities with over 12,000 fellow MBEs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities to reach and win contracts with over 1,400 large corporate members, including companies like Accenture, Apple, Bank of America, Delta Airlines, Google, UnitedHealth Group, Walmart, and Walt Disney Company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to funding opportunities through their Business Consortium Fund, the Growth Initiative Program, and the Capital Manager’s Program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing access to technical and leadership training.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How to apply for an MBE certification through the NMSDC</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being at least 51 percent owned by minority individuals, the NMSDC requires that your business is a for-profit enterprise, and the management and daily operations must be done by minority ownership members. </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/what-is-an-mbe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a full overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their criteria for identifying minority-owned businesses to see if you qualify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NMSDC has an online application process through </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but before you get started, you’ll need to get in touch with the </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/our-network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional affiliate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s closest to your business’ headquarters. They will guide you through the application process and ensure you’re compliant with the standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire certification process can take up to 90 days to complete, and you’ll have to wait for final approval from both the board and committee members. If your application is approved, they’ll notify you by email and postal mail. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Application Fees for NMSDC Certification:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on your regional affiliate, </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/inc-magazine-get-certified-minority-owned-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be between $350 and $1,200. Affiliates will classify your business based on your annual revenue and your fee will reflect your classification. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.scmsdc.org/certification"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern California Minority Supplier Development Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charges $400 for businesses that make less than $1 million in annual revenue and have the option to pay extra for an expedited application process.  </span></td>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through the Small Business Administration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to succeed in the public sector—winning contracts with federal, state, and local government bodies—you could benefit from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government has a goal to spend at least 5 percent of its contracting dollars on businesses with the 8(a) designation. To take part in the 8(a) program, your business has to be at least 51 percent directly owned and controlled by U.S. citizens who qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged in the </span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR4ef1291a4a984ab/section-124.103"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Federal Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><b>How to apply for the SBA 8(a) program </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can apply for the SBA 8(a) program online through </span><a href="https://certify.sba.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certify.SBA.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, unlike the NMSDC’s regional affiliate structure, the SBA doesn’t offer application support. Keep in mind that it may take a significant amount of time and resources to put together an application yourself. There are several consulting firms available to hire to help you organize your documents and ensure that your application has a good chance of being approved. Before you dive in, the SBA also provides a </span><a href="https://certify.sba.gov/am-i-eligible"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary assessment tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can use to quickly see if the program is right for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full outline of the steps you need to take to apply can be found on the </span><a href="https://sbaone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CHDB/pages/1294172161/Prepare+and+Submit+Your+8+a+Initial+Application"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certify knowledge base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Here are some of the major requirements you need to meet to be eligible for the 8(a) Business Development Program:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to qualify under the SBA </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/size-standards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you apply and throughout the nine-year program. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business cannot have previously participated in the 8(a) program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have the financial capacity to perform ‌federal contracts successfully.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot owe any outstanding federal financial obligations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business is owned by someone with a personal net worth of $250,000 or less.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner has an average adjusted gross income of $250,000 or less for three years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner has $4 million or less in assets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business is accepted into the program, you’ll receive a mailed letter within 90 days from the SBA informing you that your application was approved. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Application Fees for the</b> <b>SBA 8(a) Program:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Application to the 8(a) program is free. Keep in mind that the time you spend applying is also a cost to your business. If you choose to hire a consulting firm to help you out with the application process, the cost for these services will vary by provider. </span></td>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through state and local programs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to NMSDC and SBA certifications, there are also several MBE certification programs that are intended to help connect companies with state and local government contracts that are set aside for minority-owned businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of state-level certification programs include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.mbocolorado.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado: Minority Business Office</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DAS/Procurement/Supplier-Diversity/SBE-MBE-Program-Certification-Application-Small-or-Minority-Business-Enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecticut: Supplier Diversity Program</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://gmsdc.org/get-certified/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia: Minority Business Enterprise Certification</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://hidot.hawaii.gov/administration/ocr/dbe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii: Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.development.ohio.gov/bs/bs_mbac_cert.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio: Minority &amp; Small Business Certification</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3209"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York: NYS Minority and Women Business Development (MWBE) Program</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find out if your state offers similar programs via </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/minority-business-development.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this directory.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for local certification programs on your municipality’s website. Typically, these resources are found in the economic development section or certification section and list programs available for local minority-owned businesses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do women-owned businesses qualify as MBEs? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the NMSDC doesn’t have certifications specifically for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women-owned businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.wbenc.org/certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s Business Enterprise National Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (WBENC) is a non-profit organization that provides the most widely recognized certification for women-owned businesses in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of being certified are similar to the NMSDC program, including access to a network of other private-sector companies and the potential to reach procurement executives at major organizations. Educational support and marketing assistance are also available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of the SBA 8(a) program, women-owned businesses still need to qualify as being economically disadvantaged under their criteria. You can take a look at the examples in this section of the </span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR4ef1291a4a984ab/section-124.103"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Federal Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that the SBA offers a </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/women-owned-small-business-federal-contracting-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, this program is similar to the SBA 8(a) program in terms of requirements and benefits. If you are both a woman and qualify as an economically disadvantaged individual, you can be certified as an Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final thoughts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, minority business owners have faced challenges in accessing </span><a href="https://www.biz2credit.com/research-reports/minority-owned-businesses-express-optimism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and winning large contracts. During the pandemic, the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program also presented issues with equitable distribution of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-business-ppp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP funds to minority small businesses.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a certified MBE, you’ll have access to favorable contract opportunities, marketing assistance, and other valuable resources like business training and mentorship. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="black businesswoman at wallboard planning marketing strategy" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1972740689.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot to think about when starting a business, and expenses are one of them. The costs you incur now can help you determine if you need to secure funding, at what point you’ll break even, and where you can realize savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the average cost of starting a business can run into tens of thousands of dollars, many small and microbusinesses – particularly home-based companies – can get started for much less.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of 25+ small business expenses (grouped by category), plus tips for tracking, managing, and reducing your costs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Fixed business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed business expenses are precisely that; they remain the same from month to month. These include the overhead of running a business, such as commercial lease payments, mortgage, property taxes, self-employment tax, salaries, loan payments, and business insurance. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculating your average fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you understand how much it costs to operate your business and areas where you can save. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed expenses may be tax deductible. For example, you can generally deduct employee pay, insurance, taxes, interest payments, and rent expenses. In addition, if you have a home office that is used regularly and exclusively for business purposes (the dining room table doesn’t count), you can also deduct the fixed expenses associated by claiming the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/home-office-deduction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home office deduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be sure to consult IRS guidance on </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deducting Business Expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or speak to a business tax advisor.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Variable business expenses</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has expenses that vary from month to month or activity to activity. Variable costs include marketing and advertising, inventory, labor, sales commissions, business mileage, meals and entertainment, gifts, raw materials, maintenance costs, utilities, seasonal hiring, and utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a restaurant, retail business, or niche business, your variable expenses may typically run higher.</span></p>
<h3><b>Overlooked business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always look for tax deductions. You might be surprised at which business expenses the IRS allows business owners to write off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often overlooked expenses include fixed costs like health insurance premiums. If you pay for healthcare insurance entirely out of your pocket using after-tax dollars (no government subsidies or employer share) you should plan for these and may be able to claim a tax deduction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other costs that often fly under the radar and are tax deductible include mileage incurred driving to meetings or even to the store to buy office supplies (check the IRS website for the latest standard mileage rate, which changes each year). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Variable startup costs like business incorporation fees and the services of a registered agent also play into your budget and are deductible expenses. In addition, if you work with a third-party to help you with legal or accounting matters, you may also write off these expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your cell phone bill a startup expense? Yes, if you use it primarily and exclusively for business. However, if you use your cellphone for personal and business use, the IRS requires you to divide the cost and only claim the business use as a tax deduction.  </span></p>
<h3><b>How to calculate startup costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know the business expenses involved in starting a business. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers many </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/calculate-your-startup-costs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resources and tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can help with these tasks. These include a </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/breakevenpointcalculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profit analysis calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (to calculate your breakeven point), </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/Startup%20Costs%20Worksheet-508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business startup costs calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free business counseling.</span></a></p>
<h3><b>How to track business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking and managing your expenses will help you stay on top of your financial health and prepare for tax season. The first step to doing this is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/dont-mix-business-personal-finances/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate your personal and business finances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Having a designated business bank account and credit card makes it much easier to record and track your expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking expenses by spreadsheet is ok, but this method can be hard to scale and maintain accuracy. On the other hand, investing in accounting software and the services of an accountant can help ensure accurate tracking, proper categorization for tax purposes, and report generation. Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/track-business-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to track your small business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has also made it easier to stay on top of the receipts and invoices generated by startup costs. Mobile apps like </span><a href="https://use.expensify.com/expense-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expensify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.concur.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/mobile-apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FreshBooks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accounting/track-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuickBooks Expense Tracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> let you scan your paperwork on the go, import credit card data, import your expenses into your accounting system, and more. </span></p>
<h3><b>How to cut business expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a clear picture of your business expenses, find places to cut costs and maximize your profit margin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your quarterly business expense report to identify which expenses are critical and which are not necessary or negotiable. For instance, you may be able to reduce inventory costs by setting up automatic re-orders when inventory gets instead of keeping excess inventory in stock. Also, talk to your cellphone carrier to see if they can offer a cheaper plan based on usage and your number of employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the biggest expenses for a small business? In most cases, these will be labor, benefits, and taxes. Addressing these costs requires a more aggressive approach. But before you reduce headcount, talk to your tax advisor to find out if you’re overpaying on taxes. You could also consult an employee benefits broker to help develop a custom benefits plan that meets your workforce’s needs while staying within your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue to make cuts until you’ve reached your target budget. Here are some </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-cut-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top ways to cut small business expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Many entrepreneurs start by thinking about different entities, like a sole proprietor or limited liability company, they may choose to incorporate as that suits their needs. In addition, some may question when it is the best time to incorporate or if it is necessary to incorporate a business at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may seem like a lot of information to consider, the process of incorporation is actually much less overwhelming than it appears for entrepreneurs. Here is a breakdown of the basics you need to understand before incorporating a business.</span></p>
<h2>Choosing an Entity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entity formation you choose to incorporate your business will depend on a few factors. You will need to consider the type of business you are starting and plans to grow and expand the company over time. Some of the most popular entities include these three structures:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sole Proprietorship.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Almost every small business starts as a sole proprietorship, which is often referred to as a default entity. A sole proprietorship allows the owner of the company to exercise complete control over the business. This may be an ideal option for an entrepreneur that wishes to be the boss, as a sole proprietorship is responsible for everything that impacts the business. However, a sole proprietorship does not have limited liability. Without this added benefit, the business owner may be held liable for both good and bad things that impact the company. A sole proprietorship is also not privy to receiving as many tax benefits due to the unincorporated nature of the business. This means a sole proprietor is fully responsible for paying self-employment taxes to cover their Social Security and Medicare obligations. At times, this may amount to thousands of dollars — and can feel like a bit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much tax responsibility. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Limited Liability Company (LLC).</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An LLC is a popular entity formation to incorporate your business. LLCs have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible management structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing more than one owner (member) to run the company. Limited liability protection is one of an LLC’s primary benefits. This creates a separation between the assets of the owner and the business. The separation ensures that the owner’s belongings, like houses and cars, are not used for collateral in the event of an unforeseen circumstance, like a lawsuit. An LLC may also choose the manner in which the entity would like to be taxed. LLCs, which are pass-through entities, are treated and taxed as partnerships on the federal level. They may elect to be taxed as another pass-through entity, such as an S Corporation. The result of that election means a limited liability company is able to avoid significant self-employment taxes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Corporation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This entity may be ideal for incorporating a business that has plans to create a global presence or offer an IPO. A corporation is a highly structured entity formation. Incorporating as a corporation means the business needs to elect a board of directors and corporate officers, take </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/11/corporate-minutes-bylaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during meetings, and establish bylaws. Corporations may also issue shares of stock and sell percentages of the business to its owners (shareholders). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are even more entity options available to incorporate your business. Some of these include partnerships, C Corporations, and S Corporations. If you are unsure as to which entity is the right fit for your business, meet with a legal or tax professional. Ask any questions you may have about the incorporation process, so you have peace of mind in moving ahead to incorporate your business. </span></p>
<h2>Best Time to Incorporate a Business</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a specific time of the year where it’s ideal to incorporate a business? Here’s an inside tip. There is no “best” or “worst” time of the year to start a business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may find, depending on your offerings and services, your company does well seasonally or has specific quarters where sales are strong. Consider such seasonal factors when deciding when you should start and incorporate a business. Planning a launch to happen prior to a peak in holiday tourism is one common strategy, whereas others prefer to launch at the start of the calendar year. “Start a business” may be a popular New Year’s resolution, which is why many entrepreneurs use the last few months of the year to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/writing-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">draft business plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and prepare for a January launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event that you decide to start a business towards the end of the year, you may find it’s advantageous to consider a delayed filing rather than file a standard incorporation filing. This allows you to file your paperwork for the delayed filing and set an effective date of incorporation. This date is usually scheduled for about 30 to 90 days out into the future. Once the effective date arrives, the business’ incorporation paperwork will have been completed and the company will officially be in existence. This gives you the chance to start the year with a brand-new business. As a bonus, setting the effective date for the new year means that your business is not obligated to file or pay taxes or conduct annual maintenance for the previous year because you were not officially in existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, keep in mind that not every state allows delayed filing requests. You may need to check in with the local Secretary of State to determine if your state of incorporation offers delayed filings and how you can reserve a date.</span></p>
<h2>Why Should You Incorporate a Business?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it a good idea to incorporate your business? Technically, a small business may remain in its default entity as a sole proprietorship. It is still possible for a business to operate as an unincorporated entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unincorporated businesses may not realize that incorporation has many long-term benefits. When you incorporate your business, you receive limited liability protection. Tax responsibilities are lessened when electing a pass-through entity. It is easier to build business credit and to establish credibility with consumers. The credibility your business has, from industries ranging to medical to retail, allows the company to develop a strong brand reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned earlier, any entrepreneur that feels unsure about incorporating their business may wish to speak with a tax or legal professional. They may answer questions you have about the best entity for your offerings, states you may consider incorporating in, and how to elect a pass-through entity for tax purposes. Perhaps You’ll leave feeling more confident and secure once learning about the incorporation process.</span></p>

The IRS has extended the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-extends-additional-tax-deadlines-for-individuals-to-may-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal income tax filing deadline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from April 15, 2021 to May 17, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This filing extension gives taxpayers a bit of extra time to file their taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal income tax extension aside, all other deadlines for filing small business taxes appear to be on schedule for this year. Of course, the kinds of taxes small business owners pay will vary depending on its entity formation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s examine what small business taxes may look like for a limited liability company (LLC). What kinds of taxes can an LLC expect to pay and what are some upcoming deadlines to be mindful of in Q2 and beyond?</span></p>
<h2>LLCs and “pass-through” tax treatment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several benefits that come with forming an LLC. An LLC provides its owners with limited liability. This separates and protects personal assets belonging to the business owner in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. In addition, you may be able to build credibility with customers faster as an incorporated business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLCs are what is referred to as a “pass-through” entity. This means that the profits of the business pass through to the owners (</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also known as members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). An LLC’s members report profits and losses on their individual tax returns, and not at the business level. The flexibility of a pass-through entity ensures that the LLC is able to legally avoid double taxation. An LLC is taxed only once at the individual level, not twice as it might be under a different entity like a C Corporation.</span></p>
<h2>LLCs and entity classification election</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that while an LLC is a pass-through entity, it may be </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">treated as a partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the IRS. This is the entity’s default federal tax classification. A single member LLC, for example, may also be treated by the IRS as a sole proprietorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this does not mean an LLC may be taxed as a partnership or sole proprietorship. The entity must specify how it would like to be classified for federal income tax purposes. In order to make this specification, an LLC must file </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 8832</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This allows the LLC to elect to be classified as an association taxable as a specific entity, like an S Corporation.</span></p>
<h2>S Corporation tax election</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, many small business owners will choose to have their LLC taxed as an S Corporation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why elect this status and what kind of impact does an S Corp have on small business taxes? An S Corporation is also a </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/10/forming-s-corporation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pass-through entity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Income passes through to the individual level to avoid double taxation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, LLCs face eligibility requirements before it can set up as an S Corporation. The business must be able to meet certain ownership and stock criteria. Some examples include that the business may not have more than 100 shareholders, that the shareholders are all individual personas, and the business only has a single class of stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have an understanding of an LLC as a pass-through entity, how to elect a different tax classification, and why S Corporations are the preferred tax election. Let’s review some of the taxes an LLC needs to file and the suggested forms necessary for these filings.</span></p>
<h2>Small business taxes for Q2 (and beyond)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small businesses, tax season is not limited to one day each year. Do not focus solely on federal and state income </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consider these additional small business taxes and payments in Q2 and beyond.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Income taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remember that what an LLC pays is ultimately determined by the way it elects to be taxed with the IRS. Otherwise, an LLC pays income taxes through its default federal tax classification.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Estimated taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is for sole proprietors, S Corporation shareholders, and self-employed individuals that owe $1,000 or more in taxes. These taxes are paid through estimated tax payments. Typically, these payments are made four times throughout the year. The deadlines for the remaining 2021 quarters are April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 18, 2022. Use </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 1040-ES</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine your estimated tax payments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Self-employment taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This tax is paid by self-employed workers. It acts as a social security and Medicare tax. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employment taxes.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Businesses that have employees will withhold payroll taxes in order to fund social security and Medicare. Employers also withhold FICA tax, federal income, and federal unemployment (FUTA) tax from employee wages. FICA taxes may be reported using </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form 941</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Do you have more tax questions?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think you might be missing out on any small business tax credits or deductions? Did your small business utilize COVID-19 resources and you have questions as to how this may impact filing small business taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I personally cannot provide tax advice, I do recommend getting the proper tax help. Reach out to a trusted tax professional. Seek out the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right tax professional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business, which may range from a CPA, bookkeeper, or accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the topics you address may include the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask questions about tax credits and deductions you may be entitled to for a potential tax refund. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review tools that can help you better stay organized with your tax documents and deadlines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look into which business records you should keep and why it’s good to hold on to these documents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk about your LLC. If you’re unsure of whether you should elect an S Corp filing or have any other questions that pertain to the business, a tax professional will be able to guide you.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also work with a tax professional to plan ahead for upcoming quarters in business. Look into upcoming deadlines for additional tax payments. Let your tax professional provide assistance year-round for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sooner you are able to meet with a professional ahead of the May 17, 2021 deadline, the more you’ll have the peace of mind in knowing you were able to file your taxes correctly and will be able to tackle upcoming tax deadlines with confidence and careful organization.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Young woman entrepreneur working from home" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_469372505.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking an entity formation for your startup isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation. A startup’s entity formation depends on the needs of the business. Generally speaking, however, there are three entity formation types that most entrepreneurs choose to incorporate their organization.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sole Proprietorship</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited Liability Company (LLC)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporation </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some businesses may decide they would like to form a limited liability company, or LLC, because of the entity’s flexibility. Others may choose to incorporate as a corporation, especially if they plan to expand the business and open up global locations. And some entrepreneurs may stick with the default entity formation of a sole proprietorship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, we will look at three entity formation types that are popular for incorporating a business, the benefits of each legal entity, and how to start the registration process. </span></p>
<h2>What does it meant to incorporate?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often use the word “incorporate” when discussing small business. However, not everyone knows the definition of this word. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporation is the process of creating a corporate business structure. That structure allows the business to act as a separate, legal entity from its owner. The owner also receives limited liability protection because it has incorporated. Liability protection creates a separation between the assets belonging to the owner and those belonging to the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you need limited liability when running a business? Let’s say your business experiences an unforeseen circumstance, like accumulating too much business debt it is unable to pay off in a timely manner. If you had not incorporated, your personal assets may be at risk of seizure. Your house or car could be used as collateral to repay the debt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, incorporation separates the assets of the business and owner. The owner’s personal belongings would not be impacted because the business incorporated as a business entity. </span></p>
<h2>Sole Proprietorship</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sole proprietorship is often known as a default entity formation. Essentially, that means many businesses begin as a sole proprietor for a few reasons. It’s an affordable entity formation with the least amount of paperwork involved in the filing process. However, one of the primary draws for being a sole proprietor is that this entity formation allows entrepreneurs to be the boss. They get to be in charge of everything and call the shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds pretty good, right? There is one catch. Sole proprietors are responsible for good things impacting the business—and bad things, too. What if a customer is injured on their property or valuable information is lost during a security breach? A sole proprietor would need to be prepared to take full responsibility for these incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes this can prove to be too much responsibility in a sole proprietorship. If this is the case, they may choose to incorporate as an entity formation where there is limited liability to protect their assets. Many sole proprietors will </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2020/08/sole-proprietors-form-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gives them access to limited liability. It allows the business owner to keep running the company with extra peace of mind that their business has extra protection. </span></p>
<h2>LLC</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LLC is a popular entity formation for several reasons. Forming an LLC means businesses have the ability to access limited liability protection for personal and professional assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner of the LLC, also known as a member, may also choose a flexible </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the LLC. Three options are available, including single member LLC, member managed LLC, and manager managed LLC. In a single member LLC, for example, the sole owner manages the LLC. Whereas a member managed LLC would be managed by multiple members of the LLC and a manager managed LLC would allow the LLC to appoint a board of managers to run the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major appeal in forming an LLC is choosing how you would like the entity taxed. LLCs are taxed as a pass-through entity by default. This means profits “pass-through” to members and are reported on individual tax returns instead of at the business level. Members of the LLC may also deduct losses on their personal tax returns to further offset income and ease tax filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLCs, which are treated and taxed as a partnership on the federal level, often elect to be taxed as a different entity. For example, let’s say an LLC elects to be taxed as an S Corporation. This type of corporation has a pass-through entity status, which allows LLCs to be taxed as a pass-through entity. This helps avoid significant self-employment taxes for the LLC. Incidentally, sole proprietors are also responsible for paying self-employment taxes—which is another good reason to consider incorporating as an LLC!</span></p>
<h2>Corporation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the three entity formations, a corporation is the most structured entity. It shares certain similarities with LLCs, including limited liability and the ability to elect as an S Corp for tax purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a corporation is not nearly as flexible as an LLC. Corporations require formal structures to run their business. This includes electing a board of directors and corporate officers. Corporate minutes must be taken during meetings and bylaws must be established as the corporation’s </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2019/11/corporate-minutes-bylaws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules and regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A corporation may issue shares of stock and sell percentages of the business to its owners, which are also known as shareholders. Ideally, this is the kind of entity that may be the best fit for a business with plans to go public, offer an IPO, and launch a worldwide presence. </span></p>
<h2>Which entity formation should I incorporate as?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three entity formation types are only a handful of business entities available to incorporate as. Entrepreneurs may also explore Certified B Corporations, partnerships, and C Corporations. Much of the decision depends on the business and its needs. If you have any questions about which entity to incorporate as, consult a legal professional for additional advice.</span></p>
