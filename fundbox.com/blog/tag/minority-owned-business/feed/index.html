To support this growth, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) created the </span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/get-certified"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This program helps LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and business owners to compete in the mainstream marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certification can offer a number of benefits, including helping you connect with other businesses and organizations that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed to diversity and inclusion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also highlights your commitment to equality and helps promote your business as a leader in the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll walk you through the process of getting certified as an LGBTQIA+ owned business and how it can benefit your business moving forward.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is granted by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. The NGLCC is the exclusive, third-party certification body that verifies that eligible businesses are majority-owned by LGBTQIA+ individuals. It also subsequently grants the Certified LGBT Business Enterprise® (Certified LGBTBE®) designation to such businesses as part of its</span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/SDI-FAQ#1a"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBT Supplier Diversity Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This certification gives LGBTQIA+ business owners access to a number of benefits, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A powerful business network of over 200 corporate partners. Each partner is committed to supplier diversity and the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ owned businesses in their supply chains.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased visibility for your business through NGLCC’s extensive online database of Certified LGBTBE® companies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to NGLCC’s national, international, and local events throughout the year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who qualifies for LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for NGLCC certification, your business must be majority-owned by an LGBTQIA+ person or persons. In addition, at least 51 percent of the management and daily operations of the company must be controlled by LGBTQIA+ individuals. The application process includes providing documentation to prove both ownership and citizenship.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LGBTQIA+ community is a thriving economic driver. In fact, data shows that there is over</span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/334983"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.7 trillion dollars in purchasing power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the LGBTQIA+ community. In addition, research from the NGLCC found that LGBTQIA+ buyers are 75 percent more likely to change brands if they know they are inclusive of the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does LGBTBE® certification connect you with like-minded business owners and corporate allies, but it also allows your company to tap into a whole host of exclusive opportunities. Some of these include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to exclusive networking and business development opportunities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free or discounted rates for NGLCC events and webinars.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentorship and educational programs through the NGLCC network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounts on products and services from NGLCC partners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarship opportunities through Tuck&#8217;s School of Business Executive Education Program at Dartmouth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) to consumers, employees, and partners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, diversity and inclusion has become a top priority for many American businesses. Gaining LGBTBE® certification can help you stand out when competing for business opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also serve as a role model for up-and-coming LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and help pave the way for a more inclusive economy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for LGBTBE® certification are available online through the NGLCC. There is a four-step application process for businesses that wish to become certified. Application fees are typically waived for any business that is already a member of a local NGLCC-affiliated Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how to get started.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Fill out the online application</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, create a business profile on</span><a href="http://my.nglcc.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my.nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this stage, you need to provide documentation to prove that you meet the requirements for certification. The required paperwork must attest that each majority company owner is LGBTQIA+ and that they have control, manage, operate, and possess at least 51 percent of the firm. You can learn more about the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/steps-lgbtbe-certification"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">specific documentation required for NGLCC certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note there is a $400 fee (current to the time of this post’s publication) to submit your application.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Schedule an on-site visit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Certified LGBTBE® companies must provide site visits to the NGLCC&#8217;s regional certification committees. These visits serve two purposes: First, they provide an opportunity for the committee to become familiar with the business and its day-to-day operations. Second, these visits give committee members a chance to get to know you and your business goals better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site visits are generally 30 minutes long and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Your application will be reviewed</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your visit, the National Certification Committee will determine your certification status. This process can take up to 90 days.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Get approved and onboarded</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your application is approved, you&#8217;ll be invited to participate in an orientation webinar. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the benefits of certification and how to make the most of them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification for people of color</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intersectionality is a key value at NGLCC, which is why they&#8217;ve committed to promoting LGBTBE® certification for people of color through the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/coci"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities of Color Initiative (CoCI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a person of color and are interested in getting certified, reach out to </span><a href="mailto:coci@nglcc.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coci@nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTQIA+ businesses who are also </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/loans-minority-owned-businesses-10-options-consider/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be eligible for Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certification, which can offer additional opportunities for government contracts and set-asides (contracts that the government has set aside for businesses that comply with certain requirements). Learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-certified-minority-business-enterprise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBE certification here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrate your pride with LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a Certified LGBTBE® company can help your business connect with a wider community of LGBTQIA+ supporters, as well as government institutions and funding options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, by increasing your business&#8217;s visibility as an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone, you&#8217;re not only supporting the LGBTQIA+ community, but also helping to create a more diverse and prosperous future for us all.</span></p>

In honor of Women’s History Month, we’re highlighting helpful lessons and tips from successful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executives, and entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Identify your purpose</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re running a business, you need to identify your “big why,” said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.christinasjahli.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Sjahli Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that offers virtual CFO services to mission-driven women entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding your clear sense of purpose enables you to focus on what matters most to you and push forward in the challenging moments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already identified your purpose, take some time to reflect. Do you want to build a product that makes people’s lives easier? Do you want to create jobs in your community? Maybe you want to offer a service that helps people achieve a specific goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you figure out what’s fueling you, not only are you less likely to suffer from imposter syndrome, Sjahli said, you’re also able to set better boundaries and goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to find your purpose:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about why you wanted to start a business. What gets you excited? Who is your business for? What are you trying to achieve? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrow your focus and define your mission.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Embrace the opportunity to grow </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned to always take on things I’d never done before. Growth and comfort do not coexist.” – Virginia (Ginni) Rometty, former CEO of IBM</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not be afraid to make decisions. Do not be afraid to make mistakes.” – Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a thriving business, you have to be willing to take risks and embrace challenges. Getting outside your comfort zone can help you gain new skills, solve problems more effectively, and achieve your goals faster. Depending on your business and background, a growth opportunity could be buying the building next door or figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitize your services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to embrace growth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say yes to challenging projects and endeavors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be willing to try new things, whether that means developing a new product or targeting a different customer demographic. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out time and resources for one or two company growth projects a year, like launching a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening a second store. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Be tenacious</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are committed to creating value and if you aren’t afraid of hard times, obstacles become utterly unimportant. A nuisance perhaps, but with no real power. The world respects creation; people will get out of your way.” – Candice Carpenter Olson, former Co-CEO of Fullbridge</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, dealing with setbacks and hardships is inevitable. In order to overcome the obstacles you encounter—including the challenges unique to women, like gender biases and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/score-report-the-financial-state-of-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay inequity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—tenacity is critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe women entrepreneurs must stay resilient and go into each room with confidence like they belong,” said Chynna Morgan, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="http://gifsoutloud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifs Out Loud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that creates experiential marketing campaigns. Picking yourself up takes practice, but it’s the only way to make progress toward your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned early that rejection is protection,” Morgan said, “and everything that I went through with my business happened for a reason.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for staying tenacious: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember your purpose and find motivation there. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think creatively about how to use the resources and tools at your disposal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set boundaries so you have the energy and confidence to continue on during tough times. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Connect with others</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with fellow entrepreneurs and professionals in your field can boost your business, leading to higher revenue and happier customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find one or two organizations that align with your purpose, join them, be an active member, and provide your own insights and values,” Sjahli said. “Over time, they can be your champions and bring in future leads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to team up with other businesses for product launches or mutually beneficial marketing campaigns. “Don’t underestimate the power of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collaborations. They can take your company to the next level,” Morgan said. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips for connecting: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join a professional group in your industry. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give back to an organization related to your mission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/collaborate-community-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to other business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Adopt a learning attitude</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.” – Padmasree Warrior, Founder, President, and CO at Fable</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t succeed in business if you’re not willing to learn. Prioritizing </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-marketing-agency-blogs-follow-inspiration-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts you ahead of the curve. It keeps you humble and adaptable, introduces you to new ideas and perspectives, and helps you stay up to date on industry trends and shifting </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a little bit of effort goes a long way. “Be one percent better every day,” said Sjahli. “Aim high and long-term, but take small steps forward every day.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips to prioritize learning: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get curious about the different aspects of running your business—from product development to customer service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep up with the news in your industry.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask to shadow your employees to learn what they do on a daily basis. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a course or seminar.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for conferences and events in your field. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Ask for help </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. Always be cultivating a support network so that when you stumble—and you will—they’ll be there to catch you.” – </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ladies-get-paid-founder-claire-wasserman-helps-women-entrepreneurs-thrive/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Wasserman</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO and Founder of Ladies Get Paid</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a business isn’t a one-person job. Even if you’re a sole proprietor, it’s still crucial to lean on other people for support and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-best-advice-for-new-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As business owners, sometimes we believe we’re supposed to have all the answers, but the truth is, asking for help is what makes you a great business owner,” Morgan said. “Knowing your strengths and bringing in people to help you with your weaknesses is vital in building a great company.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for asking for help: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask other successful business owners for advice. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smart, capable team members. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource work you don’t have the time or bandwidth to take on. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Invest in financial knowledge</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run a sustainable, profitable business, you have to invest in your own financial knowledge. Understanding your business’s financials is the first step to pricing your offerings correctly, setting realistic revenue goals, planning for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and securing funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth requires you to know your company’s financial health and to have financial visibility of the future,” Sjahli said, “which means you must understand the story behind your balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow.” </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to improve your financial knowledge: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take an active interest in your company’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, revenue, and profit margin.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set goals with financial targets in mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building powerful businesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or a successful business owner, there’s always room to learn and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Unsurprisingly, the impact of Covid-19 was substantial; the </span><a href="https://cdn.www.nwbc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/21113833/2020-NWBC-Annual-Report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Women’s Business Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NWBC) says the number of women-owned small businesses fell by 25 percent in the early days of the pandemic. Fortunately, it looks like that downturn is in the past. The Enterprising Investor says, “</span><a href="https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2020/10/08/the-future-is-female-covid-19-fuels-a-surge-in-women-entrepreneurs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future is female</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and points to pre-pandemic statistics that show women-owned businesses (particularly startups) “may be bigger than we think.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the latest statistics we have about female business owners from the </span><a href="https://cdn.www.nwbc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/21113833/2020-NWBC-Annual-Report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NWBC Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show they own 42 percent of all businesses in the U.S. (that’s about 13 million female entrepreneurs), employ 9.4 million people, and earn $1.9 trillion in revenues. Even the female business owners who had no employees had total revenues of more than $229 billion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of owning a business as a woman</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons a woman can benefit from owning a business. Perhaps most importantly, it gets you away from the glass ceiling that still limits how much money women in business can earn and how high they can rise at many corporations in the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified as a woman business owner</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many women, entrepreneurship is the means to a limitless future. So how can you take advantage of that? One way is to get certified. If you’re a female business owner, getting your business certified offers several benefits, including increasing your company’s visibility, gaining access to opportunities you might not otherwise have, and securing the chance to win corporate or government contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of certification as a woman-owned business:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s Business Enterprise (WBE): This designation is used by private sector organizations and many state and local governments seeking women-owned companies to conduct business with.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB): This designation is used by federal government agencies looking for women-owned companies to do business with. The Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) is a subcategory of WOSBs for those that meet the criteria for being economically disadvantaged.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, the federal government set a goal of awarding at least 25 percent of federal contracts for small businesses and five percent for female business owners. Women business owners can, of course, compete for any type of federal government contracts. But some contract opportunities are only available to female business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to compete for federal contracts, check out the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/women-owned-small-business-federal-contracting-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WOSB (Women-Owned Small Businesses) federal contracting program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As noted above, certain women entrepreneurs may also be eligible to be certified as Economically Disadvantaged WOSBs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The certification process for WOSBs and EDWOSBs has recently changed, making it “easier for qualified small businesses to participate” in the program by improving the customer experience, according to the SBA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out about the free certification process by going to this SBA </span><a href="https://beta.certify.sba.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/SBA_WOSB_Table_508_v8.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about your options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or get </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/SBA-WOSB-FAQ-2021-508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">answers to FAQs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And there’s a lot more information in the </span><a href="https://beta.certify.sba.gov/knowledgebase/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beta.Certify Knowledge Base.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private companies doing business with the federal government may be required to contract with a certain percentage of women-owned businesses. Getting certified as a WBE can give your small business an advantage against bigger businesses when trying to land these contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As recently as late 2020, businesses were able to self-certify; however, you can no longer do so. Businesses must go through an approved third-party organization or the SBA website at </span><a href="http://www.certify.sba.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certify.sba.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some organizations can help you with the WBE or WOSB certification process, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://ephcc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Paso Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.nwboc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Women Business Owners Corporation</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.uswcc.org/certification"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Women’s Chamber of Commerce</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.wbenc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each organization has specific guidelines, depending on the type of certification you’re seeking. To qualify for WOSB certification, your business must:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be a small business as defined by the SBA (size of the company may vary by NAICS code)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by women who are U.S. citizens</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have women manage day-to-day operations and also make long-term decisions</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify as an EDWOSB, your business must:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet all the requirements of the women’s contracting program</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be owned and controlled by one or more women, each with a personal net worth less than $750,000</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be owned and controlled by one or more women, each with $350,000 or less in adjusted gross income averaged over the previous three years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be owned and controlled by one or more women, each with $6 million or less in personal assets</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get certified as a WBE by the </span><a href="https://www.wbenc.org/certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WBENC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, your company must be at least 51 percent owned, controlled, operated, and managed by a woman or women. “This means one or more women must have unrestricted control of the business, a demonstrated management of day-to-day operations, and a proportionate investment of capital or expertise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re already certified through a third party or the SBA, you’ll need to get recertified. However, for self-certified WOSBs or EDWOSBs with active WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside contracts (those contracts the government has limited to or “set aside” for competition amongst small businesses only), your business is still certified throughout the life of the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to certifying female-owned businesses, some certification organizations offer member benefits such as educational programs, conferences, networking events, and matchmaking opportunities.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women business owners and money</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has long been a struggle for female business owners. In 2021, female founders secured just 2 percent of all </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/women-founders-raised-just-2-of-venture-capital-money-last-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;">venture capitalist (VC) funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. And while it’s a few years old, the stats shown in the last report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, </span><a href="https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2/5/25bd7ee9-a37b-4d2b-a91a-8b1ad6f5bd58/536DC6E705BBAD3B555BFA4B60DEA025.sbc-tackling-the-gender-gap.december-2017-final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21st Century Barriers to Women’s Entrepreneurship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have not changed all that much. That report showed women received only 16 percent of all conventional small business loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a female-owned business looking for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have several options, including:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NerdWallet just named the “</span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/small-business/small-business-loans-for-women"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best small-business loans for women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/small-business/fundbox-small-business-loans?trk_channel=web&amp;trk_element=hyperlink&amp;trk_location=MarketplaceReviewLink&amp;trk_nldt=undefined&amp;trk_pagetype=roundup&amp;trk_sectionCategory=Recap&amp;trk_topic=Small%20Business%20Loans&amp;trk_vertical=Small%20Business&amp;mpdid=179ac878aff864-07162ab83cb0b3-37607201-1aeaa0-179ac878b00b04"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is proud to be on that list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not directly issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business loans but works with partner lenders to guarantee loans. SBA lending programs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7(a) loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is the SBA’s most common loan program and has a maximum loan amount of $5 million.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/504-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">504 loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These loans are available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs), which are the SBA’s community-based partners. The CDC/504 Loan Program provides long-term, fixed-rate financing of up to $5 million. To be eligible for a 504 Loan, your business must: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operate as a for-profit company in the United States or its possessions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a tangible net worth of less than $15 million</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have an average net income of less than $5 million after federal income taxes for the two years preceding your application</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/microloans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are small business loans of less than $50,000. Each lender sets its own lending and credit requirements for microloans, and usually, some type of collateral and the personal guarantee of the business owner are required.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants for women</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike small business loans for women, grants don’t have to be paid back, making them an excellent way for female business owners to get money. However, there is heavy competition for grants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you apply for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/business-grants-for-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant for women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be sure to do your due diligence. Carefully check the eligibility requirements and make sure to file your application on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some grant programs for female business owners to look into:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ambergrantsforwomen.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amber Grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The $10,000 Amber Grants from WomensNet are awarded monthly. One of the 12 monthly winners also receives an additional $25,000 Amber Grant.</span></p>

The winner gets $7,500 in startup capital and $1,000 in merchandise. Award application ends August 1st, 2022.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.toryburchfoundation.org/fellows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tory Burch Fellows Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Founded by design entrepreneur Tory Burch, the program chooses up to 50 Fellows annually, who each receive a $5,000 grant, access to a private online peer community, and a trip to Tory Burch headquarters for five days of networking and workshops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many local grants for women are also available, including:</span></p>
<ul>

Many of the grants found here are for nonprofit organizations; however, there are some available for-profit businesses.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.grants.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a central clearinghouse for information about federal government grants.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there tax benefits to being a woman-owned business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see from the information above, there are many beneficial programs and supports that make it worthwhile being a woman in business today; however, tax breaks do not factor into the equation. Neither the federal nor state governments give any special consideration to women-owned businesses when it comes to the tax code.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources for women entrepreneurs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another benefit of having a woman-owned business is the support and help you can get. Women business owners tend to be very collaborative, so don’t hesitate to ask other </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/lessons-women-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">female business owners for advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also get help from your local </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance/sbdc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Development Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SBDC),</span><a href="https://www.score.org/find-mentor"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SCORE office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  </span><a href="https://awbc.org/wbc-locator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s Business Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ascent.sba.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ascent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new learning platform from the SBA, and the SBA’s </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-locations/headquarters-offices/office-womens-business-ownership"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of Women’s Business Ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the case of each of these entities, the main goal is to help empower female business owners.</span></p>

In the U.S., minorities make up 32 percent of the population,</span><a href="https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/minorityentrepreneurs#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%2010%20years,totaling%20close%20to%20%24700%20billion."><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but only 18 percent of business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority business owners face their own set of unique obstacles when running their businesses. From access to education to equity, communication, and cultural factors, there are several systemic barriers that can create challenges for minority business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://archive.mbda.gov/page/executive-summary-disparities-capital-access-between-minority-and-non-minority-businesses.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed by the Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency found that sufficient access to capital remains a key factor in limiting the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority-owned businesses. Findings from the same report showed that minority-owned businesses are less likely to receive funding and, if approved, receive smaller loans and higher interest rates than their non-minority counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority business owners are often faced with more institutional barriers to funding, such as limited banking options, insufficient credit history, and implicit bias. In addition, minority business owners are less likely to apply for funding due to </span><a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/breaking-barriers-to-credit-and-capital-access-for-black-latinx-and-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fear of rejection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can mean they miss out on equal funding opportunities or resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding what financing options are available can help business owners during difficult times and times of growth. There are different programs and loans designed specifically for minority-owned businesses. These options can provide a vital source of funding to help traditionally underserved communities launch or grow an existing business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding Funding for Minority-Owned Businesses</span></h2>
<h4><b>Loans vs. grants</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans refer to money borrowed with the expectation of paying it back (most often with interest) over a set and agreed-upon period of time. Loans are broadly available and offer flexibility in terms of eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants offer funding with no expectation of repayment; however, they are less common than loans. Because they are few and far between, business owners can expect most grant programs to be highly competitive. </span></p>
<h4><b>What are loans for minority-owned businesses? </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are loans that are specifically designated for businesses owned and operated by minorities, designed to increase funding access to traditionally underserved communities. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to minority-owned business loans. There are many options, and loans are available from a variety of different providers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of these loans is to level the playing field for minority-owned businesses and improve their chances of accessing the necessary capital to start, operate, or grow their businesses.</span></p>
<h4><b>What you need to qualify for a minority-owned business loan</b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business must be minority-owned. That usually means a business must be at least 51 percent owned or operated by a person belonging to Black, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian, or other racial or ethnic group(s).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some federal loans and programs for minorities require your business to first apply for and obtain </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority business enterprise certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprofits and other entities that are not connected with the government also create and extend loans. Loan qualification requirements vary depending on the loan and the lender.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these programs and loans require lengthy applications and paperwork, plus a high FICO (credit) score or collateral. In some cases, you’re only eligible for financing with a business history of at least two years.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Minority-Owned Business Loans to Consider</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you Google ‘minority-owned business loans,’ you’ll find pages and pages of results. Seeking out the right loan for your business can be overwhelming. There are a variety of options available, but as with other types of financing, eligibility and terms vary. Some are more favorable than others. Here are some of the best minority loan options to consider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Small Business Administration is a federal entity created to foster small business growth. </span></p>
<h4><b>SBA Community Advantage Loans</b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/partners/lenders/7a-loan-program/pilot-loan-programs#section-header-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA Community Advantage (CA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loans help small businesses in underserved markets. Under this pilot program, minority-owned businesses can receive up to $250,000 with a maximum interest rate of prime plus six percent. The SBA guarantees 85 percent for loans up to $150,000, and 75 percent for loans larger than $150,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA CA loan terms vary depending on how you use the funds: Loan terms for equipment and working capital may extend up to 10 years, while those for real estate may extend up to 25 years. These loans are a decent option for new businesses, as well as those with below-average credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To apply for a CA loan you’ll need to contact an </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/support-carl-lenders-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved lender in your area.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Approved lenders include community development corporations, SBA-authorized microloan providers, and community development financial institutions. </span></p>
<h4><b>SBA Microloans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/loans-grants/see-what-sba-offers/sba-loan-programs/microloan-program%20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are open to all businesses, but are a good option for new minority small business owners or those seeking loans of $50,000 or less. The SBA microloan program offers up to $50,000 with seven-year maximum terms and interest rates typically ranging from 6 percent to 9 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These microloans are made available through third-party lenders. To apply, you must work with an </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/microlenderrpt5_20170621.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA-approved intermediary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. Approved intermediaries make all credit decisions on SBA microloans.</span></p>
<h4><b>SBA 7(a) Loans</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7(a) loan program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the SBA&#8217;s primary program for providing financial assistance to small businesses. The program is not designed specifically for minorities; however, a third of the 7(a) loans go to minority-owned businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rates on SBA 7(a) loans are some of the lowest you’ll find, allowing minority business owners to invest more profits in growth rather than paying off debt. You can qualify for up to $5 million with a repayment term of between 10 and 25 years. To apply for a 7(a) loan, you need to complete an application with an SBA lending partner, like a bank or credit union. The lender will submit your application to the SBA to receive a loan guarantee; this way, if you are unable to pay the loan, the SBA will repay the guaranteed amount to the lender.</span></p>
<h4><b>SBA 8(a) Business Development Program</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not technically a loan, the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 8(a) Business Development Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps minority-owned businesses gain access to federal contracts. Each year, the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-minorities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program’s goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to award at least 5 percent of federal contracting dollars to small, underserved businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program is a valuable resource for minority small business owners who have been in business for at least two years and are interested in expanding their footprint in the federal marketplace. To qualify for this program, the business must be 51 percent owned by someone from a socially and economically underserved background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the applicant business owner’s personal net worth and average gross income for the last three years must be $250,000 or less, with assets valued at $4 million or less. Businesses interested in applying for 8(a) certification can take a preliminary assessment </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program#section-header-6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine whether the 8(a) program is right for them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprofit Loans</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not always minority-specific, there are many nonprofit organizations that offer loans to small businesses. </span></p>
<h4><b>The Business Consortium Fund (BCF)</b></h4>
<p><a href="https://bcfcapital.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BCF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit organization and community development financial institution (CDFI). The BCF provides financing exclusively for minority business owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loans range from $100,000 to $750,000 with a maximum loan term of five years — interest rates depend on the risk analysis. To be eligible, you must certify your business as a minority business enterprise through the </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></a></p>
<h4><b>The Accion Opportunity Fund (AOF)</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://aofund.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AOF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supports small businesses that advance racial, gender, and economic justice. This program offers loans from $5,000 to $100,000 and interest rates as low as 5.99 percent. AOF loans are targeted at low- to moderate-income business owners and 60 percent of AOF borrowers come from minority communities. </span></p>
<h4><b>Kiva </b></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.kiva.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit organization and technology platform that enables crowdfunded loans for borrowers who are either financially excluded or creating social impact in their communities. Eligible business owners can qualify for </span><a href="https://www.kivaushub.org/kivaprocess"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to $15,000 in no-interest financing.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Loan Options for Minority Small Businesses</span></p>
<h4><b>Accompany Capital</b></h4>
<p><a href="http://www.nybcna.org/bcna/microloans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accompany Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides short-term loans up to $50,000 to minority business owners based in New York City. They offer low, fixed interest rates, but loans must be paid back within six months to three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses are eligible, and there is no minimum credit score required to qualify for these minority business loans.</span></p>
<h4><b>The Union Bank Diversity Lending Program</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><a href="https://www.unionbank.com/business/lending/diversity-lending"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers up to $2.5 million in financing that is specifically designated for businesses that are at least 51 percent owned by women, veterans, and minority business owners. To qualify, businesses must be in operation for two years or more and annual sales cannot exceed $20 million. The program provides flexible loan types and terms; however, it’s limited to businesses operating in Arizona, California, Oregon, or Washington only. </span></p>
<h4><b> United States Department of Agriculture business loans</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Agriculture </span><a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/resources/federal/federal-funding/department-agriculture-business-and-industry-bi-guaranteed-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guarantees business loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for small businesses, companies, nonprofits, and other organizations located in rural communities. These loans are not tailored exclusively to minority-owned businesses, but can be a valuable option for those based in rural areas. The maximum loan amount is $10 million, and terms can differ based on how the funds are used. Interest rates are set by the lender but must fall within a maximum limit set by the USDA. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are loans specifically for minority businesses, many business owners do not have time to wait for these options. Many of these programs and loans require lengthy applications and paperwork, as well as a high FICO score or collateral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in fast and flexible credit, explore Fundbox’s funding options, including business lines of credit and term loans. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_645371266-768x512.jpeg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="3 Black business owners researching how to become a certified Minority Business Enterprise" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_645371266-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_645371266.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you identify as a minority small business owner, you know firsthand how systemic barriers pose challenges to growing your business. However, getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) can help you overcome some of these challenges by giving you access to programs that provide professional connections and resources that can help strengthen your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a certified MBE, you’ll have more opportunities to bid for both corporate and federal business contracts. You can also be eligible for funding, such as grants, and participate in business development training. In this article, we’ll look at the different avenues for certification and how they can benefit your business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Minority Business Enterprise?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Minority Business Enterprise is most commonly defined as a company that is at least 51 percent owned and operated by an individual who is a U.S. citizen and is at least 25 percent African American, Asian American, Pacific Islander, Latinx or Hispanic, or Native American descent. If the company is publicly traded, there can be requirements that enforce shareholder and employee diversity, as well. Oftentimes, a publicly traded company must be at least 51 percent minority-owned, and the core management and operations of the company must be controlled by team members who are part of these minority groups. The business must also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be a for-profit enterprise and physically located in the U.S. or its trust territories.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting an MBE certification can support your business strategy by opening up additional opportunities for you to secure funding and drive revenue.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of the major advantages to getting your business certified as an MBE:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Network expansion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with other MBEs for potential joint-venture and partnership opportunities. Take advantage of programs that get your business in front of potential customers and procurement professionals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Education and business advisory: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get access to professional development programs and support to expand your business skill set, including resources like technical training, mentorship, and marketing assistance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Federal contracts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many federal agencies are required to give a certain number of contracts to certified minority-owned businesses. Certification means you can compete for these contracts and connect with advisors who can help you navigate the process. This can open up your business to new opportunities and important relationships you might not have found otherwise. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to funding: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are programs available across the country to help minority-owned businesses receive access to capital they might not otherwise be able to generate from their own networks. These programs provide grants and loans that can help you reach your business goals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Incentivizes investment and partnership:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Both state and federal tax benefits are available to other businesses that engage with MBE-certified organizations. There are also tax benefits for working with organizations that employ minorities. However, there are </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/finance/minority-owned-businesses-taxes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no tax benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically for certified MBEs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get certified as a Minority Business Enterprise </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple ways to get an MBE certification. The most common programs include: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Small Business Administration (SBA) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local programs </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s some overlap between each of these options, but it’s a good idea to understand the differences to get the most benefit for your business. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through the National Minority Supplier Development Council</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) is considered the gold standard for ensuring supplier diversity in the private sector. This certification program is great for businesses that want to connect with private corporations to do contract work with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside the MBE certification, the NMSDC offers opportunities for you to access financial and educational resources and expand your professional networks. </span></p>
<p><b>Key benefits of certification with the NMSDC</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business listing in the regional and national minority supplier database. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking opportunities with over 12,000 fellow MBEs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities to reach and win contracts with over 1,400 large corporate members, including companies like Accenture, Apple, Bank of America, Delta Airlines, Google, UnitedHealth Group, Walmart, and Walt Disney Company.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to funding opportunities through their Business Consortium Fund, the Growth Initiative Program, and the Capital Manager’s Program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing access to technical and leadership training.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How to apply for an MBE certification through the NMSDC</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to being at least 51 percent owned by minority individuals, the NMSDC requires that your business is a for-profit enterprise, and the management and daily operations must be done by minority ownership members. </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/what-is-an-mbe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a full overview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their criteria for identifying minority-owned businesses to see if you qualify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NMSDC has an online application process through </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/mbes/mbe-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but before you get started, you’ll need to get in touch with the </span><a href="https://nmsdc.org/our-network/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional affiliate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s closest to your business’ headquarters. They will guide you through the application process and ensure you’re compliant with the standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire certification process can take up to 90 days to complete, and you’ll have to wait for final approval from both the board and committee members. If your application is approved, they’ll notify you by email and postal mail. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through the Small Business Administration</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to succeed in the public sector—winning contracts with federal, state, and local government bodies—you could benefit from the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Business Development program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government has a goal to spend at least 5 percent of its contracting dollars on businesses with the 8(a) designation. To take part in the 8(a) program, your business has to be at least 51 percent directly owned and controlled by U.S. citizens who qualify as socially or economically disadvantaged in the </span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR4ef1291a4a984ab/section-124.103"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Federal Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Key benefits of the SBA 8(a) designation</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ability to compete for </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-guide/types-contracts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public sector contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compete for contracts through additional socio-economic programs. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to an SBA Business Opportunity Specialist to help you navigate the federal contracting processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities to form joint ventures with other businesses through the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/sba-mentor-protege-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA Mentor-Protégé Program.</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receive ongoing management and technical assistance, including business training, counseling, marketing assistance, and executive development.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>How to apply for the SBA 8(a) program </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can apply for the SBA 8(a) program online through </span><a href="https://certify.sba.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certify.SBA.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, unlike the NMSDC’s regional affiliate structure, the SBA doesn’t offer application support. Keep in mind that it may take a significant amount of time and resources to put together an application yourself. There are several consulting firms available to hire to help you organize your documents and ensure that your application has a good chance of being approved. Before you dive in, the SBA also provides a </span><a href="https://certify.sba.gov/am-i-eligible"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary assessment tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can use to quickly see if the program is right for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A full outline of the steps you need to take to apply can be found on the </span><a href="https://sbaone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CHDB/pages/1294172161/Prepare+and+Submit+Your+8+a+Initial+Application"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certify knowledge base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Here are some of the major requirements you need to meet to be eligible for the 8(a) Business Development Program:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to qualify under the SBA </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/size-standards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small business standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you apply and throughout the nine-year program. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business cannot have previously participated in the 8(a) program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have the financial capacity to perform ‌federal contracts successfully.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot owe any outstanding federal financial obligations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business is owned by someone with a personal net worth of $250,000 or less.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner has an average adjusted gross income of $250,000 or less for three years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner has $4 million or less in assets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business is accepted into the program, you’ll receive a mailed letter within 90 days from the SBA informing you that your application was approved. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting certified through state and local programs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to NMSDC and SBA certifications, there are also several MBE certification programs that are intended to help connect companies with state and local government contracts that are set aside for minority-owned businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of state-level certification programs include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.mbocolorado.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado: Minority Business Office</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/DAS/Procurement/Supplier-Diversity/SBE-MBE-Program-Certification-Application-Small-or-Minority-Business-Enterprise"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecticut: Supplier Diversity Program</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://gmsdc.org/get-certified/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia: Minority Business Enterprise Certification</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://hidot.hawaii.gov/administration/ocr/dbe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawaii: Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.development.ohio.gov/bs/bs_mbac_cert.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio: Minority &amp; Small Business Certification</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.businessexpress.ny.gov/app/answers/cms/a_id/3209"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York: NYS Minority and Women Business Development (MWBE) Program</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find out if your state offers similar programs via </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/minority-business-development.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this directory.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for local certification programs on your municipality’s website. Typically, these resources are found in the economic development section or certification section and list programs available for local minority-owned businesses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do women-owned businesses qualify as MBEs? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the NMSDC doesn’t have certifications specifically for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women-owned businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.wbenc.org/certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s Business Enterprise National Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (WBENC) is a non-profit organization that provides the most widely recognized certification for women-owned businesses in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of being certified are similar to the NMSDC program, including access to a network of other private-sector companies and the potential to reach procurement executives at major organizations. Educational support and marketing assistance are also available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of the SBA 8(a) program, women-owned businesses still need to qualify as being economically disadvantaged under their criteria. You can take a look at the examples in this section of the </span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/chapter-I/part-124/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR4ef1291a4a984ab/section-124.103"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Federal Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if you qualify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that the SBA offers a </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/women-owned-small-business-federal-contracting-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contracting program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, this program is similar to the SBA 8(a) program in terms of requirements and benefits. If you are both a woman and qualify as an economically disadvantaged individual, you can be certified as an Economically Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB). </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final thoughts </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, minority business owners have faced challenges in accessing </span><a href="https://www.biz2credit.com/research-reports/minority-owned-businesses-express-optimism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and winning large contracts. During the pandemic, the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program also presented issues with equitable distribution of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/minority-business-ppp/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP funds to minority small businesses.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a certified MBE, you’ll have access to favorable contract opportunities, marketing assistance, and other valuable resources like business training and mentorship. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="American soldier flag patch" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_417541450.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not easy for soldiers to leave the battlefield and transition back to civilian life. Many veterans struggle with finding a job where they feel satisfied. Returning to a conventional job can feel challenging: it’s one thing to follow orders to protect the freedom of the nation; it’s another to be told what to do by a manager. Instead, many veterans decide to pursue entrepreneurship to become their own bosses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans play a vital role in the economic stability of the private sector. In fact, </span><a href="https://smallbusiness.com/resources/military-owned-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of businesses in the U.S. are veteran-owned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, like other small business owners, as a veteran, you may struggle with the same challenges that come with launching and running a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="http://veteranbusinesscoalition.org/the-death-and-rebirth-of-veteran-entrepreneurship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coalition for Veteran-Owned Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly 25% of veterans want to start a business; however, a mere 6% actually go through with it. Why? Because the reality is that veterans don’t have enough access to financing and the resources to help them acquire the capital and training they need to start a business successfully. Sadly for the veterans who start their businesses with personal and family savings, it’s often not enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are loans designed specifically for veterans through the Small Business Administration (SBA). There are also other small business loan </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/facts-veterans-and-entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">options for veteran entrepreneurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are ideal for start-ups, fast cash, working capital, and financing for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best loans and financing opportunities available for veterans:</span></p>
<h2>1. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA offers several small business financing options reserved for veterans. Here are two examples of veterans-only loans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/disaster-assistance/military-reservist-loan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">MREIDL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available to military reservists whose business’s financial goals were unmet because an essential employee was called up to active duty. The loan is a temporary source of financing to cover operating expenses until the reservist is discharged.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SBA Veterans Advantage Program:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The VA loan typically has lower rates and fees compared to traditional loans. Under the</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/articles/Veterans_Advantage_Borrower_Fact_Sheet_FY17_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA veterans advantage program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can get up to $150,000 with no upfront fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Most members of the regular military, National Guard, reservists, and veterans are eligible to apply for a VA loan. Specifically, to qualify for a VA business loan, the business must be 51% owned and controlled by one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An honorably discharged veteran</li>
<li>A service-disabled veteran</li>
<li>An active-duty military member participating in the military Transition Assistance Program</li>
<li>A reservist or member of the National Guard</li>
<li>A spouse of any of the above</li>
<li>A widowed spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or from injuries sustained as a result of their service</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Veteran-specific financial groups</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran-specific financial groups aim to make it easier for military members to obtain the funds they need to grow their businesses. Here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://hiversandstrivers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Hivers and Strivers</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hivers and Strivers is an angel funding firm that funds early-stage companies founded by graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, or Merchant Marine Academy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.streetshares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Streetshares Foundation</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In addition to short-term loans, the foundation offers monthly grants and loans for veteran-owned businesses (or ones run by their spouses), prioritizing businesses based on their social impact and the strength of their business idea. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://bunkerlabs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Bunker Labs</b></a><b>: </b>Bunker Labs is a nonprofit organization that provides access to a national network of veteran and milspouse entrepreneurs dedicated to helping veterans and others in their transitioning military community start their own business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Traditional banking institutions</h2>
<p>Traditional financial institutions are options for veterans who have solid credit scores. Unfortunately, over the last several years, banks have signed off on fewer and fewer business loans. In fact, banks only approved 25.3% of the small business loans that came their way in 2018.</p>
<h2>4. Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and AngelList are some of the best crowdfunding sites for small businesses. This option is ideal for veteran entrepreneurs who are building products or creating services. Crowdfunding connects entrepreneurs to donors and investors who believe in the veteran’s project or business idea.</p>
<p><em>Considering crowdfunding? Here are 5 <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pros and cons of crowdfunding your business</a>.</em></p>
<h2>5. Invoice factoring and invoice financing</h2>
<p>Does your business have a lot of unpaid invoices? With invoice factoring, you can sell them at a discount, giving your fast cash and saving you the time you’d spend tracking down your clients to pay up. With this option, you forgo a chunk of your revenues since the invoice factoring company owns your invoices and therefore, collects payments directly from your customers.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting some funds from your accounts receivable, but you would rather maintain control of your relationship with those customers, check out a similar option, called invoice financing.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn about how</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/invoice-factoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-invoice-financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice financing</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differ and what they can offer.</span></i></p>
<h2>6. Business lines of credit</h2>
<p>Unlike other forms of financing, you don’t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you actually use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process for applying and getting a line of credit varies depending on which firm you work with, but the internet and AI technology have combined to dramatically speed it up in recent years. With alternative lenders like </span><strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> that offer business lines of credit</strong>, you can secure credit limits of up to $100,000 that you can repay over 12 or 24 weeks via auto debit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Fundbox, you can apply online without any paperwork to get started, and can expect a credit decision </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in as little as 3 minutes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">Education and training for  veteran entrepreneurs </span></h2>
<p>There are also amazing organizations and programs that aim to educate and train veterans to become entrepreneurs:</p>

Historically, Minority-owned (in particular Black-owned) businesses have faced the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/federal-reserve-banks-small-business-credit-survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most difficulty when it comes to securing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially during the start-up phase. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2018 report, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/25/minority-entrepreneurs-at-tipping-point-as-black-owned-banks-dwindle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SBA found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that &#8220;Reliance on personal and family savings are the most common sources of financing, especially among Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. However, Black households’ median net worth is about a tenth of that of White households.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an entrepreneur of color and you’ve found traditional financing hasn&#8217;t worked for you, here&#8217;s a comprehensive guide covering a wide number of current financing options and other resources intended to help Black and other </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/loans-for-minorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority-owned small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (often including start-ups), ranging from Minority small business loans, to grants, to venture capitalists, to educational scholarships, and more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for minorities</span></h2>
<p><b>SBA Community Advantage (7a)</b> <b>Loans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the 7(a) loan umbrella, the SBA offers the Community Advantage Loans program, which is designed to support businesses and entrepreneurs that operate in underserved markets. Unlike many other loans, these are available only through specific </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/programs-training/Programs/cdfi-program/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community-based lenders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are enrolled in the program. Minority business owners are guaranteed up to <a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/CA%20Guide%20Version%206%20FINAL%20508%2006-01-20.pdf">75% for a $250,000 loan</a>, with interest rates of Prime + 6%.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If used for working capital, qualified businesses generally have 10 years to repay the loan, plus interest. This program has been extended until September 30, 2022.</span></p>
<p><b>SBA Microloan</b> <b>program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Available to almost anyone, SBA </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microloans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are designed to help small businesses and others start up and expand—especially those that are owned by minorities, women, and </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/offices/district/pa/pittsburgh/resources/sba-business-loan-information-veterans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veterans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SBA Microloans offer $500 to $50,000 (the average loan being $13,000) and must be repaid within 6 years, with interest rates averaging between 8% and 13%.</span></p>
<p><b>SBA&#8217;s 8(a) Business Development Program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Created to serve economically and socially disadvantaged businesses, </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the SBA 8(a) program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (while not a loan itself, per se) offers a potential advantage to minority businesses by setting aside a certain percentage of federal contracting dollars for small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged people or entities, thus limiting competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other government resources for minorities</span></h2>
<p><b>Community Development Financial Institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include more than 950 banks, credit unions, and other lenders who can access and distribute US Treasury Department funds that are specially-earmarked for minority and economically distressed communities. The </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDFI Fund&#8217;s searchable database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can direct you to certified CDFI lenders in your area who have received funds through such award programs as the Bank Enterprise Award Program (BEA) and Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian (NACA).</span></p>
<p><b>Minority Business Development Agency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> (MBDA) Business Center.</strong> An agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/mbda-programs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBDA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “promotes the growth of minority-owned businesses”. They offer various </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/grants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted grants and loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> throughout the year, such as the “Entrepreneurship Education Program for Formerly Incarcerated Persons Grant” and an “Enterprising Women of Color Grant Competition.” They offer educational services too, such as </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/mbda-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBDA Business Centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, located around the country, to help advise Minority-owned firms seeking to grow, penetrate new markets, and learn about securing capital, competing for a contract, identifying a strategic partner, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>The National Minority Supplier Development Council Business Consortium Fund</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a Community Development Financial Institution, the </span><a href="https://bcfcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Consortium Fund (BCF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers minority business owners a variety of programs. Through their Direct Lending Program, minority business owners can borrow between $100,000 and $750,000, either in the form of a term loan or a business line of credit. To be eligible, you must </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-certified-minority-business-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certify your business as a minority business enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority Funds and Loans from Nonprofit and Private Organizations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous private companies and organizations who can provide funding alternatives for business owners of color.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Accion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a nonprofit that offers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority entrepreneurs term loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranging from $300 to $1,000,000 for both established businesses and start-ups, with fixed rates from 7% to 34% APR (depending on your credit score and other factors).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Consortium Fund</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BCF) Direct Lending Program caters to minority entrepreneurs who have been operating for 3 years but have been unable to secure financing through traditional channels. <a href="https://bcfcapital.com/loan-facilities/">Loans are available</a> from $100,000 to $750,000. Eligibility requires your business to be certified through the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), but nonprofits are ineligible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Union Bank’s Business Diversity Lending Program</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide </span><a href="https://www.unionbank.com/business/lending/diversity-lending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loans of up to $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to minority or women business owners. To be eligible, your company must be at least 51% minority, woman, or veteran owned, have been open for at least two years, and have annual sales below $20 million.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-level funding programs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More localized (and hence, less competitive) funding programs for minority and women-owned businesses may also be available in your area. For example: </span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business grants for Minorities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous business grants are available for Black and minority-owned businesses. Applying for a grant (particularly if it&#8217;s a federal grant) can be a very meticulous process, so here are some </span><a href="https://www.federalgrantswire.com/tips-on-applying-for-federal-grants.html#.X401N2hKiUk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tips for success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A good place to start looking for grants your business may be eligible for is to search for current programs listed on </span><a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Grants.gov</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of some minority-focused grants include: </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority-based venture capital </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common route for tech-focused and some ecommerce start-ups, venture capital currently distributes a mere 3% of funding to Black founders, and of that, less than 1% goes to Black female founders.

After multiple rounds of federal funding that expired in August of 2020—but just renewed again on December 27th—how well has the the PPP serve minority businesses so far? According to some </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/09/coronavirus-ppp-may-have-left-minority-business-owners-behind.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, community leaders, and even </span><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/04/21/rep-meeks-on-how-small-business-funds-are-missing-minority-communities-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">members of Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: not well enough.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of December 27, 2020, Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a><span style="font-size: 18px;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span> </span></h4>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minority businesses matter </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Minority Supplier Development Council (</span><a href="https://www.nmsdc.org/wp-content/uploads/Economic_Impact_Report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NMSDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), there are more than 4 million minority-owned businesses, employing more than</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 million people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and generating over</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$400 billion in annual revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-08/black-business-owners-suffer-41-drop-in-covid-19-lockdowns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bureau of Economic Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that the coronavirus shutdown has hurt African American businesses the most among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. </span><b>There was a 41% decline in black-owned businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from February to April, 2020. That was two months before this writing, and the economic impact still continues.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the PPP to those who need it most</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When its second round of PPP funding was signed into law in late April, nearly $60 billion was earmarked for small and medium sized financial institutions. However, the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/SBA_OIG_Report_20-14_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Inspector General&#8217;s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faulted the Small Business Administration&#8217;s initial guidance in fulfilling its promise to prioritize underserved communities for the PPP, writing, “These borrowers, including rural, minority and women owned businesses, may not have received the loans as intended.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without such guidance or accountability </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(and because demographic information is not collected as part of the PPP process, aside from the option to select Tribal business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), there were few tools to measure or enforce how well the PPP supported these minority communities. So the SBA dedicated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds to small financial institutions in the hope of reaching</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small, rural and minority-owned businesses. Their policy was to </span><a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2020/04/30/community-bank-helps-hundreds-of-small-businesses-access-ppp-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">divide them evenly between financial institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with less than $10 billion in assets and those with $10 billion to $50 billion. These would include community banks, regional banks, credit unions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Treasury also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved the likelihood that PPP funds would be directed to smaller businesses more in need of assistance by adding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the requirement that applicants certify in good faith that they had no additional sources of capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new stipulation works in the favor of minority-owned businesses and entrepreneurs, who have characteristically lower access to capital and credit. “Black entrepreneurs are nearly three times more likely as white entrepreneurs to have business growth and profitability negatively impacted by a lack of capital,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/report/america-s-opportunity-gaps-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who report that 70.6% of Black entrepreneurs rely on personal and family savings.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for sole proprietors  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding resources for sole proprietors and independent contractors are especially critical, because minority business owners are less likely to employ workers. Statistics from the SBA show that </span><b>96% of black-owned businesses are non-employee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, versus 79% of white-owned businesses. The term &#8220;paycheck&#8221; in the title of the PPP may have caused some confusion among both banks and business owners as to the eligibility of self-employed persons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, 2020, the SBA and the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued final guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explaining how the PPP loan can work for sole proprietors and independent contractors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most independent contractors, calculating your PPP borrowing limit is a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/uscc_coronavirus_independent-contractors.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-step process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Find line 7</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (gross income) on your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (If you haven’t filed yet for 2019, go ahead and fill it out). If the amount on Line 7 is over $100,000, write $100,000.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Effective March 8, 2021, most lenders will now accept line 7 (gross income instead of line 31, net income, as previously required).</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divide the amount from Step 1 by 12.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiply the amount from Step 2 by 2.5 (or 3.5 if your business is in the Food Services or Accommodations industry).

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress report on the PPP</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://smallbusinessmajority.org/sites/default/files/research-reports/Survey-Small-business-owners-worried-about-PPP-loan-forgiveness.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2020 survey by the Small Business Majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported these findings on PPP applications up to May 27th:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63% of Black and Latino small business owners applied for a PPP loan (compared to 69% of all small businesses).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63% of those who applied were approved for financing (compared to 73% of all small businesses).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 30% of all respondents who did not apply for the PPP said that they did not seek financing because they were concerned the loan would not be forgiven.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19% said they were told (or believed) they would not qualify.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12% could not find a bank to apply for a PPP loan.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="http://publications.unidosus.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/2051/UnidosUS-Color-Of-Change-Federal-Simulus-Survey-Findings.pdf?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by UNIDOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found an even greater divide in PPP applications, with minorities asking for less funding than other businesses—and receiving even less than they sought. According to the May 2020 report:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51% of Black and Latinx small business owners who sought assistance requested less than $20,000 in temporary funding from the federal government. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12% received the assistance they requested. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41% reported receiving no PPP funds. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previously mentioned </span><a href="https://smallbusinessmajority.org/sites/default/files/research-reports/Survey-Small-business-owners-worried-about-PPP-loan-forgiveness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Majority study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that many of those who secured a loan expressed concerns with the program, with more than 80% concerned about the </span><b>rules around loan forgiveness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and having their loan forgiven. 58% specifically reported finding it challenging to spend at least 75%* of the loan on payroll. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[*Note: With the recent passage of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (PPPFA), this ratio of payroll/operating expenses has changed from 75%/25% to 60% payroll and 40% operating expenses to qualify for loan forgiveness. For details on these and other major changes to the PPP forgiveness rules, </span><b>check out our article or podcast on </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>PPP Loan Forgiveness</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.]</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better future for the PPP?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential remains for Congress to renew the PPP. If so, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hat can be done to help improve minority-owned small businesses access to these funds?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Signal-boost the PPP&#8217;s availability to sole proprietors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA&#8217;s move to open up and clarify the PPP for sole proprietors and independent contractors was a good first step, but more education and promotion efforts would help self-employed business owners, particularly in minority communities, to take advantage of the program.</span></b></li>
<li><strong>Identify and help promote the minority and community financial institutions</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MDIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ofn.org/CDFIs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDFIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as well as fintech lenders who are offering PPP loans. As the Small Business Majority revealed, 12% of businesses surveyed could not find a PPP lender. Adding to the difficulty of finding PPP lenders is the fact that </span><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25% of US households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (mostly minorities, and many of whom are self-employed) are either unbanked or underbanked, meaning they have only a basic checking/savings account or none.</span></li>
<li><strong>Simplify and improve education and clarity</strong> about the application and forgiveness process.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Based on previous surveys regarding experiences with the PPP (nearly one third did not apply because they did not understand forgiveness), one thing that could greatly help borrowers is to spread greater awareness and provide a much clearer understanding of the PPP rules for applications and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forgiveness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Much has been learned by PPP lenders like Fundbox that can improve your success in applying for a PPP loan, including </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required PPP application documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative Options for Small Business Owners</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For business owners looking for support outside of the PPP, there may be other avenues worth pursuing. See our updated list of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-business-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State-by-State COVID-19 Resources for Small Businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Beginning your search at a state level may help decrease competition to receiving funding. For example, there are programs specifically designed to aid minority-owned businesses in Iowa (</span><a href="https://www.iowaeda.com/iowa-news/governor-reynolds-announces-2-million-in-cares-act-funding-for-covid-19-nanovaccine-development-in-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Economic Development: Targeted Small Business Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and New Jersey (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Economic Development Authority: Small Business Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><a href="https://www.opportunityfund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Opportunity Fund</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a nationwide source of microloans (as well as PPP loans) for underserved small businesses, particularly those owned by low- and moderate-income immigrants, people of color, and women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

The <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FINAL%20FINAL%20CARES%20ACT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act</a> (CARES Act), which was designed to give financial relief to individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>About <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm961">$350 billion</a> of the $2 trillion stimulus package was allocated for small businesses<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help with job retention and operating costs. The package included two loan options for businesses suffering economic losses right now: the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7(a) </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paycheck Protection Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PPP) and the SBA’s </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources#section-header-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Injury Disaster Loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIDL).  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading for a breakdown of each. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paycheck Protection Program </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to incentivize business owners to keep their employees on payroll, the PPP offers eligible businesses up to $2 million in funding for payroll and operating expenses like rent and utilities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of December 27, 2020, Congress has approved additional funds for the PPP. Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <strong><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender</a></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> until May 31, 2021.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies who qualified (or will qualify) for the paycheck protection loan could get up to </span><b>two and a half times your business’s average monthly payroll costs, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">not to exceed $10 million. Payroll costs can include salaries, wages, commission, or other compensation, as well as paid leave, health insurance, retirement benefits, and payroll taxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA suggests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a main appeal of the paycheck protection loan is that it can be converted into a grant, so you might not have to pay it back. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who’s eligible for the loan? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/strategy/cares-act-small-business-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explanation of the CARES Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the The Chamber of Commerce says that businesses with fewer than 500 employees that have been operating since February 15, 2020 are eligible for the PPP loan. That includes 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations, veterans organizations, tribal organizations, sole proprietors, self-employed workers, and independent contractors who make their living getting 1099 miscellaneous invoices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses with more than 500 employees. If you’re in the food service or accommodation industries, for example, you’re eligible as long as you have fewer than 500 employees per location. This is especially good news for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/franchise-growth-thru-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">franchisees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who previously may not have qualified for an SBA loan due to the total size of the corporation, but now can apply based on the number of local employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to quickly check to see if you may qualify is to consult the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program’s streamlined </span><a href="https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Eligible Entity Verification checklist</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does loan forgiveness mean?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to 100% of the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is forgivable if you follow certain requirements around payroll and employee retention. Here’s how it works: If you keep your employees for eight weeks from the time your loan is originated and maintain their salaries (up until June 30, 2020), the SBA will forgive the portion of the loan you used to cover payroll, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities. However, due to the high number of businesses likely to enroll in the program, you need to use at least 75% of the forgiveness amount for payroll. Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels.  Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines, or if salaries and wages decrease</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple caveats, though. For instance, as The Chamber of Commerce’s </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, businesses can’t factor in the salaries of employees who live outside the United States when calculating payroll, nor can they pay any individual employee an annual salary over $100,000. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forgiveness reductions and increases</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you lay off any of your employees within the eight-week time period or cut wages by more than 25% for individual employees who already earn under $100,000 a year, your loan forgiveness amount will be reduced, according to the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, as Neil Bradley, Vice President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce clarified in a </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/events/national-small-business-town-hall-inc-us-chamber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">town hall webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on March 27, there are other factors that may count towards your payroll expenses. For example, if you increased employee wages or compensation during the eight-week period—by covering employee tips, for example—you may be eligible for additional loan forgiveness. Another benefit is that you can bring back any employees you’ve already laid off to be eligible for the loan. You won’t be penalized for re-hiring employees or reinstating their original wages as long as you keep them on payroll for the designated eight weeks.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan payments and logistics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to borrow more money than your forgiveness amount to cover expenses like inventory, you can. As explained by </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/events/national-small-business-town-hall-inc-us-chamber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an FAQ by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the portion of the loan you used for payroll, rent, utilities, and mortgage interest will be considered canceled, and you’ll have to make payments on the remainder of the loan for a term of up to 10 years. Here are other key details according to the </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/events/national-small-business-town-hall-inc-us-chamber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rate is 1%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no prepayment penalties for paying off the loan early.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.finder.com/sba-guarantee-fee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA guarantee fee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—which is usually anywhere from 2-4%—is waived. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loan payments are deferred for six months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no collateral or personal guarantee required.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying for a PPP loan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPP loans are accessible through the SBA or any SBA-approved lender, bank, or credit union. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/paycheck-protection-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundbox can connect you</a> with an easy process to help you get funded quickly.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Injury Disaster Loan and loan grant</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Small Business Administration has <strong><a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-newsroom/press-releases-media-advisories/sbas-economic-injury-disaster-loans-and-advance-program-reopened-all-eligible-small-businesses-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally reopened</a></strong> the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Advance Emergency Grant program. Small business applicants from all industries may now <strong><a href="https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately apply for assistance</a></strong>. The EIDL gives small businesses and private non-profit organizations in the United States and its territories working capital loans up to $2 million. To be eligible your business needs to have fewer than 500 employees, prove that you’ve suffered substantial economic losses as a result of the coronavirus, and be located in a disaster declared county or contiguous county. Businesses with more than 500 employees may still qualify as long as they meet the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA’s size standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you qualify you can use the loan to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other payments you’re struggling with due to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the loan doesn’t offer a forgiveness plan, it’s a flexible and affordable option for small businesses right now. As </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here are the details:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.75%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interest rate for small businesses; 2.75% for non-profit organizations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repayment terms of up to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 years</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No prepayment </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penalties</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal guarantee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required on loans under $200,000</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SBA is also offering small businesses </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIDL advances of up to $10,000 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help offset temporary losses in revenue. Because the advance is considered a grant, </span>you’re not obligated to repay it <span style="font-weight: 400;">if you spend it on paid leave, payroll, increased costs due to supply chain disruption, mortgage or lease payments, or debt obligations you’d otherwise struggle to meet due to revenue losses. What’s more, you can receive the funds within three business days if you’re approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply for the EIDL loan and grant </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by filling out the online forms and providing your credit score. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I apply for both the PPP loan and EIDL? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the guide explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you’re allowed to apply for both the paycheck protection loan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disaster loan. However, you can’t use both loans for the same purpose. If you received an EIDL between January 31, 2020 and the time when the PPP loans are available, you’re still eligible for a PPP loan as long as you didn’t use your EIDL for payroll costs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When can I expect funding?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re approved for the EIDL grant, you can get your $10,000 advance three days after you submit your application. However, funding for the remainder of the loan is determined on a first-come, first-served basis and could take several weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average response time for an SBA loan is 45 to 90 days, but the SBA is working to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drastically shorten that time frame for relief loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, potentially to same-day approval.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deferred employer taxes and payroll tax credits</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the CARES Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your federal employer payroll taxes are now deferred for over a year, which could give your business some cash flow relief. You should pay 50% of your 2020 payments by December 31, 2021 and the other 50% by December 31, 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, you may be eligible for a refundable payroll tax credit equal to 50% of the wages you paid employees from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2020 up to $10,000 per employee. To qualify you need to prove that 1) your operations were either partially or fully stopped due to a mandated coronavirus shutdown or 2) your gross receipts in a certain period declined by 50% or more when compared to the same time period in 2019. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get prepared</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you need immediate financial assistance or not, it’s smart to get prepared. Consult your accountant, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crunch your payroll numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and start gathering financial documents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to consider what might happen if you don’t meet the <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loan forgiveness</a> qualifications. That’s why it’s critical to plan </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure you can afford the cost of the 1% loan if it’s not 100% forgiven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a tough time for business owners right now, but we’re here to support you. To learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protecting your employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and maintaining operations during this stressful time, check out our comprehensive </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-checklist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coronavirus/COVID-19 guide and resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
