Whether your business is well established or at the launch stage, ongoing access to funding is a necessity to create the cash flow and liquidity you need to manage unexpected expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good idea to secure capital from a few different sources to create a funding stream that’s sustainable for the long term. While loans from traditional banking institutions are often among the first that come to mind, they’re far from the only option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a wide world of funding available, including everything from credit cards to angel investors. But these many options can also feel overwhelming, and it’s not always immediately obvious which option is the best fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll provide a rundown of some of the primary options for owners to consider when seeking capital for their new business or enterprise, from the most popular to the unexpected. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-funding, or loans from friends or family </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most obvious source of funding is either a founder’s own savings, or a personal loan from a family member or other close connection. While few have the cash to fund a new business completely, self-funding doesn’t just refer to the cash in an entrepreneur’s personal bank account. It can include other types of assets, such as investments or property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some circumstances, borrowing money from friends and family can be a good option, but this does require caution, as mixing business with personal relationships can be problematic. When borrowing money from a friend or family member, it’s smart to remove as much ambiguity as possible. Mutually agree on terms, then create a written agreement, just as you would with any other loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major advantage of this is that the terms of these loans can be whatever the two parties decide on. For example, the recipient may offer equity in the business in exchange for the funds, or the lender may allow interest-free repayment. The increments in which the loan should be repaid, and the time period to do so, are also up for discussion. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal savings or loans from friends and family are best for businesses that are in the earlier stages of their journey, such as launching or preparing to launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option is also a good fit for businesses with low credit scores, or those that aren’t able to meet the qualifying criteria for a bank loan. In these situations, business owners may see friends and family as their only options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right amount of personal savings and assets to use to fund a business will also depend on the owner’s risk tolerance. How much in the way of liquid assets does the business need to reserve for emergencies and unexpected costs? Calculating </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-does-burn-rate-mean-and-how-is-it-calculated-393196"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burn rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be a good way of determining how much of the owner’s personal savings should be kept easily accessible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There’s no need to go through traditional banks and lenders to access these funds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The repayment terms and schedule are completely up to the recipient and lender.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Self-determined</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of capital comes with much greater freedom than other external funding sources. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mixing business and personal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Borrowing from friends and family has the potential to strain relationships.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Not all businesses have personal cash available, or family and friends who are willing to provide a loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>May drain liquidity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Over-emphasizing cash funding may drain a business’ reserves and leave it vulnerable to unexpected or emergency costs. </span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Line of credit </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-line-of-credit-for-your-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you access to a revolving credit line, which is money you can use on an ongoing basis. Depending on your credit score and the lender, lines of credit can give you access to funds ranging from a few thousand dollars to several hundred thousand dollars.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a revolving line of credit, the recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed, and they can access the approved funds over and over as long as they continue to pay off their draws. The available credit replenishes as the recipient repays. For example, a business uses its entire $10,000 line of credit to pay for inventory, and repays $2,000 of that borrowed amount. It now will have access to the available credit that’s been repaid, that is $2,000, even with $8,000 outstanding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on lines of credit vary widely depending on the lender; they can range from </span><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/rates-on-a-business-line-of-credit-4153312"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 percent to 25 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the applicant’s credit history. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit is best used for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/ebooks/business-line-credit-work-for-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short-term funding needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regular operational expenses. This might include utilities, restocking supplies, ordering inventory for an expected busy season, or covering unexpected costs </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-disaster-prep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during a crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit can also be an effective way to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridge gaps in cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, a business needs to cover payroll by the end of the week, but payments from clients aren’t expected until the end of the month. This is when a line of credit can be used as a temporary solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Business lines of credit are well suited to a variety of purposes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed‌, saving money if they need less cash than originally anticipated.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher credit limit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even if a business doesn’t need the extra cash, knowing it’s available as a safety net in a pinch can give business owners peace of mind. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Variable interest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some lines of credit come with interest rates that fluctuate with the market. This can make it harder for borrowers to budget their payments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Extra fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the recipient misses a payment, they could end up paying a hefty fee. Plus, many lines of credit come with monthly maintenance or draw fees, which can add up over time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank Loans and Term Loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When many people hear “business funding,” bank loans and traditional term loans are one of the first things that come to mind—simply going to the bank to ask for a loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank approves the loan of a fixed sum of money that the business agrees to repay within a set time frame. These loans can be secured against collateral such as the applicant’s home, investment portfolio, or business assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans and term loans can also be unsecured. Typically, unsecured loans will come at a higher cost, either in the form of a higher interest rate or stricter repayment terms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank and term loans are best for established, highly profitable businesses that can meet the strict loan qualifications and prove their ability to repay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newly launched businesses, those that cannot prove profitability, or those without collateral may not be able to satisfy the often strict terms and need to look elsewhere for funding.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Affordable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bank and term loans typically offer lower interest rates than other sources of funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Recipients usually have more time to repay these loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Widely accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are many options available for this kind of funding, through most banks and traditional financial institutions—the hurdle is actually getting approved. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sustainable repayment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Term loans allow you to repay the debt in a steady, predictable way over a moderately long period of time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Strict requirements and a high volume of applicants can make it difficult to qualify for bank and term loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dependent on financial standing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A business needs to have available collateral and be able to prove its profitability before it can be considered for a loan. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed by the SBA, these desirable, but competitive, U.S. government loans are designed specifically for the needs of small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loan programs are drafted in agreement between lenders and the SBA, as the SBA shoulders some of the risks for the lender by guaranteeing a portion of the loan amount. This arrangement benefits both lenders and small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower risk for lenders means they can offer more flexible payment terms and lower interest rates than most small businesses would otherwise be able to secure.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans are highly desirable, which means there is a lot of competition for them and that makes them hard to qualify for. This kind of funding is best for businesses with a good credit history, a clear business plan, and the ability to make a strong case for their profitability.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Designed especially for small businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unlike traditional bank loans, SBA loans target small businesses. The SBA, in partnership with lenders, created guidelines with the aim of aiding small business expansion and growth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Multiple uses for the funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans can be used for a wide range of expenses. According to the SBA, you can use these loans for “most” business purposes, including start-up, expansion, equipment purchases, working capital, inventory, or real estate purchases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Secured loans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans are secured, meaning that the SBA reduces the lender’s risk by guaranteeing a percentage of the loan amount. However, if the business is unable to pay what it owes, the bank can still seize its assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to more lenders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because the federal government guarantees SBA loans, more lenders are willing to offer financing to small businesses through this channel. Many lenders even lower their qualification criteria for small businesses that apply for SBA loans.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Personal credit scores required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In order to qualify for an SBA loan, applicants must have a high personal credit score as well as good business credit. If either score is low, they may not be eligible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that this is also a requirement for the other types of business funding listed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Over two years in business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses must be at least two years old to qualify for an SBA loan. That can be a problem for the over 400,000 new businesses that start up every year in the U.S. and need operational capital to run.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Some restrictions on expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some SBA loan programs have restrictions regarding ‌capital, meaning the money the SBA provides can only be used for specific purposes. The way a business plans to use the funds may have an impact on its loan terms, so applicants should consider their expenses carefully when selecting the appropriate program and before applying for the loan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Specific eligibility requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even though it’s generally easier to get approved for SBA loans than for traditional bank loans, the eligibility criteria can still prove tough for many small businesses. The SBA determines eligibility based on factors such as the nature of the business, where the business operates, and the character of its principals. You can find more details about eligibility requirements for SBA loans on the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official government website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity Investors</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors and venture capital (VC) firms are the two major sources of this type of funding. Angel investors are individuals who invest in companies they believe in, in exchange for equity in and partial ownership of the business. VC firms are larger companies instead of individuals, but like angel investors, they make their money by investing in promising companies for a stake in the business. They both provide valuable expertise, connections, and a wealth of experience to the business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity-based funding sources are best for startups and companies with very high growth potential. They aren’t a typical funding route for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, venture capitalists and angel investors will sometimes invest in businesses with disruptive, unproven business models that may be seen as too high-risk for traditional banks. Businesses that fit those parameters should definitely consider equity investors as part of their funding strategy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Support and mentorship</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When businesses choose equity investors, they get leadership and guidance along with business funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher funding ceiling</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These options come with the potential to secure more funding, ranging from </span><a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-funding-guide/equity-based-financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25,000 – $150,000 for angel investors to much larger amounts for VC firms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Equity investors expect serious returns, so they’re only suitable for businesses planning on dramatic growth trajectories and gaining a very large market share.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sharing control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While the experience and connections may be well worth it, sharing equity does mean giving up some degree of control over the business and how it is run. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Lenders </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses seeking funding aren’t limited to bank, family, or government-backed loans. Online lenders, including peer-to-peer lending platforms, balance sheet lenders, and lender marketplaces, have emerged as a solution to make business funding more easily and widely accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech companies like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are leveraging algorithms, predictive modeling, data aggregation, and electronic payment technology to streamline ‌loan applications and increase the efficiency of the approval process to make funding more accessible for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Fundbox, a business owner can secure flexible funding with a line of credit without needing to collect extensive documentation or undergo a rigorous approval process. This way, a business can access funds at a moment’s notice and take advantage of growth opportunities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders are an excellent option for viable, established businesses that may not yet be able to qualify for a bank loan. They are also a great fit for businesses with a slightly lower credit rating. While credit history is a consideration, online lenders won’t place the same level of emphasis on it that a traditional financial institution would. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ease of access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Online lenders use an application process that is faster, easier, and more streamlined, which is especially good for urgent or unexpected expenses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Less competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of funding can be easier to access than an SBA or bank loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lower barrier to entry</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Collateral is typically not required to be approved for funding from online lenders. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses will still need to be at least somewhat established to qualify. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Must have credit history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The applicant’s business and personal credit history is still a consideration. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wide World of Business Funding</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking business funding can feel overwhelming, but there are enough options out there that whatever your business&#8217; unique structure, needs, and goals, you will be able to find the right funding fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owners now have greater options beyond the obvious choices of bank loans, lines of credit, and credit cards, and can take advantage of multiple funding sources to create a multi-stream, sustainable business funding strategy. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9-768x476.jpeg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="man in construction site" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9-768x476.jpeg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9.jpeg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re a new business owner, everything seems exciting. Your first client, your first dollar, your first day at work are all pivotal moments for your career. Though you may be operating from a single desk in a one-room office, you still imagine the future when your business is booming, employees are bustling, and you have more work than you can handle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many businesses never reach that point. In fact, only about </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive their first year of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve built a strong foundation and emerged from your first few years with a thriving business—congratulations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you’re looking to expand your business and you’re wondering what’s next. First, a word of caution: Expanding your business too soon or too aggressively can be devastating, especially to a construction company. The good news is you can avoid many common pitfalls with some careful planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll walk you through deciding when to expand your construction business, and how to prepare for expansion when you’re ready.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Signs You’re Ready to Expand Your Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you go too far with the process, it’s important to make sure you’re actually ready to expand your construction business. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is expanding before you’re ready. If you scale too soon, you will tap out your resources, potentially leaving yourself cash-strapped and stretched too thin. Here are the most important things to consider before you make the jump:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. You Have Plenty of Work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When businesses consider expansion, it’s usually for one of two reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have more work than their resources can handle, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t have enough work and hope that expanding into new markets will fix this problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, only the first type of businesses survive an expansion. While a new service or territory may be the answer for a small percentage of companies who are lacking sales, it’s rarely the best solution to the problem. In this case, it’s better to reconsider your marketing efforts, customer service, and other potential problems before considering expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your phones are constantly ringing and contracts are coming in quicker than you can count, however, you’re likely ready to grow.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Your Clients Are Happy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, you also want happy customers. If you have plenty of repeat customers or word-of-mouth is your primary marketing strategy, then proceed to the next point. If not, you might evaluate the situation and make sure your current customers are completely satisfied before considering expansion.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. You Have More Money Than Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are checks coming in promptly? Are you meeting payroll without any issues? Are you able to pay yourself a salary? Then you probably don’t have a lot of time on your hands, and that’s okay. In fact, that’s a sure sign that it’s time to consider expanding your business. If nothing else, you need another set of hands to handle some of the tasks, giving yourself room to breathe.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Opportunities for Expansion Arise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe your customers are requesting services that you don’t offer yet. Maybe clients are requesting bids or estimates for jobs outside your current territory. Maybe someone is selling their business, and you’re thinking it would be a great complement to your current services. These are all viable opportunities for expansion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-15850 size-full" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png" alt="" width="1240" height="768" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png 1240w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7-768x476.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step-by-Step Expansion Budgeting Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve decided expansion is the answer, it’s time to start the process. But first, it’s time to make a budget.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Your Plan for Expanding Your Business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of expansions, and it’s important to consider all the different facets of your own plan. Depending on how you plan to expand, you’ll need to focus on different expenses and other considerations. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to acquire another company? If so, you will need to consider real estate closing costs, office and warehouse expenses (including rent and utilities), and additional employee salaries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to add a few more services to your existing business? If that’s the case, your budget may be simpler. You will need to consider things like the materials and labor required to offer those services, as well as any possible overhead expense increases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to bid more jobs? This plan might require more employees. Consider all of the costs associated with those employees, and what they will need to take on more work. You may need to purchase more equipment, more materials, and more tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re thinking, it’s time to get it all down on paper. Start with the overall goal of your expansion, then start listing the steps you will need to take to achieve that goal. Don’t forget small things like acquiring permits and business licenses for new territories, too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimate Your Budget</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimating your budget seems like a huge task, but it’s quite simple when you break it down into smaller steps. You already have the overall plan for your expansion, so now it’s time to dig into the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help getting started, take a blank business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fill in the data using your current financial information. When you’re finished, you should have a strong starting point for a budget that reflects your current financial situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, using your expansion outline created above, fill in another budget template with your projected costs after the expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to do some research to estimate these numbers. For example, if you will need a new office for your expansion, search for available properties in the area to find a good estimate for rent. You may want to work with your bookkeeper or accountant on this planning exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, your goal here is to make sure you remember every possible new expense post-expansion. Common expenses include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee salaries and benefits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land and/or real estate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisition costs if you’re buying another company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials, tools, and equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and advertising</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation and lodging if you’re expanding your service area</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have estimated expenses outlined, you should also </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/formula-for-sales-forecast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimate your future sales.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself a “best case scenario” estimate and a “worst case scenario” estimate. You may want to fill out several different budget sheets to explore different possible outcomes. You can use these numbers to see when your expansion plan will start turning a profit and how much of a profit you can expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, using the range of numbers determined from your budget estimates, you can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research business financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, apply for the financing you need, and finalize the next steps of your expansion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business is seldom easy, but growth is almost inevitable for any strong business model. If you walk through these steps one by one and aren’t afraid of research, you can start your expansion with a strong budget and the funds you need to get the job done quickly. Then you can get back to what you do best: running your business.</span></p>

That’s great news. Now, how should you spend that windfall to deliver maximum benefits for your business? If you need a little help deciding where the money will have the biggest impact, here are 10 ideas to consider.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrade your website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your website fast enough? The probability of users leaving a website increases by 32 percent if the site takes longer than </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-reduce-your-websites-page-speed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 seconds to load</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Is your website easy to use on a mobile device? For several years now, the majority of </span><a href="https://www.perficient.com/insights/research-hub/mobile-vs-desktop-usage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online searches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken place on mobile devices, not on desktop computers. Do you want to start selling online? Your website is your storefront, so hiring a website design company or expert to update and upgrade your site is a smart move.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not ready to hire permanent, full-time employees, outsourcing can be the perfect alternative. Assess which tasks in your business could benefit from outsourcing and look for independent contractors or freelancers to tackle them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donate to charity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your business already have a relationship with a nonprofit organization or charity? Consider sharing the wealth by making a cash donation to your cause. If you’ve always wanted to get involved with a local charity, use your tax refund as the impetus to get started. (Be sure to talk to your accountant about any effects the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">may have on tax consequences of charitable donations.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in business relationships</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is networking an important part of your sales process? Using your tax refund to pay membership dues for an industry association or networking group can reap big benefits. You could also put the money toward membership in a golf club, country club or other leisure organization where you could hobnob with prospective clients off-duty.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start (or add to) your retirement fund</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have a retirement fund, use your tax refund to max out your 2021 contribution. Don’t have a retirement plan yet?  Retirement plan options exist for even the smallest, one-person business. They not only help you prepare for your future, but also give you tax breaks. Learn more about </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p3998.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retirement plans for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your mind</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of business is changing at lightning speed, and you need new skills to keep pace. Use your tax refund to pay for courses at community colleges or online courses like those from </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.skillshare.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skillshare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Udemy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can learn everything from accounting and finance to management and leadership.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in your health</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are the foundation of your business, so taking care of yourself is vital — but if you’re like most entrepreneurs, you don’t have a lot of spare time for self-care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve the problem by spending your refund on a personal trainer to come to your home a few days a week, a meal delivery plan, or another service that saves you time and boosts your energy levels.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reward yourself</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the money to take a much-needed vacation or to treat yourself to a memorable experience. (Experiences create more lasting happiness than things, studies by a </span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.546.6920&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cornell University professor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found.) For example, get tickets to a play, concert or sporting event you normally wouldn’t splurge on.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy or lease new Equipment</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in new machinery, vehicles or other equipment your business needs can have a huge impact on your company’s productivity and sales. Even something as simple as upgrading office equipment like printers and copiers can really streamline your workflow, making your employees more efficient.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a tax professional next year</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was your tax refund really big? As good as it might feel to get that check, it’s not such a great thing: It means you overpaid taxes during the year and let Uncle Sam use your money instead of using it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you did your own business taxes, hold onto part of your tax refund and use it to hire a pro next year. (See our article on the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-common-tax-mistakes-small-business-owners-make/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biggest tax mistakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small business owners make.)</span></p>

In honor of Women’s History Month, we’re highlighting helpful lessons and tips from successful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executives, and entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Identify your purpose</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re running a business, you need to identify your “big why,” said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.christinasjahli.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Sjahli Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that offers virtual CFO services to mission-driven women entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding your clear sense of purpose enables you to focus on what matters most to you and push forward in the challenging moments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already identified your purpose, take some time to reflect. Do you want to build a product that makes people’s lives easier? Do you want to create jobs in your community? Maybe you want to offer a service that helps people achieve a specific goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you figure out what’s fueling you, not only are you less likely to suffer from imposter syndrome, Sjahli said, you’re also able to set better boundaries and goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to find your purpose:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about why you wanted to start a business. What gets you excited? Who is your business for? What are you trying to achieve? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrow your focus and define your mission.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Embrace the opportunity to grow </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned to always take on things I’d never done before. Growth and comfort do not coexist.” – Virginia (Ginni) Rometty, former CEO of IBM</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not be afraid to make decisions. Do not be afraid to make mistakes.” – Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a thriving business, you have to be willing to take risks and embrace challenges. Getting outside your comfort zone can help you gain new skills, solve problems more effectively, and achieve your goals faster. Depending on your business and background, a growth opportunity could be buying the building next door or figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitize your services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to embrace growth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say yes to challenging projects and endeavors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be willing to try new things, whether that means developing a new product or targeting a different customer demographic. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out time and resources for one or two company growth projects a year, like launching a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening a second store. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Be tenacious</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are committed to creating value and if you aren’t afraid of hard times, obstacles become utterly unimportant. A nuisance perhaps, but with no real power. The world respects creation; people will get out of your way.” – Candice Carpenter Olson, former Co-CEO of Fullbridge</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, dealing with setbacks and hardships is inevitable. In order to overcome the obstacles you encounter—including the challenges unique to women, like gender biases and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/score-report-the-financial-state-of-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay inequity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—tenacity is critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe women entrepreneurs must stay resilient and go into each room with confidence like they belong,” said Chynna Morgan, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="http://gifsoutloud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifs Out Loud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that creates experiential marketing campaigns. Picking yourself up takes practice, but it’s the only way to make progress toward your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned early that rejection is protection,” Morgan said, “and everything that I went through with my business happened for a reason.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for staying tenacious: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember your purpose and find motivation there. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think creatively about how to use the resources and tools at your disposal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set boundaries so you have the energy and confidence to continue on during tough times. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Connect with others</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with fellow entrepreneurs and professionals in your field can boost your business, leading to higher revenue and happier customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find one or two organizations that align with your purpose, join them, be an active member, and provide your own insights and values,” Sjahli said. “Over time, they can be your champions and bring in future leads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to team up with other businesses for product launches or mutually beneficial marketing campaigns. “Don’t underestimate the power of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collaborations. They can take your company to the next level,” Morgan said. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips for connecting: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join a professional group in your industry. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give back to an organization related to your mission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/collaborate-community-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to other business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Adopt a learning attitude</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.” – Padmasree Warrior, Founder, President, and CO at Fable</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t succeed in business if you’re not willing to learn. Prioritizing </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-marketing-agency-blogs-follow-inspiration-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts you ahead of the curve. It keeps you humble and adaptable, introduces you to new ideas and perspectives, and helps you stay up to date on industry trends and shifting </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a little bit of effort goes a long way. “Be one percent better every day,” said Sjahli. “Aim high and long-term, but take small steps forward every day.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips to prioritize learning: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get curious about the different aspects of running your business—from product development to customer service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep up with the news in your industry.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask to shadow your employees to learn what they do on a daily basis. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a course or seminar.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for conferences and events in your field. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Ask for help </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. Always be cultivating a support network so that when you stumble—and you will—they’ll be there to catch you.” – </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ladies-get-paid-founder-claire-wasserman-helps-women-entrepreneurs-thrive/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Wasserman</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO and Founder of Ladies Get Paid</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a business isn’t a one-person job. Even if you’re a sole proprietor, it’s still crucial to lean on other people for support and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-best-advice-for-new-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As business owners, sometimes we believe we’re supposed to have all the answers, but the truth is, asking for help is what makes you a great business owner,” Morgan said. “Knowing your strengths and bringing in people to help you with your weaknesses is vital in building a great company.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for asking for help: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask other successful business owners for advice. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smart, capable team members. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource work you don’t have the time or bandwidth to take on. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Invest in financial knowledge</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run a sustainable, profitable business, you have to invest in your own financial knowledge. Understanding your business’s financials is the first step to pricing your offerings correctly, setting realistic revenue goals, planning for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and securing funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth requires you to know your company’s financial health and to have financial visibility of the future,” Sjahli said, “which means you must understand the story behind your balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow.” </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to improve your financial knowledge: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take an active interest in your company’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, revenue, and profit margin.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set goals with financial targets in mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building powerful businesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or a successful business owner, there’s always room to learn and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="474" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Women-Printing-Receipt" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt--768x474.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Printing-Receipt-.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a profit and loss statement? There are many financial statements that your business should maintain and refer to, key among these is your profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement. But why is it so important, what can you learn from it, and how do you calculate P&amp;L? Below are answers to these and other frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What does the profit and loss statement show?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement is an important indicator of your business’ health – across its lifecycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, it can tell you if you’ve reached break-even point. This is the point at which the total cost of goods produced or sold equals the revenue the business makes. Understanding your break-even point can help you price your products, set revenue targets, and identify missing expenses. It’s also a critical part of your business plan. Investors will want to know at what point you stop losing money and begin to turn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement will also show how your business performs over time; breaking down revenue generated, and expenses incurred. With these insights, you can see how profitable your business is and how much cash is left over after your losses are accounted. These funds can be used to grow your business, pay off debt, or contribute to your salary as a business owner. The statement also informs where you may need to cut costs to reduce losses and drive revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you are an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will use your P&amp;L statement to report profits and losses on your individual tax return. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you calculate P&amp;L?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your P&amp;L statement will draw on the following data points and calculations: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Sales (or revenue) &#8211; Cost of Sales (or Cost of Goods Sold) = </span><b>Gross Profit (or Gross Margin)</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross Profit &#8211; Operating Expenses = </span><b>Net Operating Profit</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Operating Profit + Other Income &#8211; Other Expenses = </span><b>Net Profit Before Taxes </b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Profit Before Taxes &#8211; Income Taxes = </span><b>Net Profit (or Loss)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These terms can be confusing. Let’s look at what each means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The net sales your business made during a certain period. This data point should reflect revenue from your primary business activity but also any gains from other activities such as the sale of assets.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The calculation of all the costs involved in manufacturing or selling a product. These typically include materials, transportation, storage, and labor costs. Knowing your cost of goods sold can help you determine how to price your products to maximize profitability and ensure you’re maintaining sustainable margins. It will also help you identify which product lines may be killing your profitability. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gross Profit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can arrive at this number by deducting the cost of sales from your business’ net revenue.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Operating Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Expenses are the costs incurred in the daily running of your business – from rent to marketing, training to vehicle mileage. What’s included in operating expenses? The costs can be variable (the cost of labor, materials, supplies, wages), fixed (rent), and accrued (expenses that are incurred but not yet billed for).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Operating Profit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The profit that remains once you’ve deducted selling and administrative costs or expenses.  </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Other Income and Other Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These buckets account for any income or expenses that aren’t related to your company’s main business operations. For example, other income could include royalties, dividends, or gains from the sale of property or other capital assets. Other expenses refer to the costs associated with unexpected losses like repairs or tax penalties.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Profit Before Taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are your company’s profits before paying income tax. Find it on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about each of these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and why they matter. It’s wise to consult an accountant or bookkeeper if you need help with these calculations.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do you fill out a profit and loss statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many freely available P&amp;L statement templates that you can use. Search online or use one of many Microsoft Office templates. You may need to create separate spreadsheets to calculate each of the data points before entering them in your main P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use accounting software like QuickBooks or FreshBooks you can generate a P&amp;L statement in just a few clicks based on your accounting data. </span></p>
<h3><b>How often should you update your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a goal to update your P&amp;L statement frequently. This may be once a month or once per quarter. If your business is new, your update cycle may be more regular. This allows you to keep an eye on profits and satisfy the needs of investors. Updates will also be prompted by tax season, a new product launch, expansion into a new geography, or the emergence of a new competitor on the block (if your profits are dropping you may need to shift your marketing strategy). </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you interpret your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sense of your P&amp;L statement is even more important than maintaining one. If you’re struggling to understand what the numbers are telling you, have a conversation with an accountant. They can help you understand where revenue is being generated, any pitfalls to profitability, and where costs need to be cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online accounting software can also support your analysis. Charts and graphs help you visualize key information. You can also drill down to get a more detailed view into transactions associated with each graphic. These reports can also be easily shared with an accountant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/financial-indicators-review-accountant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Financial Indicators to Review with Your Accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is the difference between a P&amp;L statement and a balance sheet?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a snapshot of what your business owns (its assets) and what it owes (liabilities).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet won’t inform your profitability or cash flow, however, it is the leading indicator of the overall stability and liquidity of your business and is a useful tool for determining how much cash your business has on hand and your ability to fund growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Do you need to maintain a cash flow statement too?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! It’s critical that you maintain both a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a P&amp;L statement because cash and profitability are two separate indicators. Your cash flow statement provides a detailed picture of where the business’s income comes from and where it goes. If your business shows a profit but maintains a weak cash position, these two statements will give an insight as to why.</span></p>

Small business owners, on the other hand, eagerly await the Saturday in between those days.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows consumers to support small businesses during a time of year when many could benefit from a little extra support. Their deals may not be as flashy as your favorite big-box retailers, but shopping small can have a huge impact on a small business—especially amidst a pandemic.</span></p>
<h2>What is Small Business Saturday?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, during the Great Recession, American Express created a campaign designed to help support the small businesses that are such vital parts of our communities. The campaign created a movement called</span> <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/shop-small/about/?linknav=us-loy-shopsmall-footer-about"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the campaign encouraged consumers to focus on shopping small while checking off their holiday gift list. The cause was celebrated by shoppers and small business owners alike, and 12 years later, the movement is still going strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, small business owners open their shops and drive traffic to their websites by offering deals on both products and services that make great holiday gifts. Some neighborhood small businesses band together to create events surrounding their sales, and others run online promotions so you can shop your favorite small businesses from the comfort of your home.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 40px;">Why Shop Small Business Saturday?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet, you can now shop with small businesses regardless of your location, but one of the main purposes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was to encourage consumers to shop with local businesses. When you shop locally, you help support both small business owners and your greater community as a whole. Your purchases can help create local employment opportunities, bring tax dollars to your neighborhood, and make it possible for those small businesses to give back to the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase from a small business, you help provide job opportunities. For every 10 jobs that exist at a small business, another seven are supported within the same community. Small businesses also generate two out of every three net new jobs, so shopping locally with a small business can have a big impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every dollar spent at a local small business, roughly 67 cents stays within the community. These contributions go past tax dollars, as many small businesses support local events, sports teams, and charities. The ripple effect of shopping at small businesses goes so much farther than many people realize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you shop small, you’re helping a small business owner realize the rewards of their hard work and determination. You may be giving a parent flexibility while raising their children, or you might be supporting a lifelong passion for the business owner. </span></p>
<h2>Why is Small Business Saturday So Important This Year?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While shopping with local businesses is always important, it’s even more critical now, as many small businesses are still struggling to recover from a challenging couple of years due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coronavirus pandemic quickly impacted small businesses. A report from the </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/state-of-small-business-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook &amp; Small Business Roundtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that within the first month of quarantine, approximately one-third of small businesses had temporarily stopped operating, and just one month later, more than half of small businesses were forced to lay off or furlough employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with brick-and-mortar businesses ready and eager to welcome in-person shoppers once again, a strong consumer showing this holiday season could be just the thing local small businesses need to get back on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2021/American-Express-Celebrates-the-12th-Annual-Small-Business-Saturday-Bringing-a-Digitally-Integrated-Holiday-Shopping-Experience-to-Communities-/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express Shop Small Impact survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of small businesses surveyed say this year’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is their most critical one yet. A whopping 78% say their 2021 holiday sales will impact their ability to keep their doors open in 2022. It’s estimated that consumers have the potential to contribute $695B into the U.S. small business economy by shopping small this holiday season, highlighting the tremendous impact shopping small can have on the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take place on November 27, 2021. By shopping small, both on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and on a regular basis, you can help make a difference for small business owners, their employees, and your community. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do you need to figure out how to form your business as a legal entity, you also need to determine how you’re going to market your products and services effectively, who you’re going to hire, and what your ideal customer looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your business starts to grow, more questions come up. When is the right time to expand headcount? When, if ever, is the right time to look for investors or other forms of small business financing, like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? When should you differentiate your product portfolio? When should you move into a new market? When should you rebrand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list goes on and on, and it never ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you’re not the first person to start and grow a successful business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own—and letting the discouragement that comes with things not working out perfectly derail your vision and momentum—why not learn from folks who’ve been in your exact position before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to get some ideas about how to improve your small business, podcasts are the perfect place to find inspiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is our listing of some of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/28-must-hear-podcasts-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best small business podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today and why you might want to start thinking about launching your own podcast at some point in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What podcasts do entrepreneurs listen to?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in checking out some of the best business podcasts, you’ve come to the right place. Without further ado, here are 10 of the best podcasts for entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. The Leslie Samuel Show</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a business that depends on digital? Subscribe to </span><a href="https://iamlesliesamuel.com/bloggingwithleslie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leslie Samuel Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses on how to build resilient online businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie started his career as a high school science and math teacher. He always wanted to teach at the collegiate level, but he didn’t want to get a PhD. So, he created biology videos, posted them on YouTube, and built a devout following—which, ironically, ultimately landed him a professorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward to today, and Leslie’s left the classroom, building an online business to spend more time with his family. The Leslie Samuel Show, which has nearly 400 episodes, can teach you how to do the same. Recent episodes explore how to build sales funnels, how to overcome common entrepreneurial struggles, and how to build a successful digital agency.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Online Marketing Made Easy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Porterfield started out working a 9 to 5 just like most of us. Now, she’s the CEO of a multi-million business. Luckily for you, she shares all of her secrets on her podcast, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/online-marketing-made-easy-with-amy-porterfield/id594703545?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Marketing Made Easy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Amy’s released nearly 400 episodes of the podcast, which gives listeners step-by-step processes they can follow to build incredible online businesses. Tune in to learn more about topics like finding the sweet spot between free and paid content, how to create a high converting sales page, how to re-engage your email list, and whether it makes sense to move to a four-day workweek.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. My Wakeup Call</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Mark Goulston is a psychiatrist, executive coach, and best-selling author.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the name suggests, Dr. Goulston’s podcast highlights instances where people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">woke up </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after an unpleasant experience and improved their lives because of it.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></h3>

She’s the host of </span><a href="https://theintrovertentrepreneur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which—you guessed it—caters to folks who aren’t particularly outgoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoiler alert: Just because you’re not an extrovert doesn’t mean you can’t crush it as an entrepreneur. Don’t believe it? Ask </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/23-amazingly-successful-introverts-throughout-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these famous introverts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Larry Page, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg. </span></p>

Each week, the fine folks over at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">put out a new episode of the show, which features the best and brightest minds in the business world. </span></p>

Recent shows focus on what people like David Bowie and Beyonce can teach us about innovation, why it’s time to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with folks instead of simply networking, and how hybrid work is here to stay—and what that means for businesses like yours.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.  The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Vaynerchuk is a CEO, investor, speaker, and vlogger who’s the host of </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which has an impressive catalog of almost 2,000 episodes to date.

Recent episodes focus on why it’s not worth wasting time for a bigger paycheck, why you should never fake who you are, and achieving the perfect blend of patience and tenacity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How I Built This</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by Guy Raz, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How I Built This</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an engaging podcast that explores the stories behind some of today’s most successful businesses.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Masters of Scale</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid Hoffmann might know a thing or two about how to operate effectively at scale. After all, he co-founded LinkedIn, and he’s currently a partner at Greylock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he’s also the host of the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which explores how businesses scale over 200-plus episodes and counting.

<h2>Fundbox Forward Podcast</h2>
<p>Also, check out our own small business podcast, <a href="https://fundbox.buzzsprout.com/1030801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fundbox Forward</strong></a>, featuring interviews with small business experts and even Fundbox customers who share their insights on small business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I start a business podcast?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, not every business needs a podcast. For example, if you own a local </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">house painting business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food truck operation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your time might be better spent focusing on sales and customer success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, if you’re an expert at what you do and are interested in helping other people follow in your path, a podcast can be a great vehicle to make that happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue the above examples, why not launch a podcast teaching other people how to become expert house painters or food truck owners? You never know when such a podcast might take on a life of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many other kinds of businesses—including marketing agencies, software companies, and even local accounting firms—a podcast might even be a no-brainer. When you record content regularly, you end up with a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library of podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that serves as great marketing content your audience can discover at any time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I start a podcast for my business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite what you might think, starting a podcast doesn’t have to be a massive undertaking. All you need is a name, a theme, a good microphone, and a good script to get started. You’ll also need to determine a show format (e.g., will you interview guests or just tell stories?). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re up for the challenge, you should be able to produce your first episode on your own without too many headaches. A word to the wise: If you take this route, the quality might not be where you wished it were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re really committed to podcasting for your business, you might be best off outsourcing production to a company that specializes in podcasts. Record a show, pass it off to the pros for polishing, and get back to do what you do best: serving your customers to the best of your abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, here’s to discovering podcasts that help you get to the next level in your entrepreneurial journey—and potentially launching your own show to inspire the next generation to do the same.</span></p>

Last summer, during a global pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-07b1c7b4-99d3-43b9-9759-a0c54919bdc2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a record number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans applied for new Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) or tax ID numbers, according to Axios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of startups has slowed some since then, there is still a lot of activity around startup businesses making 2021 an excellent time to start a business. And if you need some help regarding how to start your own business and which businesses you should start in 2021, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<h2>Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, you have a list of small business ideas that appeal to you. The idea is to identify those ideas that can become profitable small businesses. Often, startup entrepreneurs are advised to follow their passion. While that might work in some cases, the truth is just because you are passionate about something doesn’t mean consumers will care. The most successful businesses are the ones that offer products or services that consumers (whether B2B or B2C) want at a price they’re willing to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do consumers want today? Here are a few small business ideas that may be worth pursuing.</span></p>
<h2>B2C Small Business Ideas</h2>
<h3><b>E-commerce</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRF (National Retail Federation) forecasts overall 2021 retail sales to grow between 10.5% to 13.5 %, to between $4.44 trillion-$4.56 trillion. But the more important news is non-store, and</span><a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/retail-sales-now-exceed-444-trillion-2021-nrf-revises-annual-forecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online sales will likely range from $1.09 trillion to $1.13 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an increase of 18% to 23%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Baby products</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The NPD Group, </span><a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/u_s_juvenile_products_industry_grows_6_5_in_2020_reports_the_npd_group/prweb17721091.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents are buying a lot of products</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for their children. NPD says juvenile-products had revenues of $7.35 billion in 2020, up 6.5% in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular categories were:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety products, including health &amp; grooming products and baby gates. 2020 sales hit $587.5 million, up 35% from 2019.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture sales came in at $952.1 million, up 17% from 2019. Top sellers in this category included cribs, toddler beds, and children’s and baby furniture.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entertainment category, including activity seats/jumpers, and swings, rang up $963.6 million in sales.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Toys</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.npd.com/news/press-releases/2021/the-npd-group-u-s-toy-industry-retail-sales-grew-16-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales of toys</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to boom, generating sales of $25.1 billion in 2020, up 16%, according to a report from The NPD Group. Many of these sales took place online, boasting an amazing revenue growth of 75% growth from 2019 to 2020. NPD recommends brick-and-mortar retailers continue to offer BOPIS (buy online, pickup in-store) or curbside pickup options since they provide convenience to busy parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion dolls and accessories (+56%), sports toys, including skates, skateboards, and scooters (+31%), games (+29%), building sets (+26%), and summer seasonal toys (+24%) were top sellers.</span></p>
<h3><b>New online customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/ecommerce-website-builders">open an online store</a>, your target market of customers has significantly grown. Running a business online is an excellent side business idea or home business idea. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports baby boom </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2021/01/21/baby-boombers-online-shopping-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumers over 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are now the fastest-growing category of e-commerce shoppers, joining millions of millennials and Gen Zers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Beauty</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fastest-growing categories in the beauty industry is products targeting male customers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And per a report from CBS News, global research firm Mintel reports </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/male-makeup-is-catching-more-mens-eyes-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds of Gen Z males</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. are interested in gender-free beauty products, and not just products in traditional masculine packaging (dominated by deep red, green and black colors). According to Mintel, “9% of Gen Z males say they use some form of lighter, ‘no-makeup’ makeup, whether it’s tinted moisturizer, BB cream or CC (color correcting) cream.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, in the beauty industry, all the buzz is about clean beauty. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clean beauty market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to grow from revenues of $5.4 billion in 2020 to $11.6 billion in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean beauty means the products are safe and non-toxic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Home improvement</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likely due to the increased number of people working from home, many decided to </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to consumer research giant </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NPD Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020, consumers invested their home improvement dollars in their kitchens and baths (revenues were up 28%), while overall home improvement revenues rose 22%, and paint sales increased 16%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means there are opportunities for businesses that sell these home products. The outlook is also strong for contractors and remodelers. According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, which issues the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) report, forecasts remodeling industry revenues will reach </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$352 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, since many of us will be working from home for the foreseeable future, entrepreneurs selling organizational products or services are in high demand.</span></p>
<h3><b>Food trucks/ghost kitchens</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve always wanted to be in the food business, but the startup costs are too high, consider starting a food truck business or launching a ghost kitchen. Ghost (or virtual) kitchens thrived during the pandemic. They offer take-out and/or food delivery only and often can operate in less costly parts of a city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=3slWLw94I3jq-2B-2FedjFNgZA6lfN8-2Fc97iz7gquTp96XxiM8zX5vuEoiqGxTGsZDA97Aqp-2Bcj6sJYbLXRmu8Nzm8LaOl1TJn1eLtcDYWIioTw-3Dnf5S_dS0-2BUOGLGfm-2FZwhlLNY0jNAYK679fWlON-2B9lmycs5T3BmSbOZokpdb6MQmJSTy3kn2N1cnBHp06IaXmeVL-2B80ti4seJnL9YytXN7-2FgHMfSZJmJLGt-2FrTlRs-2BJBbnGoeZDWAYJd0fn2FXatGGHVLMTZU8fOGicWR3sPO50KgQ0u1ktTkARwGlEiDiFjZ75yEvUwEfvVX-2BBcvLtGpR3Fsbo7jQ21pu8mkK9f4BWauv3zQjFmnItmamZKX1fd7wmwRLTvbfufQvZ8V1sSXnoQ8BvkmFnjJOS-2FqTXVp7OtRxeYhMrf21vyAGnC2J4iG0DDWwC4KOlpt-2FiYpqQQRohCb8oQ-3D-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from industry insider, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">QSR Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said this about quick-service restaurant operators (QSRs): “You can see the appeal. Virtual kitchens are stripped-down commercial cooking spaces with no dine-in option. Functioning as hubs for online delivery and catering orders, they circumvent the need for costly buildouts in premium locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less prime real estate also means more space to accommodate delivery and catering vehicles that would otherwise jockey with customers for parking space.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tutoring</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutors are in great demand today, and starting a tutoring service is a great side business idea. </span><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Private-Tutor-Salary-per-Hour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZipRecruiter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports private tutors are averaging sales of nearly $45,000 a year.</span></p>
<h2>B2B Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All those new startups are going to need help launching and growing their businesses. This means there’s a lot of opportunities for businesses that serve other businesses (B2B). Business services in demand include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountants and bookkeepers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan writers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation services</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual assistant</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Business formation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you decide on what type of business you want to start, you need to take care of the details. Of prime importance is </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choosing the business formation structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s right for you. If you don’t want to incorporate, the simplest and least costly option is to operate as a sole proprietor. If you don’t </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/register-business-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register a separate name for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your state, your first and last name will become, by default, your company’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run a sole proprietorship, there is no legal shield between you and the business. That means you can be personally sued by unhappy clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many business owners are starting an LLC (limited liability companies), which are considered a separate legal entity from its owner/s, which means they’re protected from personal liability for any debts and claims on the business. If you own an LLC, you are required to keep your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-expenses-taxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business’s finances and expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> separate from yours or other members of the LLC.</span></p>
<h2>Which is right for you?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each business structure has its pros, cons, and tax consequences, so before choosing the one that’s best for your company, consult with your accountant and attorney.</span></p>
