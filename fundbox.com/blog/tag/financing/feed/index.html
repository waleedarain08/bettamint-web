										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="477" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="choosing a bank" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, one of your most important partnerships is with your bank. When you’re choosing where to do your small business banking, it’s important to research which institutions will meet your unique needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that many financial services are available online, your list of options is growing, and it can be overwhelming to figure out the best place to start. Many banks offer similar features and services, but not all of them will be the right fit for your business as it grows. Here are a few factors you should keep in mind as you look for the right bank for your small business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your business goals and assess your financial history </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A critical first step is to review </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where your business is now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and where it’s headed. You should choose a bank that can grow with you. You might not need products like a business loan in the next six months, but you may need one as you build on your success and continue to expand your business in a year. For example, you may need accounts that allow you to upgrade to handle more transactions as you take on clients or suppliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for a while, take a look at the last 6 to 12 months of financial history and cash flow patterns. Understanding how you spend and receive money will indicate which banking features you’ll need. Do you need higher limits on your credit card? Will you need access to small business loans? Would a business line of credit help you better manage gaps in cash flow?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your credit score. If your score is low, large national banks may not approve you for all the products you need. You can always sign on with a major bank or credit union and choose online lending options to leverage in tandem when you need access to additional funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you expand your business, you might want to take advantage of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offer affordable financing options to small businesses. Look for institutions that provide SBA-backed loans and resources tailored to small businesses. Also, credit unions and regional or local banks often have programs specifically geared towards small businesses in their area.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware of fees for the features you’ll use the most</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good idea of your business’s financial patterns, you should look for banks with products and services that help you maintain or improve your finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, you need to have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/open-business-bank-account/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business checking account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to house funds and for your everyday transactions. Some banks charge fees if you do not maintain a minimum account balance, but that may not be an issue if you know that you always have extra cash to keep the balance high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you grow your business, you’ll likely need credit cards with higher limits or access to funding options like business loans and lines of credit, which come with their own costs. Additionally, you might need to be able to upgrade your accounts to allow for more transactions throughout the month without incurring extra fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking into extra financing for your business, always look for options that have a low annual percentage rate (APR), which means the institution isn’t charging too many fees on top of your interest payment. Many online financial platforms offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with low or no additional fees. For example, Fundbox does not charge origination fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re looking into ways to save money on your small business banking services, see if you can earn money through the interest rates offered on your desired accounts.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that banking is about building a relationship </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank is part of your business. When you develop a relationship with your bank, they’re likely to see you as less of a risk over time, making it easier to secure financing like loans, lines of credit, and mortgages. It’s easier to build a personal relationship with your bank if you choose a local bank or credit union, especially those that are invested in supporting small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller banks may also have advisory services and resources specifically geared towards small business owners. Developing a personal relationship with your banker or advisor means that they get to know your business and can suggest the best products to help you grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for banks that have experience in your industry and understand your business. Many national banks have specialized industry bankers who know the challenges that your particular business might face and can recommend more personalized solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s helpful to choose a bank that has a physical branch where you can meet with a banker or advisor in person, particularly when you need to resolve issues or when you’re looking for advice about the products they offer. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about convenience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you’re likely wearing many hats and juggling several aspects of your operations every day. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best banks for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it as easy as possible to manage your finances when it’s convenient for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online options enable you to handle your everyday banking from anywhere, at any time. However, if you run a brick-and-mortar business, choose a bank with a physical branch that’s close to your location, making it easy to complete regular cash deposits. Ensure that the bank’s hours fit around your business hours so you can spend your time focusing on your customers during that time, rather than standing in line at the bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you travel nationally for your business, you’ll want to select small business banking options that are available across every state, or institutions with low fees for using other banks’ ATMs and services. This is also a major consideration if you travel internationally. Narrow down the options that offer you optimal support and access to your money everywhere you do business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you should choose a bank with the right balance of online accessibility, convenient branch locations, and overall exceptional customer service. Think of your bank as an extension of your business, like a supplier or retailer. The best bank for you is the one that will help you through every stage of your business journey. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investing in quality equipment or other business upgrades can be critical to boosting productivity and operational efficiency, and ultimately to the ongoing success and growth of a business. However, while these upgrades are beneficial for small businesses, the associated costs are often prohibitive, requiring substantial upfront investment. Term loans can help by providing the funds necessary to make an outright purchase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When growing your business is a priority, having the right equipment is key. So how can small businesses access the funding needed for equipment upgrades, renovations, or expansion? If the cost of upgrading your business presents a challenge to your cash flow, depending on the specific needs of your business an equipment or term loan may be the answer.</span></p>
<h2>What is equipment financing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly </span><a href="https://www.elfaonline.org/about/industry-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight in ten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. companies (79 percent) use some form of financing when acquiring equipment, including loans, leases, and lines of credit (but excluding credit cards). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, equipment financing is funding that enables businesses to purchase the equipment required for business operations and growth. By providing the funds needed to purchase equipment, this type of lending can help free up working capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you have multiple viable options you can explore to obtain financing for equipment and for other growth initiatives. Determining the right one depends on the needs of your business and many other factors. Consider the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximate loan amount needed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business revenue</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repayment terms </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit scores (personal and business)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projected return on investment (ROI) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let&#8217;s take a look at some of the financing avenues available: </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans are a great option for small business owners in need of quick access to cash to upgrade their businesses. Here’s why: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans provide you with a lump sum upfront, which you’ll repay, along with interest and fees, over a fixed period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can range from short-term loans with repayment periods of one year or less, to longer-term loans with repayment periods up to 10 years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll enjoy greater flexibility in the ways you can use the funds from a term loan in comparison to equipment-only loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans enable businesses short on cash flow to invest in equipment, but also the opportunity to maximize revenue growth. For example, you could use the funds from a term loan to extend operations, buy equipment, or finance new marketing or advertising initiatives. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional advantage of using a term loan to fund large equipment investments is that equipment owned by the business can be claimed on the business’s tax return as a depreciating asset. Depreciation measures the value of an asset over time as it ages from wear and tear. Business equipment qualifies for the write-off if it is used to generate income, and if its lifespan is expected to be more than one year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name implies, equipment loans exist for a single purpose: to finance your equipment. The equipment itself acts as collateral and when you&#8217;re done making payments, you will own the equipment. Until then, if you default on the loan, the lender can take back the equipment to help recoup their costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment is typically quite expensive and outright investment can quickly drain a business’s bank account. By providing the funds needed to purchase equipment, this type of lending can help improve a business’s working capital for other expenses.  Equipment lenders are usually more flexible when it comes to credit scores and financial history so it may be quicker and easier to qualify for an equipment loan — especially since the equipment you are purchasing is often used as collateral to secure the loan. On the other hand, more traditional lenders like a bank or credit union typically require higher credit scores, extensive financial history, and other documentation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as with any other form of financing, there are also a few potential drawbacks to equipment loans. These include restrictive usage terms, high down payment requirements, maintenance liability, and depreciation risk. Unlike other types of loans, which offer more flexibility in how you can make use of the borrowed funds, equipment loans are limited to equipment purchases.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment leasing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to leasing versus buying a car, rather than buying your equipment, you also have the option to lease it for a set period of time. In this scenario, the lender owns the equipment, and you are simply paying to use it. Unlike equipment financing, equipment leases generally do not require down payments or collateral and may have lower monthly installments than an equipment loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leasing is also a good option for you if you plan to buy the equipment but need more flexible payment terms, or if you think you will need to replace the equipment at the end of the lease. However, depending on the purchase payment terms at the end, leasing could end up costing you more in the long run. Additionally, when you own a piece of equipment, you can take advantage of </span><a href="https://www.section179.org/section_179_deduction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 179 depreciation tax benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it will be yours to sell if you decide you no longer need or want it in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different avenues to obtaining equipment financing for business upgrades, expansion, and equipment purchases. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the best one depends on the unique needs of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just as you would when making any large purchase, you can make sure you’re getting the best possible financing deal for your business by thoroughly comparing terms between lenders before making any commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you a small business owner in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Whether you’re trying to expand or looking to buy equipment and inventory, a business term loan may be the solution you need. The loan can be used to invest in the growth of your business, and then the returns can help you to repay the loan and interest over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure where to start? The good news is you don’t have to step into a bank or even leave your desk chair to shop for term loans for your business. Online lenders can make it easy and convenient to apply from your smartphone or computer, and Fundbox may be able to help. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and find out in minutes if you are approved and get funding as soon as the next business day.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12-768x476.jpeg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="man packing warehouse" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12-768x476.jpeg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_12.jpeg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many business owners, funding is the most challenging part of running a business. Whether your business is well established or at the launch stage, ongoing access to funding is a necessity to create the cash flow and liquidity you need to manage unexpected expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good idea to secure capital from a few different sources to create a funding stream that’s sustainable for the long term. While loans from traditional banking institutions are often among the first that come to mind, they’re far from the only option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a wide world of funding available, including everything from credit cards to angel investors. But these many options can also feel overwhelming, and it’s not always immediately obvious which option is the best fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll provide a rundown of some of the primary options for owners to consider when seeking capital for their new business or enterprise, from the most popular to the unexpected. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-funding, or loans from friends or family </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most obvious source of funding is either a founder’s own savings, or a personal loan from a family member or other close connection. While few have the cash to fund a new business completely, self-funding doesn’t just refer to the cash in an entrepreneur’s personal bank account. It can include other types of assets, such as investments or property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some circumstances, borrowing money from friends and family can be a good option, but this does require caution, as mixing business with personal relationships can be problematic. When borrowing money from a friend or family member, it’s smart to remove as much ambiguity as possible. Mutually agree on terms, then create a written agreement, just as you would with any other loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major advantage of this is that the terms of these loans can be whatever the two parties decide on. For example, the recipient may offer equity in the business in exchange for the funds, or the lender may allow interest-free repayment. The increments in which the loan should be repaid, and the time period to do so, are also up for discussion. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal savings or loans from friends and family are best for businesses that are in the earlier stages of their journey, such as launching or preparing to launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option is also a good fit for businesses with low credit scores, or those that aren’t able to meet the qualifying criteria for a bank loan. In these situations, business owners may see friends and family as their only options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right amount of personal savings and assets to use to fund a business will also depend on the owner’s risk tolerance. How much in the way of liquid assets does the business need to reserve for emergencies and unexpected costs? Calculating </span><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-does-burn-rate-mean-and-how-is-it-calculated-393196"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burn rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be a good way of determining how much of the owner’s personal savings should be kept easily accessible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There’s no need to go through traditional banks and lenders to access these funds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The repayment terms and schedule are completely up to the recipient and lender.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Self-determined</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of capital comes with much greater freedom than other external funding sources. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Mixing business and personal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Borrowing from friends and family has the potential to strain relationships.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Not all businesses have personal cash available, or family and friends who are willing to provide a loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>May drain liquidity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Over-emphasizing cash funding may drain a business’ reserves and leave it vulnerable to unexpected or emergency costs. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Line of credit </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-line-of-credit-for-your-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you access to a revolving credit line, which is money you can use on an ongoing basis. Depending on your credit score and the lender, lines of credit can give you access to funds ranging from a few thousand dollars to several hundred thousand dollars.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a revolving line of credit, the recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed, and they can access the approved funds over and over as long as they continue to pay off their draws. The available credit replenishes as the recipient repays. For example, a business uses its entire $10,000 line of credit to pay for inventory, and repays $2,000 of that borrowed amount. It now will have access to the available credit that’s been repaid, that is $2,000, even with $8,000 outstanding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates on lines of credit vary widely depending on the lender; they can range from </span><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/rates-on-a-business-line-of-credit-4153312"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 percent to 25 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on the applicant’s credit history. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit is best used for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/ebooks/business-line-credit-work-for-you/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short-term funding needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and regular operational expenses. This might include utilities, restocking supplies, ordering inventory for an expected busy season, or covering unexpected costs </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-disaster-prep/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">during a crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A line of credit can also be an effective way to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridge gaps in cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, a business needs to cover payroll by the end of the week, but payments from clients aren’t expected until the end of the month. This is when a line of credit can be used as a temporary solution.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Business lines of credit are well suited to a variety of purposes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The recipient only pays interest on the money borrowed‌, saving money if they need less cash than originally anticipated.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher credit limit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even if a business doesn’t need the extra cash, knowing it’s available as a safety net in a pinch can give business owners peace of mind. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Variable interest rates</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some lines of credit come with interest rates that fluctuate with the market. This can make it harder for borrowers to budget their payments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Extra fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If the recipient misses a payment, they could end up paying a hefty fee. Plus, many lines of credit come with monthly maintenance or draw fees, which can add up over time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank Loans and Term Loans</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When many people hear “business funding,” bank loans and traditional term loans are one of the first things that come to mind—simply going to the bank to ask for a loan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank approves the loan of a fixed sum of money that the business agrees to repay within a set time frame. These loans can be secured against collateral such as the applicant’s home, investment portfolio, or business assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank loans and term loans can also be unsecured. Typically, unsecured loans will come at a higher cost, either in the form of a higher interest rate or stricter repayment terms. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank and term loans are best for established, highly profitable businesses that can meet the strict loan qualifications and prove their ability to repay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newly launched businesses, those that cannot prove profitability, or those without collateral may not be able to satisfy the often strict terms and need to look elsewhere for funding.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Affordable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bank and term loans typically offer lower interest rates than other sources of funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Recipients usually have more time to repay these loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Widely accessible</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There are many options available for this kind of funding, through most banks and traditional financial institutions—the hurdle is actually getting approved. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sustainable repayment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Term loans allow you to repay the debt in a steady, predictable way over a moderately long period of time. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Strict requirements and a high volume of applicants can make it difficult to qualify for bank and term loans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dependent on financial standing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A business needs to have available collateral and be able to prove its profitability before it can be considered for a loan. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed by the SBA, these desirable, but competitive, U.S. government loans are designed specifically for the needs of small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loan programs are drafted in agreement between lenders and the SBA, as the SBA shoulders some of the risks for the lender by guaranteeing a portion of the loan amount. This arrangement benefits both lenders and small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower risk for lenders means they can offer more flexible payment terms and lower interest rates than most small businesses would otherwise be able to secure.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA loans are highly desirable, which means there is a lot of competition for them and that makes them hard to qualify for. This kind of funding is best for businesses with a good credit history, a clear business plan, and the ability to make a strong case for their profitability.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Designed especially for small businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unlike traditional bank loans, SBA loans target small businesses. The SBA, in partnership with lenders, created guidelines with the aim of aiding small business expansion and growth. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Multiple uses for the funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans can be used for a wide range of expenses. According to the SBA, you can use these loans for “most” business purposes, including start-up, expansion, equipment purchases, working capital, inventory, or real estate purchases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Secured loans</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: SBA loans are secured, meaning that the SBA reduces the lender’s risk by guaranteeing a percentage of the loan amount. However, if the business is unable to pay what it owes, the bank can still seize its assets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Access to more lenders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because the federal government guarantees SBA loans, more lenders are willing to offer financing to small businesses through this channel. Many lenders even lower their qualification criteria for small businesses that apply for SBA loans.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Personal credit scores required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In order to qualify for an SBA loan, applicants must have a high personal credit score as well as good business credit. If either score is low, they may not be eligible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that this is also a requirement for the other types of business funding listed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Over two years in business</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses must be at least two years old to qualify for an SBA loan. That can be a problem for the over 400,000 new businesses that start up every year in the U.S. and need operational capital to run.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Some restrictions on expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Some SBA loan programs have restrictions regarding ‌capital, meaning the money the SBA provides can only be used for specific purposes. The way a business plans to use the funds may have an impact on its loan terms, so applicants should consider their expenses carefully when selecting the appropriate program and before applying for the loan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Specific eligibility requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even though it’s generally easier to get approved for SBA loans than for traditional bank loans, the eligibility criteria can still prove tough for many small businesses. The SBA determines eligibility based on factors such as the nature of the business, where the business operates, and the character of its principals. You can find more details about eligibility requirements for SBA loans on the </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official government website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity Investors</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors and venture capital (VC) firms are the two major sources of this type of funding. Angel investors are individuals who invest in companies they believe in, in exchange for equity in and partial ownership of the business. VC firms are larger companies instead of individuals, but like angel investors, they make their money by investing in promising companies for a stake in the business. They both provide valuable expertise, connections, and a wealth of experience to the business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity-based funding sources are best for startups and companies with very high growth potential. They aren’t a typical funding route for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, venture capitalists and angel investors will sometimes invest in businesses with disruptive, unproven business models that may be seen as too high-risk for traditional banks. Businesses that fit those parameters should definitely consider equity investors as part of their funding strategy. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Support and mentorship</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When businesses choose equity investors, they get leadership and guidance along with business funding. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher funding ceiling</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These options come with the potential to secure more funding, ranging from </span><a href="https://www.guidantfinancial.com/small-business-funding-guide/equity-based-financing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$25,000 – $150,000 for angel investors to much larger amounts for VC firms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Equity investors expect serious returns, so they’re only suitable for businesses planning on dramatic growth trajectories and gaining a very large market share.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sharing control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While the experience and connections may be well worth it, sharing equity does mean giving up some degree of control over the business and how it is run. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Lenders </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses seeking funding aren’t limited to bank, family, or government-backed loans. Online lenders, including peer-to-peer lending platforms, balance sheet lenders, and lender marketplaces, have emerged as a solution to make business funding more easily and widely accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech companies like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are leveraging algorithms, predictive modeling, data aggregation, and electronic payment technology to streamline ‌loan applications and increase the efficiency of the approval process to make funding more accessible for small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Fundbox, a business owner can secure flexible funding with a line of credit without needing to collect extensive documentation or undergo a rigorous approval process. This way, a business can access funds at a moment’s notice and take advantage of growth opportunities.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it right for your business? </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online lenders are an excellent option for viable, established businesses that may not yet be able to qualify for a bank loan. They are also a great fit for businesses with a slightly lower credit rating. While credit history is a consideration, online lenders won’t place the same level of emphasis on it that a traditional financial institution would. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pros: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ease of access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Online lenders use an application process that is faster, easier, and more streamlined, which is especially good for urgent or unexpected expenses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Less competitive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This kind of funding can be easier to access than an SBA or bank loan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lower barrier to entry</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Collateral is typically not required to be approved for funding from online lenders. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cons:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Not universally available</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Businesses will still need to be at least somewhat established to qualify. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Must have credit history</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The applicant’s business and personal credit history is still a consideration. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wide World of Business Funding</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking business funding can feel overwhelming, but there are enough options out there that whatever your business&#8217; unique structure, needs, and goals, you will be able to find the right funding fit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business owners now have greater options beyond the obvious choices of bank loans, lines of credit, and credit cards, and can take advantage of multiple funding sources to create a multi-stream, sustainable business funding strategy. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="476" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9-768x476.jpeg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="man in construction site" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9-768x476.jpeg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/blog_9.jpeg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re a new business owner, everything seems exciting. Your first client, your first dollar, your first day at work are all pivotal moments for your career. Though you may be operating from a single desk in a one-room office, you still imagine the future when your business is booming, employees are bustling, and you have more work than you can handle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many businesses never reach that point. In fact, only about </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/advocacy/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive their first year of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve built a strong foundation and emerged from your first few years with a thriving business—congratulations!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you’re looking to expand your business and you’re wondering what’s next. First, a word of caution: Expanding your business too soon or too aggressively can be devastating, especially to a construction company. The good news is you can avoid many common pitfalls with some careful planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll walk you through deciding when to expand your construction business, and how to prepare for expansion when you’re ready.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Signs You’re Ready to Expand Your Business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you go too far with the process, it’s important to make sure you’re actually ready to expand your construction business. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is expanding before you’re ready. If you scale too soon, you will tap out your resources, potentially leaving yourself cash-strapped and stretched too thin. Here are the most important things to consider before you make the jump:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. You Have Plenty of Work</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When businesses consider expansion, it’s usually for one of two reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have more work than their resources can handle, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t have enough work and hope that expanding into new markets will fix this problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, only the first type of businesses survive an expansion. While a new service or territory may be the answer for a small percentage of companies who are lacking sales, it’s rarely the best solution to the problem. In this case, it’s better to reconsider your marketing efforts, customer service, and other potential problems before considering expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your phones are constantly ringing and contracts are coming in quicker than you can count, however, you’re likely ready to grow.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Your Clients Are Happy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, you also want happy customers. If you have plenty of repeat customers or word-of-mouth is your primary marketing strategy, then proceed to the next point. If not, you might evaluate the situation and make sure your current customers are completely satisfied before considering expansion.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. You Have More Money Than Time</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are checks coming in promptly? Are you meeting payroll without any issues? Are you able to pay yourself a salary? Then you probably don’t have a lot of time on your hands, and that’s okay. In fact, that’s a sure sign that it’s time to consider expanding your business. If nothing else, you need another set of hands to handle some of the tasks, giving yourself room to breathe.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Opportunities for Expansion Arise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe your customers are requesting services that you don’t offer yet. Maybe clients are requesting bids or estimates for jobs outside your current territory. Maybe someone is selling their business, and you’re thinking it would be a great complement to your current services. These are all viable opportunities for expansion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-15850 size-full" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png" alt="" width="1240" height="768" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7.png 1240w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blog_7-768x476.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step-by-Step Expansion Budgeting Process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve decided expansion is the answer, it’s time to start the process. But first, it’s time to make a budget.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Your Plan for Expanding Your Business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of expansions, and it’s important to consider all the different facets of your own plan. Depending on how you plan to expand, you’ll need to focus on different expenses and other considerations. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to acquire another company? If so, you will need to consider real estate closing costs, office and warehouse expenses (including rent and utilities), and additional employee salaries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to add a few more services to your existing business? If that’s the case, your budget may be simpler. You will need to consider things like the materials and labor required to offer those services, as well as any possible overhead expense increases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you planning to bid more jobs? This plan might require more employees. Consider all of the costs associated with those employees, and what they will need to take on more work. You may need to purchase more equipment, more materials, and more tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re thinking, it’s time to get it all down on paper. Start with the overall goal of your expansion, then start listing the steps you will need to take to achieve that goal. Don’t forget small things like acquiring permits and business licenses for new territories, too.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimate Your Budget</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimating your budget seems like a huge task, but it’s quite simple when you break it down into smaller steps. You already have the overall plan for your expansion, so now it’s time to dig into the numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help getting started, take a blank business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget template</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fill in the data using your current financial information. When you’re finished, you should have a strong starting point for a budget that reflects your current financial situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, using your expansion outline created above, fill in another budget template with your projected costs after the expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to do some research to estimate these numbers. For example, if you will need a new office for your expansion, search for available properties in the area to find a good estimate for rent. You may want to work with your bookkeeper or accountant on this planning exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, your goal here is to make sure you remember every possible new expense post-expansion. Common expenses include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee salaries and benefits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land and/or real estate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquisition costs if you’re buying another company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials, tools, and equipment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing and advertising</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation and lodging if you’re expanding your service area</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have estimated expenses outlined, you should also </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/formula-for-sales-forecast"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimate your future sales.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself a “best case scenario” estimate and a “worst case scenario” estimate. You may want to fill out several different budget sheets to explore different possible outcomes. You can use these numbers to see when your expansion plan will start turning a profit and how much of a profit you can expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, using the range of numbers determined from your budget estimates, you can </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research business financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, apply for the financing you need, and finalize the next steps of your expansion.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business is seldom easy, but growth is almost inevitable for any strong business model. If you walk through these steps one by one and aren’t afraid of research, you can start your expansion with a strong budget and the funds you need to get the job done quickly. Then you can get back to what you do best: running your business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There comes a time in the life of every small business when cash gets a little tight and decision makers look for outside sources of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these instances, many small business owners will hop on the chance to secure a loan. But not everyone looks forward to the process and time it takes to get approved for a traditional business loan—and that’s assuming you can get approved in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small business owners who seek timely financing to invest in their business and cover their operating expenses, invoice financing may be a much more sensible funding option.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between invoice financing and invoice factoring?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms “invoice financing” and “invoice factoring” are often used synonymously, though they’re not the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn about the differences between invoice factoring and invoice financing to see which one makes the most sense for your business.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is invoice factoring?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invoice factoring typically requires small businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to a third party at a hefty discount. Believe it or not, factoring companies have been known to take as much as 40 percent of the value of an invoice as their fee. More commonly, however, factors charge 10 to 15 percent on each invoice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, a factoring company will give you a slice of your unpaid invoice up front. Then they’ll repay the remainder of the invoice, minus their fee, when they collect payment from your customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a key consideration here. When you decide to move forward with invoice factoring, your customers end up paying the factoring company, not your business. This can be slightly embarrassing to say the least. Making matters worse, this also opens the door to the possibility that your customer will have a negative experience dealing with the factor you decide to join forces with, which could hurt your chances at doing business with the customer again in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, some factoring companies might decide </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to buy your unpaid invoices if your clients have bad reputations or suboptimal credit scores. In order to move forward with invoice factoring, you need to be able to prove that your clients are good for their money and are generating consistent revenue on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth pointing out that invoice factoring companies are known to charge any number of additional fees—including origination and account setup fees, lockbox or service fees, incremental fees, unused line fees, monthly minimum volume fees, renewal fees, overdue or collection fees, credit check fees, non-recourse factoring fees, ACH transaction fees, and wire fees, among a myriad of other fees. These fees may not be disclosed clearly upfront and may require some digging to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add it all up, and it’s safe to say that you need to research your options and read the fine print before moving forward with invoice factoring. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does invoice financing work for a company?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonly mistaken as </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-invoice-factoring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice factoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, invoice financing allows you to borrow against your uncollected receivables. Instead of letting unpaid invoices collect dust and hinder your business, you can use an invoice financing service to advance payments on outstanding invoices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, it operates like an on-demand business cash advance against unpaid invoices. When you advance cash for unpaid invoices, you usually repay the advance, plus a small fee, within a certain time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With invoice financing, small businesses can get a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revolving credit line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against unpaid invoices without affecting their relationships with their clients. Rather than selling unpaid invoices to a factoring company and incurring the associated discount—and dealing with all the potential associated problems—invoice financing enables you to retain control over all of your invoices, only borrowing against the ones you choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being the case, invoice financing allows small business owners to reclaim control of their cash flow. Instead of scrambling to put together money to pay bills each month, they get the peace of mind that comes with knowing funds are only just a click of the mouse or tap of the finger away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to helping small business owners pay regular operating expenses, invoice financing services can also give companies enough padding to develop new products; launch new marketing initiatives; buy new equipment and technology; open additional locations; and remodel their storefronts, restaurants, and offices, among other things.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is invoice financing a good idea?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it really boils down to it, it’s impossible to say whether invoice financing is a good idea for your business or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company’s financial circumstances are unique, and different financing options will make more sense than others based on specific situations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, invoice financing tends to be a more affordable option than invoice factoring. It also gives you more control over your company’s image, since you can give your customers more time to pay instead of having to ask for payment immediately. And you’ll also end up collecting money directly from them whenever they settle their accounts instead of having a third party ask for money on your behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the invoice financing solution you choose, you should also be able to get paid much sooner than you would by using a factoring service. Due to a longer application process and the due diligence the factoring company needs to do, it tends to take a week or more to receive funds through factoring. On the flip side, you may be able to get paid within two or three days using invoice financing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much does invoice financing cost?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any other financial instrument, invoice financing fees vary. Generally speaking, however, this is one of the more affordable forms of small business financing because you’re borrowing against what you’re already owed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you settle on invoice factoring or invoice financing, it’s worth exploring your other options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you may be able to overcome cash gaps simply by changing the way you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/when-should-you-send-your-invoices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invoice your customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re waiting until the end of the month to send your clients a bill, consider testing out whether it makes sense to invoice them once work is complete. This could accelerate payment timelines considerably.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatives to invoice financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in securing fast, flexible financing quickly, you may also want to consider applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If approved, you can borrow against your line of credit and only pay interest on the money you’ve taken out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Fundbox account is fast and simple. There is no long approval process or piles of paperwork to fill out. To start, just provide some basic business details. Next, connect business accounts like your bank account and accounting software, such as QuickBooks Online or FreshBooks. If approved, you’ll see your available credit in your Fundbox dashboard. Select an amount to draw, and the funds will be in your bank account as soon as the next business day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn all about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox short term financing rate</span></a> <a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can choose your repayment terms—either 12 or 24 weeks. You’ll always see your repayment total before you draw funds. If you repay early, there are no prepayment penalties.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="475" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver-768x475.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="women truck driver" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver-768x475.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver.jpg 1142w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That old adage, “You need to spend money to make money,” applies directly to leveraging equipment financing for your small business. Whether you’re a restaurateur who needs to outfit a kitchen with commercial appliances and tools, a nail technician looking for salon chairs, or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-get-equipment-financing-for-your-construction-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction startup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring heavy machinery, fronting the cost of the equipment you need to operate your business — before you have revenue — is a challenge for every entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are many </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding options </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet this challenge, including commercial equipment loans, general small business loans, and credit. Traditional lenders like banks may be a good choice if you have been in business for more than two years, but for younger businesses, equipment financing companies provide opportunities to acquire the equipment you need, even if you do not  have credit history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New equipment can help you optimize and expand your operations. Equipment also helps you earn more revenue, which, in turn, can help you pay down the balance of your equipment loan. In short, equipment financing is the type of debt that allows you to acquire a revenue-generating asset — a strategic decision that can strengthen your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is equipment financing? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing is funding specifically designed for purchases of equipment you’ll use to operate your business. This can include anything from laptops and office furniture to vehicles and construction or farming machinery. If you do not have the working capital available to purchase more expensive types of equipment, financing can help front the cost so you can start growing your operations. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many lenders use the equipment itself as collateral. If you default on the loan, the lender will repossess the equipment to cover the loss. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you leverage equipment loans to buy the equipment you need outright, you may be able to claim the full price of the equipment as a deduction on your taxes under </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-179.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 179 of the IRS tax code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Equipment leasing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another equipment financing option to consider is leasing, an agreement that’s similar to leasing a car, where you essentially rent the equipment you need and pay the lease provider in monthly installments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some benefits of leasing include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You typically do not have to provide a down payment or collateral.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be able to qualify for a lease even if you have a low credit score. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to renew your lease agreement when the term ends, continuing with both monthly payments and use of the equipment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lease-to-own programs allow you to take possession of the equipment once the initial lease is paid off. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the downsides of leasing is that your equipment will not be considered a fixed asset on your financial statements and will not count towards your business’s net worth. However, </span><a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/tax-implications-of-leasing-business-equipment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be able to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim lease payments as a rent expense on your taxes. </span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need to qualify for equipment financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new business owners, the ability to secure financing through traditional lenders can be a challenge, as most of these lenders are reluctant to take a risk on a business with no credit or established sales history. Many lenders will check your personal credit history if your business doesn’t yet have a credit history. You may also be required to provide a personal guarantee, which means that you’re responsible for repaying the debt with your own money or assets.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for equipment loans, most lenders will require you to provide information about how the equipment will help you run your business or increase profitability. Therefore, at the outset, it’s a good idea to understand how the equipment will deliver a return on investment and to have a thorough plan that outlines how you will use the loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also need to know how much funding you actually need. Some lenders can offer up to $5 million, while others cap funding at $100,000 or less. Be aware that if you secure a loan for more than you’ll use, you’ll likely be charged a prepayment fee if you want to pay the remainder of the balance off earlier than the agreed-upon time frame — similar to a mortgage. Finally, it’s important to understand what type of repayment terms will work best for your business, as loan payments will affect your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re just starting out, it can seem like you need to buy everything you imagine you’ll need right away. Determining which pieces of equipment are essential can help you invest in purchases that will have the biggest impact. You can always combine loans for high-priority equipment with leasing for low-priority equipment to avoid sinking money into items you might not end up using. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing options </span></h2>
<h3><b>Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for Brand New Businesses or Growing Businesses</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-2-sba-504-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 504 loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $5 million (with repayment terms up to 25 years) are available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and can be used for heavy equipment you plan to use long-term. Here are some of the key requirements for a 504 loan that you should be aware of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a tangible net worth of less than $15 million and have made under $5 million in the last two years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have proof that you haven’t been able to secure funding from another source.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must provide a personal guarantee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equipment itself must be used as collateral. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3 percent fee will be tacked onto the value of the loan plus the interest rate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-1-sba-7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 7(a) loans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are also a popular choice for small business financing. However, some key differences make this a less desirable option: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7(a) loan has a variable interest rate, while the 504 offers a fixed rate, at an increment above the current market rate for 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury issues.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7(a) loan may require a larger down payment, up to 30 percent of the loan, while only 10 percent is required for a 504 loan. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses will find it easier to gain approval for an SBA loan. However, the loan application process can take up to eight weeks, which is something to consider if you need the funds quickly. </span></p>
<h3><b>Term loans from banks</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Option for Mature Businesses</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans are a good option if you’ve been in business for a while, but they are not the best option for new businesses. To qualify for this type of loan, you need to have proven, consistent revenue and a good credit score. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/smallbusiness/business-financing/business-equipment-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires you to have been in business for at least two years and have a minimum of $250,000 in annual revenue. One of the benefits of term loans is that they don’t necessarily need to be used for commercial equipment or machinery; you can use them to pay for anything your business needs. </span></p>
<h3><b>Credit</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for Brand New Businesses </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business lines of credit and business credit cards are alternatives to equipment loans that enable you to access funds quickly. The benefit of these sources of funding is that once you’ve paid down a portion of the balance, you can use those funds as working capital in your business again. The downside is that they might not be able to provide the amount of funding you need to make larger purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another downside is interest rates. Lines of credit often have higher interest rates than loans. Business credit cards have interest rates that are higher still (up to </span><a href="https://www.creditcardsexplained.com/cards-for/business?sid=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioIkt6wM9DjIhv2xMss5Vgxoa9GnnRWNxF1kdL2IPkeiCPkklUuzyukaAtXZEALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 percent APR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and often have fees associated with them. Additionally, some equipment vendors do not take credit cards as a form of payment. </span></p>
<h3><b>Loans from equipment financing companies</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for New Businesses </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing companies often cater to businesses that need certain types of commercial equipment and machinery in specific industries, such as agriculture or construction. A specialized company will understand your business needs. Many of these companies also offer quick approval processes. You may have to shop around for the best available interest rate, and your credit score will affect the interest rate offered to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on what you want to use the loan for, these lenders cannot always offer large enough loans to cover your purchases. Also, not all of these companies are willing to lend to new businesses and, similar to banks, may have requirements when it comes to revenue and credit history. However, because equipment loans are secured with the equipment itself, they are much more likely than other lenders to have loans for startups and early-stage businesses.</span></p>
<h3><b>Online financial platforms</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Option for Growing Businesses </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online lending solutions have flexible financing options that you can use for any business expense, including equipment. Online lenders are more likely to offer term loans and lines of credit even if you do not have business credit history or have a low personal credit score. Typically, you still need to have been in business for more than six months, so they are not the best option for businesses that are not yet established. A key benefit is that online platforms often have quick application and approval processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox provides term loans and lines of credit that you can use to finance the purchase of the equipment you need to get your business started. A term loan is the best option for new businesses. Requirements for a term loan include a minimum revenue of $25,000 per year, at least three months in business, and a minimum credit score of 500. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/#pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates for a term loan vary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and you can choose between 24-week and 52-week term repayment options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line of credit is best if you’ve been in business for a while, as you do need to have annual revenue of $100,000 or more and have been in business for at least six months. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates for a line of credit also vary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, similar to the term loan, you can choose between 12-week and 24-week repayment terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox’s structured repayment plans help you manage your cash flow and pay off your loan reliably, with automatic debiting payments every Wednesday. An added benefit is that there’s no prepayment penalty for paying off your loan in full. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the equipment financing that’s right for your business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of equipment financing options available to you as a new business owner. To start off on the right foot, understand your business goals and map out what you hope to achieve by investing in new equipment. </span></p>

Cash flow refers to the amount of cash that comes into and goes out of your business. For example, a sale is a cash inflow while paying business expenses are cash outflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive cash flow helps you run your business effectively. It allows you to pay your expenses on time and seize opportunities to expand your operations or invest resources back into your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with your balance sheet and income statement, is one of your business’ key financial statements, and it helps you assess the health of your business. Both investors and traditional lenders—like banks—look at your cash flow statement to make informed decisions about providing financing to your business. You can use your cash flow statement to understand how your business is doing and to make strategic choices about how to improve your income streams, minimize your expenses, and run your business better. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the three types of cash flows </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three types of cash flows that you’ll see on your cash flow statement: cash flows from operations (CFO), cash flows from financing (CFF), and cash flows from investing (CFI). </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from operations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFO includes the cash flow inflow that comes directly from sales. This type of cash flow indicates whether you can afford your operating expenses. Your regular bills, like rent and software subscriptions, as well as payroll and inventory costs, are the cash outflows that fall under ‘operations.’</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business’ CFO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps you run your business successfully, and sustainably, in the long run. Looking at your net income on your balance sheet is the starting point for calculating your operating cash flow: how much cash do you have available to cover your operating costs? If you aren’t making enough net income to cover your costs, it’s important to look into different ways to finance your business in the short term as you grow your sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from financing </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFF is the net flows of cash that are used to finance your business that include debt, equity, and dividends. Understanding your CFF will help you keep track of the ways you’re leveraging financing options such as getting a loan (debt), using a line of credit (debt), or receiving investment (equity). Cash outflows here include interest payments and paying dividends to your investors. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flows from investments </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFI is generated cash flow that is used for investments in assets or securities such as stocks and bonds. This type of cash flow is also related to investing in your business. If you’re investing heavily in business development, training, or research, it’s normal to have a negative cash flow in this category. Positive cash flow in this category happens when you make money on your investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining positive cash flow enables you to cover the costs of running your business. Focusing on building positive CFO and CFF allows you to generate the cash flow needed to start creating positive CFI for spending on your business’ growth and investing in strategically chosen securities as you scale your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow vs. profit, cash flow vs. net income</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profit refers to the amount of money left over after certain expenses have been paid (e.g., gross profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold). There are usually several types of profit listed on a financial statement. Calculating profit in different areas of the business allows companies to see which expenses have the biggest impact on the bottom line. Large profits do not necessarily indicate that your business has a healthy cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net income is referred to as the bottom line and represents your revenue minus all expenses, interest, and taxes. Net income is a single number that encompasses your profits. You can use your net income to calculate cash flow in your business. Understanding your cash flow will help you assess the overall profitability of your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow is challenging for every business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow determines whether your business’ doors stay open. Even well-established businesses might struggle with maintaining positive cash flow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different factors can influence cash flow depending on your business model. Small businesses and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-for-freelancers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sole proprietors, like freelancers,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> often deal intimately with CFO issues such as late-paid invoices and fronting costs for supplies and inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you might be charged monthly for expenses like rent and software subscriptions, but you might struggle to ensure that your clients pay their invoices before those bills are due. The project could have generated more than enough revenue to cover those expenses, but if the invoice hasn’t been paid in advance of your bills, you’ll experience negative cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a product-based business, the cost of goods sold (COGS) factors heavily into your CFO strategy. You’ll need to have enough capital upfront to produce the product and there’s often a gap of time between investing in the inventory and getting paid for that inventory. Managing this is an ongoing dance between your financing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re at a business stage where you haven’t looked at financing or investing options, CFO might be your primary cash flow focus. Looking at your CFO will help you determine what types of financing you need and whether raising outside capital will help you reach your business goals.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Master Cash Flow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much cash flow you need is dependent on how much it costs to run and grow your business. The first step to mastering cash flow is to understand your cash inflows and outflows: assessing what resources you have and whether you’re effectively putting those resources towards activities that generate a return on investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a great idea to check on your cash flow statement on a regular basis. Typically, your cash flow needs to be reported both quarterly and annually. There are several formulas you can use to calculate cash flow, but the formula you’ll want to use to determine the profitability of your business is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/033015/what-formula-calculating-free-cash-flow.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free cash flow (FCF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Free cash flow reveals how much money you have left after covering your costs. That extra capital can be used to expand your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s one of the ways to calculate cash flow using the cash flow from operations listed on your cash flow statement and capital expenditures which you can find on your balance sheet: </span></p>
<p><b><i>Free cash flow = cash flow from operations (CFO) &#8211; capital expenditures</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business model includes invoicing clients, one of the ways you can boost your cash flow is to negotiate strict repayment terms with your clients and take the time to understand their repayment habits. Make sure that your contracts lay out payment terms clearly. If you run a product-based business, it’s important to understand your COGS as you may need to cut costs and keep an eye on the time it takes to be repaid for your investment in inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business loans and lines of credit can help support your cash flow as you grow your business. A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/#h-how-you-could-benefit-from-a-business-line-of-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with additional working capital to help you with ongoing operational expenses like purchasing or producing extra inventory, hiring more team members, or expanding your location space. A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/micro-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">micro-loan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you front the cost of major purchases and enable you to repay that balance slowly over time, making it easier to manage those cash inflows with the cash outflow of paying off the loan.</span></p>

There are many financial statements that your business should maintain and refer to, key among these is your profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement. But why is it so important, what can you learn from it, and how do you calculate P&amp;L? Below are answers to these and other frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<h3><b>What does the profit and loss statement show?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement is an important indicator of your business’ health – across its lifecycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup, it can tell you if you’ve reached break-even point. This is the point at which the total cost of goods produced or sold equals the revenue the business makes. Understanding your break-even point can help you price your products, set revenue targets, and identify missing expenses. It’s also a critical part of your business plan. Investors will want to know at what point you stop losing money and begin to turn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A P&amp;L statement will also show how your business performs over time; breaking down revenue generated, and expenses incurred. With these insights, you can see how profitable your business is and how much cash is left over after your losses are accounted. These funds can be used to grow your business, pay off debt, or contribute to your salary as a business owner. The statement also informs where you may need to cut costs to reduce losses and drive revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you are an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will use your P&amp;L statement to report profits and losses on your individual tax return. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you calculate P&amp;L?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your P&amp;L statement will draw on the following data points and calculations: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Sales (or revenue) &#8211; Cost of Sales (or Cost of Goods Sold) = </span><b>Gross Profit (or Gross Margin)</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross Profit &#8211; Operating Expenses = </span><b>Net Operating Profit</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Operating Profit + Other Income &#8211; Other Expenses = </span><b>Net Profit Before Taxes </b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net Profit Before Taxes &#8211; Income Taxes = </span><b>Net Profit (or Loss)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These terms can be confusing. Let’s look at what each means:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The net sales your business made during a certain period. This data point should reflect revenue from your primary business activity but also any gains from other activities such as the sale of assets.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The calculation of all the costs involved in manufacturing or selling a product. These typically include materials, transportation, storage, and labor costs. Knowing your cost of goods sold can help you determine how to price your products to maximize profitability and ensure you’re maintaining sustainable margins. It will also help you identify which product lines may be killing your profitability. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Gross Profit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can arrive at this number by deducting the cost of sales from your business’ net revenue.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Operating Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Expenses are the costs incurred in the daily running of your business – from rent to marketing, training to vehicle mileage. What’s included in operating expenses? The costs can be variable (the cost of labor, materials, supplies, wages), fixed (rent), and accrued (expenses that are incurred but not yet billed for).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Operating Profit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The profit that remains once you’ve deducted selling and administrative costs or expenses.  </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Other Income and Other Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These buckets account for any income or expenses that aren’t related to your company’s main business operations. For example, other income could include royalties, dividends, or gains from the sale of property or other capital assets. Other expenses refer to the costs associated with unexpected losses like repairs or tax penalties.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Net Profit Before Taxes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are your company’s profits before paying income tax. Find it on your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">income statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about each of these </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and why they matter. It’s wise to consult an accountant or bookkeeper if you need help with these calculations.</span></p>
<h3><b>How do you fill out a profit and loss statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many freely available P&amp;L statement templates that you can use. Search online or use one of many Microsoft Office templates. You may need to create separate spreadsheets to calculate each of the data points before entering them in your main P&amp;L statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use accounting software like QuickBooks or FreshBooks you can generate a P&amp;L statement in just a few clicks based on your accounting data. </span></p>
<h3><b>How often should you update your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a goal to update your P&amp;L statement frequently. This may be once a month or once per quarter. If your business is new, your update cycle may be more regular. This allows you to keep an eye on profits and satisfy the needs of investors. Updates will also be prompted by tax season, a new product launch, expansion into a new geography, or the emergence of a new competitor on the block (if your profits are dropping you may need to shift your marketing strategy). </span></p>
<h3><b>How do you interpret your P&amp;L statement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sense of your P&amp;L statement is even more important than maintaining one. If you’re struggling to understand what the numbers are telling you, have a conversation with an accountant. They can help you understand where revenue is being generated, any pitfalls to profitability, and where costs need to be cut. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online accounting software can also support your analysis. Charts and graphs help you visualize key information. You can also drill down to get a more detailed view into transactions associated with each graphic. These reports can also be easily shared with an accountant. </span></p>

<h3><b>What is the difference between a P&amp;L statement and a balance sheet?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/balance-sheet-income-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">balance sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a snapshot of what your business owns (its assets) and what it owes (liabilities).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The balance sheet won’t inform your profitability or cash flow, however, it is the leading indicator of the overall stability and liquidity of your business and is a useful tool for determining how much cash your business has on hand and your ability to fund growth.</span></p>
<h3><b>Do you need to maintain a cash flow statement too?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! It’s critical that you maintain both a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a P&amp;L statement because cash and profitability are two separate indicators. Your cash flow statement provides a detailed picture of where the business’s income comes from and where it goes. If your business shows a profit but maintains a weak cash position, these two statements will give an insight as to why.</span></p>

You’re not alone, especially after the curveball we faced in 2020. Where should you start? While there are a variety of ways to cut expenses, you’ll need to find the right places to make cuts for your unique business. Here’s a guide to help you learn more about your options and how to get started.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to cut expenses?</h2>
<p>When you want to cut business expenses, it means you want to reduce the amount of money you are spending. For example, if you make $15,000 per month but spend $5,000, you may want to reduce the $5,000 in expenses so you can increase your profit margin. You can do so by completely cutting out something you regularly purchase or by reducing the amount you pay for it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn more about how cutting costs and other steps can help you <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow your business on a budget</a>. </em></strong></p>
<h2>How to know where to cut expenses when needed</h2>
<p>If your business is struggling to stay afloat, or if you would just like to maximize your profit margin, it’s probably a good idea to audit your expenses. Here’s how to start.</p>
<h3>Prioritize expenses</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to take inventory of all of your expenses. Ask your accountant to send you an expense report for the past 90 days (or pull it up in your reporting system). Organize your expenses by type (travel, inventory, payroll, bills, etc.). Then, identify which expenses are critical, helpful but not required, and nice but not necessary.</p>
<h3>Identify negotiables</h3>
<p>From there, identify which of the expenses are negotiable. For example, if you have a business phone plan that you need for your employees, you could contact the service provider and ask if there are any promotional plan offerings. You likely have more negotiable expenses than you think such as rent, internet services, merchant account provider fees, vendor prices, insurance premiums, and more.</p>
<h3>Make cuts accordingly</h3>
<p>Negotiate down all of the expenses you can. Then, go through and analyze which of the non-critical expenses you can cut out or reduce. Continue to make cuts until you reach your target expense amount.

<h2>Where can I cut costs for my business?</h2>
<p>Below you’ll find some of the top ways to cut expenses for your business along with money-saving tips.</p>
<h3>Hiring</h3>
<p>Finding new employees and onboarding them can be a time-consuming and expensive process. When it comes time to audit costs, many look to hiring as an area to cut back. How can you save? Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Double down on an employee referral program</li>
<li aria-level="1">Conduct group virtual interviews to save time</li>
<li aria-level="1">Implement extensive phone screenings</li>
<li aria-level="1">Implement pre-qualifications assessments</li>
<li aria-level="1">Write compelling job postings</li>
<li aria-level="1">Brainstorm how to improve employee retention to reduce the need to hire</li>
<li aria-level="1">Streamline your hiring process with technology like an applicant tracking system</li>
<li aria-level="1">Post your jobs on free platforms like Indeed, Google for Jobs, Hubstaff Talent, and on social media platforms (particularly LinkedIn)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Temporarily pause hiring</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these can help you chip away at the potentially high costs of hiring.</p>
<h3>Marketing and advertising</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sba.gov/taxonomy/term/15051?page=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> recommends that you spend 7% to 8% of your budget on marketing if you have revenues of $5 million or less. You could split those expenses between raising brand awareness and promoting your business through advertising, events, or other marketing initiatives. While these expenses are often essential to the success of your business, audit your spending to see what’s working and where you can make cuts.</p>
<p>In crunch times, you’ll want to focus on the channels and strategies that are providing the best results while pulling away from those that aren’t. <em><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a></em> suggests ideas such as improving your customer targeting, reducing your active channels, utilizing marketing automation tools, repurposing older content, and considering shifting to a remote team.</p>
<h3>Business travel</h3>
<p>While the pandemic likely helped to reduce this cost for many businesses, life is returning to normal, which means business travel will likely pick up again. Keeping tabs on these costs starts with adopting a cost-saving mindset. Ask if travel is really necessary or if it can be replaced with a virtual interaction. If travel is required, carefully plan a budget for each trip. Look for opportunities to save through business credit cards with travel perks, establishing relationships with preferred vendors, and consider placing strict limits on expenditures.</p>
<h3>Team perks</h3>
<p>When it comes to team perks, be careful not to damage team morale. Many employees would probably rather remain an employee with fewer perks than become an ex-employee that’s been laid off due to the company’s overspending. In tough times, review the perks you provide along with the costs and analyze which cuts would be most profitable to the bottom line while having the least negative impact on employees. You may want to ask the employees which perks are most beneficial to them and which they don’t value quite as much.</p>
<h3>Current staff and payroll</h3>
<p>Payroll is often the largest expense for a business so it’s important to consider it when you are looking to cut costs. While layoffs should be a last resort, you can consider other ways of reducing costs such as temporarily reducing hours, restricting overtime hours, cross-training employees, using payroll software to automate operations, and making adjustments to optimize benefits like retirement plans, health insurance, and flex spending accounts. You may even want to explore <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing tasks</a> versus hiring full-time employees (where applicable) and offering salary reductions in exchange for a commission-based payment structure.</p>
<h3>Tools and Services</h3>
<p>Many companies have a laundry list of tools that add to their yearly or monthly expenses. When cutting costs, you’ll want to review all the tools and services you currently use to analyze if they are providing the highest ROI possible. In some cases, you may be able to cancel the subscription to a tool that’s not providing value or replace it with one that’s more effective. For example, payroll automation software may help  businesses <a href="https://www.americanpayroll.org/">reduce payroll costs by up to 80%</a>, according to the American Payroll Association. Ensure you have the tools you need, and cancel the tools that are no longer serving you.</p>
<h2>What are the biggest costs for a business?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the biggest business costs come from payroll or human labor, which can account for as much as 70% <a href="https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/the-biggest-cost-of-doing-business-a-closer-look-at-labor-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of business budgets</a>. Included in this category of costs are employee wages, payroll, benefits, and related taxes. Other leading costs for businesses come from overpaying for insurance, overpaying on taxes, and excessive advertising.</p>
<h3>How do you cut expenses drastically?</h3>
<p>To cut expenses drastically,  consider taking a more aggressive approach. This can include only spending money on the line items that are absolutely critical to the continuing operation of your business. Often this requires reducing the largest expenses, which could include payroll. You may need to reduce hours, benefit plans, salaries (including your own), and even, unfortunately, the size of your staff.</p>
<h3>Optimize your budget and grow your business</h3>
<p>The main concept to remember when trying to cut costs is the importance of auditing all of your expenses to ensure you are making the most of every penny you spend. If it’s not essential or not providing ROI, consider cutting it . Sure, making cuts to your budget isn’t fun or easy, but it can give your business the margin it needs to stay afloat and perhaps even grow. In the end, it could benefit you, your employees, and all of your customers.</p>
