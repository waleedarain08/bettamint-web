To support this growth, the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) created the </span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/get-certified"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This program helps LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and business owners to compete in the mainstream marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certification can offer a number of benefits, including helping you connect with other businesses and organizations that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed to diversity and inclusion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also highlights your commitment to equality and helps promote your business as a leader in the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll walk you through the process of getting certified as an LGBTQIA+ owned business and how it can benefit your business moving forward.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is granted by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. The NGLCC is the exclusive, third-party certification body that verifies that eligible businesses are majority-owned by LGBTQIA+ individuals. It also subsequently grants the Certified LGBT Business Enterprise® (Certified LGBTBE®) designation to such businesses as part of its</span><a href="https://www.nglcc.org/SDI-FAQ#1a"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBT Supplier Diversity Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This certification gives LGBTQIA+ business owners access to a number of benefits, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A powerful business network of over 200 corporate partners. Each partner is committed to supplier diversity and the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ owned businesses in their supply chains.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased visibility for your business through NGLCC’s extensive online database of Certified LGBTBE® companies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to NGLCC’s national, international, and local events throughout the year.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who qualifies for LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for NGLCC certification, your business must be majority-owned by an LGBTQIA+ person or persons. In addition, at least 51 percent of the management and daily operations of the company must be controlled by LGBTQIA+ individuals. The application process includes providing documentation to prove both ownership and citizenship.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the benefits of LGBTBE® certification?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LGBTQIA+ community is a thriving economic driver. In fact, data shows that there is over</span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/334983"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.7 trillion dollars in purchasing power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the LGBTQIA+ community. In addition, research from the NGLCC found that LGBTQIA+ buyers are 75 percent more likely to change brands if they know they are inclusive of the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does LGBTBE® certification connect you with like-minded business owners and corporate allies, but it also allows your company to tap into a whole host of exclusive opportunities. Some of these include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to exclusive networking and business development opportunities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free or discounted rates for NGLCC events and webinars.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentorship and educational programs through the NGLCC network.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounts on products and services from NGLCC partners.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarship opportunities through Tuck&#8217;s School of Business Executive Education Program at Dartmouth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) to consumers, employees, and partners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, diversity and inclusion has become a top priority for many American businesses. Gaining LGBTBE® certification can help you stand out when competing for business opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also serve as a role model for up-and-coming LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and help pave the way for a more inclusive economy.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for LGBTBE® certification are available online through the NGLCC. There is a four-step application process for businesses that wish to become certified. Application fees are typically waived for any business that is already a member of a local NGLCC-affiliated Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s how to get started.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Fill out the online application</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, create a business profile on</span><a href="http://my.nglcc.org/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">my.nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this stage, you need to provide documentation to prove that you meet the requirements for certification. The required paperwork must attest that each majority company owner is LGBTQIA+ and that they have control, manage, operate, and possess at least 51 percent of the firm. You can learn more about the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/steps-lgbtbe-certification"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">specific documentation required for NGLCC certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note there is a $400 fee (current to the time of this post’s publication) to submit your application.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Schedule an on-site visit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Certified LGBTBE® companies must provide site visits to the NGLCC&#8217;s regional certification committees. These visits serve two purposes: First, they provide an opportunity for the committee to become familiar with the business and its day-to-day operations. Second, these visits give committee members a chance to get to know you and your business goals better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site visits are generally 30 minutes long and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Your application will be reviewed</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your visit, the National Certification Committee will determine your certification status. This process can take up to 90 days.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Get approved and onboarded</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your application is approved, you&#8217;ll be invited to participate in an orientation webinar. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the benefits of certification and how to make the most of them.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTBE® certification for people of color</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intersectionality is a key value at NGLCC, which is why they&#8217;ve committed to promoting LGBTBE® certification for people of color through the</span><a href="https://nglcc.org/coci"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities of Color Initiative (CoCI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are a person of color and are interested in getting certified, reach out to </span><a href="mailto:coci@nglcc.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coci@nglcc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTQIA+ businesses who are also </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/loans-minority-owned-businesses-10-options-consider/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minority business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may also be eligible for Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) certification, which can offer additional opportunities for government contracts and set-asides (contracts that the government has set aside for businesses that comply with certain requirements). Learn more about </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/get-certified-minority-business-enterprise/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MBE certification here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrate your pride with LGBTBE® certification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming a Certified LGBTBE® company can help your business connect with a wider community of LGBTQIA+ supporters, as well as government institutions and funding options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention, by increasing your business&#8217;s visibility as an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone, you&#8217;re not only supporting the LGBTQIA+ community, but also helping to create a more diverse and prosperous future for us all.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="477" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="choosing a bank" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy-768x477.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-copy.jpg 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, one of your most important partnerships is with your bank. When you’re choosing where to do your small business banking, it’s important to research which institutions will meet your unique needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that many financial services are available online, your list of options is growing, and it can be overwhelming to figure out the best place to start. Many banks offer similar features and services, but not all of them will be the right fit for your business as it grows. Here are a few factors you should keep in mind as you look for the right bank for your small business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know your business goals and assess your financial history </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A critical first step is to review </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where your business is now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and where it’s headed. You should choose a bank that can grow with you. You might not need products like a business loan in the next six months, but you may need one as you build on your success and continue to expand your business in a year. For example, you may need accounts that allow you to upgrade to handle more transactions as you take on clients or suppliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been in business for a while, take a look at the last 6 to 12 months of financial history and cash flow patterns. Understanding how you spend and receive money will indicate which banking features you’ll need. Do you need higher limits on your credit card? Will you need access to small business loans? Would a business line of credit help you better manage gaps in cash flow?  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your credit score. If your score is low, large national banks may not approve you for all the products you need. You can always sign on with a major bank or credit union and choose online lending options to leverage in tandem when you need access to additional funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you expand your business, you might want to take advantage of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Administration’s (SBA) loan programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offer affordable financing options to small businesses. Look for institutions that provide SBA-backed loans and resources tailored to small businesses. Also, credit unions and regional or local banks often have programs specifically geared towards small businesses in their area.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware of fees for the features you’ll use the most</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good idea of your business’s financial patterns, you should look for banks with products and services that help you maintain or improve your finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very least, you need to have a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/open-business-bank-account/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business checking account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to house funds and for your everyday transactions. Some banks charge fees if you do not maintain a minimum account balance, but that may not be an issue if you know that you always have extra cash to keep the balance high. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you grow your business, you’ll likely need credit cards with higher limits or access to funding options like business loans and lines of credit, which come with their own costs. Additionally, you might need to be able to upgrade your accounts to allow for more transactions throughout the month without incurring extra fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking into extra financing for your business, always look for options that have a low annual percentage rate (APR), which means the institution isn’t charging too many fees on top of your interest payment. Many online financial platforms offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flexible business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with low or no additional fees. For example, Fundbox does not charge origination fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re looking into ways to save money on your small business banking services, see if you can earn money through the interest rates offered on your desired accounts.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that banking is about building a relationship </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bank is part of your business. When you develop a relationship with your bank, they’re likely to see you as less of a risk over time, making it easier to secure financing like loans, lines of credit, and mortgages. It’s easier to build a personal relationship with your bank if you choose a local bank or credit union, especially those that are invested in supporting small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller banks may also have advisory services and resources specifically geared towards small business owners. Developing a personal relationship with your banker or advisor means that they get to know your business and can suggest the best products to help you grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for banks that have experience in your industry and understand your business. Many national banks have specialized industry bankers who know the challenges that your particular business might face and can recommend more personalized solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s helpful to choose a bank that has a physical branch where you can meet with a banker or advisor in person, particularly when you need to resolve issues or when you’re looking for advice about the products they offer. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about convenience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business owner, you’re likely wearing many hats and juggling several aspects of your operations every day. The </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/best-banks-for-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best banks for small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it as easy as possible to manage your finances when it’s convenient for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online options enable you to handle your everyday banking from anywhere, at any time. However, if you run a brick-and-mortar business, choose a bank with a physical branch that’s close to your location, making it easy to complete regular cash deposits. Ensure that the bank’s hours fit around your business hours so you can spend your time focusing on your customers during that time, rather than standing in line at the bank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you travel nationally for your business, you’ll want to select small business banking options that are available across every state, or institutions with low fees for using other banks’ ATMs and services. This is also a major consideration if you travel internationally. Narrow down the options that offer you optimal support and access to your money everywhere you do business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you should choose a bank with the right balance of online accessibility, convenient branch locations, and overall exceptional customer service. Think of your bank as an extension of your business, like a supplier or retailer. The best bank for you is the one that will help you through every stage of your business journey. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business credit profile is one measure of the financial health of your company, and a reflection of how your business meets its financial obligations. Establishing a credit history and building good business credit are essential to the success of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to build business credit, it’s important to understand one of its key contributing factors: your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/increase-business-credit-score/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business credit score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you&#8217;re seeking financing, showing your creditworthiness will be a big part of applying and getting approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But your business credit profile (and business credit score) come up in more situations, too. For example, if you’re looking to negotiate good terms with your suppliers, get the best lease on commercial property, or secure good insurance premiums, your good business credit could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, good business credit makes for a sustainable, growth-oriented business. Here are some things you can do to help build good business credit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 things you can do to establish and build your business credit</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Check your personal and business credit files</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you want to do is check your personal and business credit score. For your personal score, go to </span><a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AnnualCreditReport.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a free source of credit reports </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports"><span style="font-weight: 400;">verified by the government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and operated by the three national reporting companies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. By Federal law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from the credit bureaus every 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/analyze-business-credit-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check your report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for errors. Look for any inaccuracies in every section, including your personal information, SSN, accounts, and loans. Report any incorrect information to the business that issued the account or the credit reporting company that issued the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, check out your business credit report. You can request these from </span><a href="https://www.dnb.com/products/small-business/check-my-business-credit.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.experian.com/small-business/business-credit-reports.jsp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.equifax.com/business/business-credit-reports-small-business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equifax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t have a credit file with these agencies or are new to business, you can set one up by registering for a D-U-N-S number (used to identify companies in the U.S.) with Dun &amp; Bradstreet. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Add trade references to your credit file</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade references are vital to a strong business credit score. These reflect your good record of payments with suppliers and vendors. Some will be proactive about sharing this information with the credit reporting agencies, but they aren’t required to do so. You can also add them on your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your score is determined by a few things, including the number of trade experiences you have, outstanding balances, payment habits, and demographics (such as years on file, business size, etc.)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish credit with vendors and suppliers who report to credit bureaus</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all vendors, suppliers, businesses, and others with whom your business interacts will report to the credit bureaus. But working with those who do is a way to build business credit and boost your business credit score. A history of responsible payment (on time, or even early) builds good business credit, so ask your vendors and others whether they report your payment activity. Your strong credit rating may help you increase your borrowing power, obtain more favorable financing terms from lenders, or increase the likelihood of other businesses working with you.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Get a business credit card</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/best-business-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business credit cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be an indispensable asset for any business. Of course, you can use this card to pay for business expenses such as supplies and equipment, and most cards come with perks such as cash back or travel rewards. But equally important, if you use it responsibly and reliably pay on time, a business credit card can also be leveraged to build strong business credit history and a solid credit rating, potentially helping your business qualify for additional — and better — financing options in the future, should you need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do keep in mind that if you’re looking to finance large purchases of equipment or to capitalize on a timely but costly opportunity for your business’s growth, a business credit card likely will not be sufficient for your needs. A better, more flexible financing option for such purchases is a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-business-line-credit-can-help-grow-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers a revolving balance that replenishes as you pay off what you’ve used. If you’re looking for a line of credit for your business, you may want to consider a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox Line of Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make payments to creditors on time or early</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your payment habits have a big impact on your credit score. If you pay before a due date, or even 15-30 days in advance (cash flow permitting), you’ll improve your Dun &amp; Bradstreet Paydex score. The Paydex score ranges from 1–100 and is an important indicator of a business’s past payment performance. The higher the Paydex score, the greater the likelihood that a business will pay its debts on time. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor your business credit reports</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve spent so much time building your credit, keep an eye on it. As noted, you are able to access your personal credit report for free on an annual basis, and it’s a smart idea to do just that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may want to keep even closer track of your business credit report. </span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/free-business-credit-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 5 places you can go to check your business credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But you most likely want to check your business credit report much more frequently than once per year. If you want to check it on a monthly basis, look to any of the top business credit agencies (Experian, Equifax, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet). They all offer a range of business credit monitoring services, but be aware that you will likely have to pay for this, and prices vary. However, monitoring is important if you’re actively looking to build credit. Monitoring will let you know when new activity is detected and allow you to stay on top of any mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrating responsible management of your business credit will help provide your business with more options, from availability of financing to favorable loan terms to access to suppliers and vendors. Simply put, building strong business credit is a key factor in establishing and growing your successful small business. </span></p>

The value a good accountant can offer your business cannot be overstated. It’s one of the most important decisions you can make for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A qualified and reliable accountant can help you handle dynamic and ever-evolving tax laws and navigate circumstances that could help you to scale your business in the most optimal, efficient, and economical ways. Choosing the right accountant can help you take your business to the next level; choosing the wrong accountant can be counterproductive to your business’s health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s vital that you know what to look for in a business accountant and put in the research to ensure you choose a professional who is the right fit for your business. Here are five tips to help you choose the best accountant for your small business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand your needs </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire an accountant, you should first have a basic understanding of what you want the accountant to do for you. Do you need someone to handle bookkeeping and financial statements? Or an accountant to help you prepare and file your taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bookkeeper or non-certified accountant can help with day-to-day accounting; however, if you require someone to provide strategic tax advice, file your taxes, or assist with an audit, you might be best off choosing a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Understanding the responsibilities and work you need help with, and how often, is an important step toward finding an accountant. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek referrals and reviews</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you friends with other entrepreneurs or part of a small business association or network in your community? One way to discover a dependable accountant for your business is to ask for recommendations from your peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you might also conduct a Google search to find accountants in your area. You can also seek out online reviews and use them to compare and evaluate prospects. LinkedIn, Yelp, or other online communities like Reddit and Facebook may also be helpful resources for referrals and reviews that could inform your decision.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate their qualifications and experience </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reputable accountant should have the qualifications and experience to support their knowledge and expertise. It may be in your best interest to look for an accountant who has experience working with other businesses in the same industry as you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be beneficial because they are likely to be familiar with the needs, challenges, and tax laws specific to your business type or industry. Training and formal qualifications will determine the type of accountant you can hire and the services they can provide. Here are some qualifications to look for in an accountant: </span></p>
<h3><b>CPA certification</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certified public accountant, or CPA, is an accounting professional who has passed the CPA exam and maintains the necessary qualifications to be a licensed CPA. All 50 states have different CPA licenses, and requirements for certification vary by state. In addition to the exam, applicants often need to have a bachelor’s degree and two years of experience in accounting. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has a </span><a href="https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic/findacpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can use to find CPAs, accounting companies, and local accounting organizations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMA is an accounting designation that signifies expertise in financial accounting and </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategic-management.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The certification is sponsored by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). Candidates must have a bachelor&#8217;s degree and two consecutive years in management accounting or financial management. </span></p>
<h3><b>Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CGMA is a global certification issued by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) for CPAs who work in business and government. This certification distinguishes professionals who have advanced proficiency in finance, operations, strategy, and management.</span></p>
<h3><b>Enrolled Agent (EA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EA credential recognizes professionals, including CPAs, licensed by the government to represent taxpayers. They advise clients, prepare personal and business taxes, and deal with the Internal Revenue Service on matters related to business or personal tax audits. The certification is awarded by the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/enrolled-agent-information#:~:text=An%20enrolled%20agent%20is%20a,as%20a%20former%20IRS%20employee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Other certifications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many additional accounting certifications that recognize specific skills. These include Accredited Payables Manager (APM), Accredited Payables Specialist (APS), Accredited Receivables Specialists (ARS), and Certified Payroll Professional (CPP).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with prospective candidates and ask questions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve conducted your initial research and compiled a list of a few prospects, it’s time to conduct a series of meetings or interviews with them. This is your opportunity to ask questions and gain a better understanding of how they work. Of course, you might find the answers to some of these questions with a little online research, but it’s still a good idea to spend a few minutes with a prospective accountant to get a better idea of whether they might be the right fit for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few questions you might ask prospective accountants: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What accounting qualifications and training do you have?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of accounting services do you offer?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your fees and how do you charge? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of clients do you work with? Do you have experience with other clients in my industry? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What technology or software do you use? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you support my goals? What additional value could you offer my business? </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider how they’ll help your business grow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to weigh your options and carefully consider if the accountant you’re considering will be the professional whose financial advice will help you make successful long-range decisions for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some accountants will simply focus on completing the task at hand. They will fill out tax returns and manage your accounts, while others will be more proactive in handling your finances. When you are choosing a business accountant, you should always ask what recommendations they have for saving your company money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business succeed. Before you choose your small business accountant, you should consider how this professional relationship will ultimately help contribute to, support, and guide your business growth. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to look at an accountant as an integral member of your team. After all, they can play a pivotal role in the success of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business thrive. On the flip side, an inexperienced or otherwise unqualified accountant can be extremely counterproductive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure you </span><a href="https://1800accountant.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose the accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is the best fit for your business, be selective and take your time with the decision. Ultimately, you want to choose an accountant who is within your budget, reliable, reputable, dedicated to supporting your goals, and committed to helping you scale your business (if that’s part of your business plan) and save money. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="511" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/construction-lunch-768x511.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="construction workers at lunch" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/construction-lunch-768x511.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/construction-lunch.jpg 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For construction and landscaping companies, business typically heats up during the summer months. While this is undoubtedly positive for those businesses, the busiest time of the year can present unique cash flow challenges for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate a construction company, for example, you might have funds tied up in supplies and building materials. That can make it harder to pay for other vital expenses — like payroll, utilities, gasoline, insurance, and more. You might also have to pay contractors and subcontractors before your customers settle their bills. Then, there’s always the risk that a job runs over budget, leaving you with a skinnier profit margin than you planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landscaping companies run into similar problems. With more lawns to mow and more gardens to maintain, you might decide to buy or lease more equipment — tying up cash along the way. Customers might not always pay their invoices on time either, creating additional financial challenges.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade credit: The $3.1 trillion question</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One primary reason that construction and landscaping companies — along with businesses in virtually all other industries — run into cash flow problems is that they deal in</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/trade-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trade credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Trade credit, also called “net terms,” refers to the conventional method of financing transactions between sellers and buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how trade credit works: A seller might pay upfront for inventory, services, or supplies to a buyer, giving them 30, 60, 90, or even 120 days to pay their bills. A landscaping subcontractor, for example, might invoice their clients at the end of the month and then give them 30 days to pay from there. On the flip side, a construction company might use trade credit to get building materials, tools, roofing supplies, and more from a supplier and have 60 days before payment is due.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, sellers—who would undoubtedly prefer to be paid immediately on every sale—accept trade credit because it’s the standard. Without offering it, it’s nearly impossible for those sellers to compete. Buyers, however, typically like the arrangement because they’re able to purchase more than they otherwise could, which helps them grow their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that according to research from</span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2019/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PYMNTS and Fundbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, trade credit has severe, often damaging financial implications for U.S. businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PYMNTS survey found that on any given day U.S. companies are collectively owed $3.1 trillion in unpaid invoices, making it that much harder for them to run their businesses. When merchants extend trade credit, they themselves cannot plan to get paid on time, as some customers will pay even later than the agreed-to terms. </span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/report-the-reason-48-pct-of-high-margin-smbs-pay-suppliers-late/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these customers expect to be able to pay late</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they consider themselves to be such good customers. For years, this has been the norm, especially in B2B transactions and certain trades like construction or landscaping.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge with traditional trade credit arrangements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trade credit essentially makes the companies that extend it assume the role of a bank for their clients—but without the upside (like the interest that accrues immediately). Even if every single client pays on time, there are still massive administrative implications to consider. For example, reviewing applications for trade credit, approving those applications, setting up new customers with accounts or terms, making sure invoices are sent on time, keeping track of who owes what, and staying on top of when payments are due are all time-consuming back-office tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say in the age of automation, the current system of trade credit leaves a lot to be desired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s more, while receivables might look beautiful on the balance sheet, you can’t exactly use those funds to grow a business. Managing day-to-day operations while waiting for funds to arrive can be needlessly stressful and challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for pursuing new opportunities or investing in new initiatives? That’s often out of the question, too, without a comfortable sum in the bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that no matter which side of the transaction you’re on, your construction or landscaping business can take advantage of innovative new solutions offered by fintech companies. Technology is rapidly expanding opportunities for businesses to get easier access to the funds they need to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fundbox can help you access the working capital your business needs through a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

While the buzz of “going green” may have faded a bit in recent years, the reasons to celebrate Earth Day and have an earth-friendly business are more important than ever. Earth Day is the perfect time to review your small business’s operating plan with an environmentally conscious eye and see where you may be able to make changes that will not only help your business’s bottom line, but help the environment, too. Here are a few areas to consider.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Become more energy-efficient</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making your commercial office, home office, or retail shop more energy-efficient isn’t as difficult as it may seem. It may only require small tweaks to things you are already doing. Some possibilities include changing out regular light bulbs with their energy-efficient counterparts, using power-saving settings on office computers, and upgrading to a programmable thermostat. For more ideas and a checklist to help you execute efficiency in your business, download the </span><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/tools/ENERGYSTAR_Small_Business_AWB_Main_508_November_2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENERGY STAR® Action Workbook for Small Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Go paperless</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10655-paperless-office.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going paperless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — or even moving to a more “paper-reduced” business — comes with significant environmental benefits while saving money for your business. With the cloud-based technology we have today, going paperless is no longer unachievable. In fact, you probably already have a good deal of the technology needed for a paperless office in place. With some changes, such as moving all contracts and invoicing to a secure online platform, you can slowly move your business closer to a paperless state.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Allow telecommuting</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecommuting is good for the environment, saves your employees money, and reduces overhead expenses in your business — and </span><a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20over%20the%20past,and%20are%2047%25%20more%20productive."><span style="font-weight: 400;">productivity increases </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when employees work remotely. The past couple of years have necessitated a work-from-home status for many of us, and now both employers and employees are anticipating this trend will continue. If it works in your business, you can create a telecommuting policy that allows your employees to work remotely on a part-time basis. Offering this type of benefit can even help you attract and retain talent in your business.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Set the expectations for your team</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going green only works with consistent effort from everyone on your team, so you need to get your entire staff on board. Set office-wide rules for recycling, conserving energy by shutting off lights, and guidelines for purchasing supplies and working with vendors. You may also want to give your employees a chance to weigh in and offer their own suggestions for creating an earth-friendly office. You can even consider offering an incentive for the best green idea for the office or an award to one employee a month who goes above and beyond in improving the eco-consciousness of your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business — and the environment — will get the most benefit when you focus on implementing these ideas all year long, so celebrate Earth Day and use it as a catalyst for creating your “go green” plan. Start rolling out environmentally friendly changes in your business this year!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="475" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver-768x475.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="women truck driver" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver-768x475.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Women-Truck-Driver.jpg 1142w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That old adage, “You need to spend money to make money,” applies directly to leveraging equipment financing for your small business. Whether you’re a restaurateur who needs to outfit a kitchen with commercial appliances and tools, a nail technician looking for salon chairs, or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-get-equipment-financing-for-your-construction-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction startup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring heavy machinery, fronting the cost of the equipment you need to operate your business — before you have revenue — is a challenge for every entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are many </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding options </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meet this challenge, including commercial equipment loans, general small business loans, and credit. Traditional lenders like banks may be a good choice if you have been in business for more than two years, but for younger businesses, equipment financing companies provide opportunities to acquire the equipment you need, even if you do not  have credit history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New equipment can help you optimize and expand your operations. Equipment also helps you earn more revenue, which, in turn, can help you pay down the balance of your equipment loan. In short, equipment financing is the type of debt that allows you to acquire a revenue-generating asset — a strategic decision that can strengthen your business. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is equipment financing? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing is funding specifically designed for purchases of equipment you’ll use to operate your business. This can include anything from laptops and office furniture to vehicles and construction or farming machinery. If you do not have the working capital available to purchase more expensive types of equipment, financing can help front the cost so you can start growing your operations. </span></p>
<h4><b>Benefits of equipment financing</b><b></b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many lenders use the equipment itself as collateral. If you default on the loan, the lender will repossess the equipment to cover the loss. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you leverage equipment loans to buy the equipment you need outright, you may be able to claim the full price of the equipment as a deduction on your taxes under </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-179.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 179 of the IRS tax code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Equipment leasing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another equipment financing option to consider is leasing, an agreement that’s similar to leasing a car, where you essentially rent the equipment you need and pay the lease provider in monthly installments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some benefits of leasing include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You typically do not have to provide a down payment or collateral.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be able to qualify for a lease even if you have a low credit score. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to renew your lease agreement when the term ends, continuing with both monthly payments and use of the equipment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lease-to-own programs allow you to take possession of the equipment once the initial lease is paid off. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the downsides of leasing is that your equipment will not be considered a fixed asset on your financial statements and will not count towards your business’s net worth. However, </span><a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/tax-implications-of-leasing-business-equipment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be able to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim lease payments as a rent expense on your taxes. </span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you need to qualify for equipment financing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new business owners, the ability to secure financing through traditional lenders can be a challenge, as most of these lenders are reluctant to take a risk on a business with no credit or established sales history. Many lenders will check your personal credit history if your business doesn’t yet have a credit history. You may also be required to provide a personal guarantee, which means that you’re responsible for repaying the debt with your own money or assets.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To qualify for equipment loans, most lenders will require you to provide information about how the equipment will help you run your business or increase profitability. Therefore, at the outset, it’s a good idea to understand how the equipment will deliver a return on investment and to have a thorough plan that outlines how you will use the loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also need to know how much funding you actually need. Some lenders can offer up to $5 million, while others cap funding at $100,000 or less. Be aware that if you secure a loan for more than you’ll use, you’ll likely be charged a prepayment fee if you want to pay the remainder of the balance off earlier than the agreed-upon time frame — similar to a mortgage. Finally, it’s important to understand what type of repayment terms will work best for your business, as loan payments will affect your cash flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re just starting out, it can seem like you need to buy everything you imagine you’ll need right away. Determining which pieces of equipment are essential can help you invest in purchases that will have the biggest impact. You can always combine loans for high-priority equipment with leasing for low-priority equipment to avoid sinking money into items you might not end up using. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing options </span></h2>
<h3><b>Small Business Administration (SBA) loans</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for Brand New Businesses or Growing Businesses</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-2-sba-504-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 504 loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $5 million (with repayment terms up to 25 years) are available through Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and can be used for heavy equipment you plan to use long-term. Here are some of the key requirements for a 504 loan that you should be aware of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a tangible net worth of less than $15 million and have made under $5 million in the last two years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have proof that you haven’t been able to secure funding from another source.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must provide a personal guarantee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equipment itself must be used as collateral. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3 percent fee will be tacked onto the value of the loan plus the interest rate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/sba-loans/#h-1-sba-7a-loans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBA 7(a) loans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are also a popular choice for small business financing. However, some key differences make this a less desirable option: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7(a) loan has a variable interest rate, while the 504 offers a fixed rate, at an increment above the current market rate for 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury issues.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7(a) loan may require a larger down payment, up to 30 percent of the loan, while only 10 percent is required for a 504 loan. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses will find it easier to gain approval for an SBA loan. However, the loan application process can take up to eight weeks, which is something to consider if you need the funds quickly. </span></p>
<h3><b>Term loans from banks</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Option for Mature Businesses</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term loans are a good option if you’ve been in business for a while, but they are not the best option for new businesses. To qualify for this type of loan, you need to have proven, consistent revenue and a good credit score. For example, the </span><a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/smallbusiness/business-financing/business-equipment-loans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bank of America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires you to have been in business for at least two years and have a minimum of $250,000 in annual revenue. One of the benefits of term loans is that they don’t necessarily need to be used for commercial equipment or machinery; you can use them to pay for anything your business needs. </span></p>
<h3><b>Credit</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for Brand New Businesses </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business lines of credit and business credit cards are alternatives to equipment loans that enable you to access funds quickly. The benefit of these sources of funding is that once you’ve paid down a portion of the balance, you can use those funds as working capital in your business again. The downside is that they might not be able to provide the amount of funding you need to make larger purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another downside is interest rates. Lines of credit often have higher interest rates than loans. Business credit cards have interest rates that are higher still (up to </span><a href="https://www.creditcardsexplained.com/cards-for/business?sid=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioIkt6wM9DjIhv2xMss5Vgxoa9GnnRWNxF1kdL2IPkeiCPkklUuzyukaAtXZEALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 percent APR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and often have fees associated with them. Additionally, some equipment vendors do not take credit cards as a form of payment. </span></p>
<h3><b>Loans from equipment financing companies</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessible Option for New Businesses </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment financing companies often cater to businesses that need certain types of commercial equipment and machinery in specific industries, such as agriculture or construction. A specialized company will understand your business needs. Many of these companies also offer quick approval processes. You may have to shop around for the best available interest rate, and your credit score will affect the interest rate offered to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on what you want to use the loan for, these lenders cannot always offer large enough loans to cover your purchases. Also, not all of these companies are willing to lend to new businesses and, similar to banks, may have requirements when it comes to revenue and credit history. However, because equipment loans are secured with the equipment itself, they are much more likely than other lenders to have loans for startups and early-stage businesses.</span></p>
<h3><b>Online financial platforms</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Option for Growing Businesses </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online lending solutions have flexible financing options that you can use for any business expense, including equipment. Online lenders are more likely to offer term loans and lines of credit even if you do not have business credit history or have a low personal credit score. Typically, you still need to have been in business for more than six months, so they are not the best option for businesses that are not yet established. A key benefit is that online platforms often have quick application and approval processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox provides term loans and lines of credit that you can use to finance the purchase of the equipment you need to get your business started. A term loan is the best option for new businesses. Requirements for a term loan include a minimum revenue of $25,000 per year, at least three months in business, and a minimum credit score of 500. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/term-loan/#pricing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates for a term loan vary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and you can choose between 24-week and 52-week term repayment options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line of credit is best if you’ve been in business for a while, as you do need to have annual revenue of $100,000 or more and have been in business for at least six months. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/pricing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rates for a line of credit also vary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, similar to the term loan, you can choose between 12-week and 24-week repayment terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox’s structured repayment plans help you manage your cash flow and pay off your loan reliably, with automatic debiting payments every Wednesday. An added benefit is that there’s no prepayment penalty for paying off your loan in full. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the equipment financing that’s right for your business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of equipment financing options available to you as a new business owner. To start off on the right foot, understand your business goals and map out what you hope to achieve by investing in new equipment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dust in the attic hasn’t even settled on your holiday decorations before retailers are stocking their shelves with Valentine&#8217;s Day cards and candy. You may dismiss Valentine’s Day as a Hallmark holiday that’s best suited for restaurants, florists, and jewelers. So what does it have to do with your B2B service or startup business? Plenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social holidays—such as Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, and Halloween—are a great way to engage current clients and potential customers. Sure, there may be people in your audience who don’t celebrate these holidays, but the risk of losing a few email subscribers or social media followers is largely outweighed by the potential engagement you could get from these social moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few clever ways to take advantage of social holidays to help drive engagement and connect with your clients.</span></p>
<h3><b>Send snail mail</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday cards aren’t just for December. Spread mid-year cheer with physical cards sent via the postal service. Wish your clients a happy Valentine’s Day and let them know you appreciate their business. For a bonus, include a handwritten note. Writing something personalized can be very impactful, leaving your clients feeling special long after they’ve opened the envelope. A personalized message can also help you impress that elusive client who has been on the cusp of handing you their business. Let them know you care, and you could end up winning their business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Create a seasonal website page</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give clients and potential new customers a reason to visit your website. For a small fee you can hire a web developer to create a seasonal landing page, reengaging customers and creating new interest in your page. Web developers can also create a holiday-themed game on your website where users can click on hearts or candy to win discounts or prizes. Send out an email that directs clients and prospects to your updated page or newly added game, and you’re sure to see an uptick in visits to your site—inevitably reminding visitors what services you offer and why they might need your business.</span></p>
<h3><b>Engage on social media</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social holidays are a great way to engage with users on social media. Make sure you insert yourself into the Valentine’s Day conversation by using hashtags and posting holiday-themed content that’s relevant to your business. You can even ask your customers what they’re doing to celebrate, using the holiday to drive engagement and create conversation with your customer base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take it a step further? You can update your business’ banner or social media logo to coincide with the theme of the holiday. While it may seem simple, this update will let your followers know that you’re active on the platform. Just make sure to revert your banner and logo back once the holiday is over so you don’t appear to be inactive and the channels don’t seem neglected.</span></p>
<h3><b>Run a marketing campaign</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company is ready to take on new business, using holiday-themed content in a marketing email or social media post will instantly make your messaging seem timely and relevant. This is a great way to repurpose existing content and to freshen up old messaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can reach out to customers to wish them a happy Valentine’s Day, and while you’re at it, you can remind them of the great services you offer or any promotions you have going on. Holidays are a great way to “break the ice” of a cold email, and it can make your brand seem more personable and relatable, too. </span></p>
<h3><b>Support your customers, employees, or ‌charity </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday doesn’t necessarily have to be about driving business. Instead of pushing clients to engage in your services, you can use holidays as an opportunity to give back. Maybe you can budget in a small gift or discount for each of your clients. In addition to being a nice treat, it also gives clients a reason to reach out once the holiday has passed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could also consider using the holiday as an employee appreciation day, bringing in a little sweet treat to let your employees know how much you care. If you do treat your team, make sure you capture it on social media. It’s a great chance to show your customers a behind-the-scenes view of what it’s like inside your company—giving them the warm and fuzzies, too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to spread the love this Valentine’s Day is by creating a small online fundraiser for your favorite charity or organizing a blanket or toy drive for a local animal shelter. Bonus points if you choose a charity or cause that is related to your business, giving your current and potential customers yet another reason to enjoy doing business with you.</span></p>

It provides coverage to small businesses for claims resulting from bodily injury, property damage, copyright infringement, and reputation harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look more closely at what general liability insurance covers, what it doesn’t cover, and who needs it. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance coverage protects your business from some of the most common claims </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/llc-business-taxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business owners face</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Paying for any one of these would be incredibly expensive without some kind of business insurance to cover you. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party bodily injury</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a brick-and-mortar business and a customer is injured at your store, you’re responsible for covering their medical costs. Not to mention, if it’s determined that the accident is your fault, that customer could decide to sue you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unfortunately, these types of accidents are not uncommon. </span><a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2015/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Hartford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 10% of businesses have a customer slip and fall on their premises, and these accidents cost about $30,000 to resolve. General liability insurance will cover any costs involved with a customer accident. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party property damage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property damage is another common liability claim. This happens when a customer’s property is damaged while they are at your business or when a customer’s property is damaged while you’re visiting them on business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good example of this is a general contractor accidentally damaging a client’s property while working on their home. As a business owner, you’re responsible for paying for the necessary repairs. General liability insurance will cover some or all of the associated costs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copyright infringement happens when you’re accused of stealing someone else’s ideas and using them in your marketing or advertising. It can also involve claims that you copied another company’s product and sold it as your own. This can be an expensive problem to fix, especially if it leads to a lawsuit. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation harm happens when you make a public statement about a business owner that hurts their business. According to The Hartford, reputation management is the most expensive problem most businesses encounter and can cost up to $50,000 to fix. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Isn’t Covered By Business Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business liability insurance is a comprehensive insurance policy that covers some of the most common incidents business owners face. But it doesn’t cover everything, and knowing what isn’t covered is just as important as knowing what is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, no insurance policy is the same, so you should check the policy guidelines for your general liability insurance policy. But here are some of the most common exclusions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Auto accidents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> general liability insurance doesn’t cover auto accidents that happen while you or your employees are on the job. Commercial auto insurance can protect you from these types of accidents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Employee injuries: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee becomes injured as a result of their work, general liability insurance doesn’t cover that either. Workers’ compensation insurance protects employees from workplace accidents or illnesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Damage to your property:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> General liability insurance protects you from damage to a customer’s property, but it won’t protect you from your own property damage. Commercial property insurance can help with that.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Professional errors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, general liability insurance won’t cover you if a customer sues you due to a professional error that harms their business. Professional liability insurance will help with that. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s always a good idea to be aware of the coverage limits on your general liability policy. If you feel like your coverage is a bit low, it may be worthwhile to purchase a commercial umbrella insurance policy to cover more expensive claims.  </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Much Coverage Do I Need?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.insureon.com/small-business-insurance/general-liability/cost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Insureon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most small businesses choose a standard coverage limit of $1 million per occurrence with a $2 million aggregate policy limit. So for a single claim, you’ll receive up to $1 million with a $2 million limit for that policy period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you will have to pay the insurance deductible before the insurance company will payout on your claim. You’ll choose your deductible when you initially purchase general liability insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of your deductible, the type of business you run, and your industry will all affect your monthly insurance rate. Insureon also found that the median cost of general liability insurance is $42 per month or $500 annually. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Needs General Liability Insurance?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most states won’t require business owners to carry small business liability insurance, so you can purchase this insurance at your own discretion. But if you choose to forgo general liability insurance, you could be putting your business and your livelihood at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, most businesses need general liability insurance, especially if you own an office or storefront that’s open to customers or vendors. And some clients may not want to do business with you unless you can show proof of insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should strongly consider purchasing business liability insurance if any of the following apply to your business: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a store or office building that’s open to clients, customers, or vendors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly do work on a client’s physical property</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You regularly create advertising or marketing campaigns for your business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You use social media for advertising your business and communicating with customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rent or own commercial property</span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bottom Line</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can save you from some of the most common accidents small businesses face. Suppose a customer is injured at your workplace, or you accidentally damage their property. In that case, business liability insurance will protect you from any medical bills and lawsuits that arise as a result. </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I need liability insurance for my small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most small businesses can benefit from general liability insurance. It is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can protect you financially if you’re ever involved in a lawsuit or if a customer is injured on your property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you operate an office or storefront that’s open to customers, work on a customer’s property, or own commercial property, you should probably purchase small business liability insurance. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does general liability insurance cover for a small business?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General liability insurance covers claims related to the following incidents:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bodily injury:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A customer has an accident or is injured on your business premises.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Property damage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You accidentally damage a customer’s property during business operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Copyright infringement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’re accused of stealing another company’s ideas and using them in a marketing or advertising campaign.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reputation harm: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re accused of slandering another company, and it damages their business.</span></li>
</ul>
