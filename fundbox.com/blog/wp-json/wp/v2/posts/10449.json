Your first client, your first dollar, your first day at work are all pivotal moments for your career. Though you may be operating from a single desk in a one-room office, you still imagine the future when your business is booming, employees are bustling, and you have more work than you can handle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, many businesses never reach that point. In fact, only about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/advocacy\/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2018.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80% of small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> survive their first year of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve built a strong foundation and emerged from your first few years with a thriving business\u2014congratulations!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you\u2019re looking to expand your business and you\u2019re wondering what\u2019s next. First, a word of caution: Expanding your business too soon or too aggressively can be devastating, especially to a construction company. The good news is you can avoid many common pitfalls with some careful planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through deciding when to expand your construction business, and how to prepare for expansion when you\u2019re ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 Signs You\u2019re Ready to Expand Your Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you go too far with the process, it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re actually ready to expand your construction business. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is expanding before you\u2019re ready. If you scale too soon, you will tap out your resources, potentially leaving yourself cash-strapped and stretched too thin. Here are the most important things to consider before you make the jump:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. You Have Plenty of Work<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When businesses consider expansion, it\u2019s usually for one of two reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They have more work than their resources can handle, or<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They don\u2019t have enough work and hope that expanding into new markets will fix this problem.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, only the first type of businesses survive an expansion. While a new service or territory may be the answer for a small percentage of companies who are lacking sales, it\u2019s rarely the best solution to the problem. In this case, it\u2019s better to reconsider your marketing efforts, customer service, and other potential problems before considering expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your phones are constantly ringing and contracts are coming in quicker than you can count, however, you\u2019re likely ready to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your Clients Are Happy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obviously, you also want happy customers. If you have plenty of repeat customers or word-of-mouth is your primary marketing strategy, then proceed to the next point. If not, you might evaluate the situation and make sure your current customers are completely satisfied before considering expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. You Have More Money Than Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are checks coming in promptly? Are you meeting payroll without any issues? Are you able to pay yourself a salary? Then you probably don\u2019t have a lot of time on your hands, and that\u2019s okay. In fact, that\u2019s a sure sign that it\u2019s time to consider expanding your business. If nothing else, you need another set of hands to handle some of the tasks, giving yourself room to breathe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Opportunities for Expansion Arise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe your customers are requesting services that you don\u2019t offer yet. Maybe clients are requesting bids or estimates for jobs outside your current territory. Maybe someone is selling their business, and you\u2019re thinking it would be a great complement to your current services. These are all viable opportunities for expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blog_7.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15850 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blog_7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1240\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blog_7.png 1240w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blog_7-768x476.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step-by-Step Expansion Budgeting Process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019ve decided expansion is the answer, it\u2019s time to start the process. But first, it\u2019s time to make a budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s Your Plan for Expanding Your Business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are different types of expansions, and it\u2019s important to consider all the different facets of your own plan. Depending on how you plan to expand, you\u2019ll need to focus on different expenses and other considerations. For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you planning to acquire another company? If so, you will need to consider real estate closing costs, office and warehouse expenses (including rent and utilities), and additional employee salaries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want to add a few more services to your existing business? If that\u2019s the case, your budget may be simpler. You will need to consider things like the materials and labor required to offer those services, as well as any possible overhead expense increases.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you planning to bid more jobs? This plan might require more employees. Consider all of the costs associated with those employees, and what they will need to take on more work. You may need to purchase more equipment, more materials, and more tools.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s time to get it all down on paper. Start with the overall goal of your expansion, then start listing the steps you will need to take to achieve that goal. Don\u2019t forget small things like acquiring permits and business licenses for new territories, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estimate Your Budget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estimating your budget seems like a huge task, but it\u2019s quite simple when you break it down into smaller steps. You already have the overall plan for your expansion, so now it\u2019s time to dig into the numbers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need help getting started, take a blank business <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-free-small-business-budget-templates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budget template<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and fill in the data using your current financial information. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a strong starting point for a budget that reflects your current financial situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, using your expansion outline created above, fill in another budget template with your projected costs after the expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may need to do some research to estimate these numbers. For example, if you will need a new office for your expansion, search for available properties in the area to find a good estimate for rent. You may want to work with your bookkeeper or accountant on this planning exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, your goal here is to make sure you remember every possible new expense post-expansion. Common expenses include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee salaries and benefits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Land and\/or real estate<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acquisition costs if you\u2019re buying another company<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Materials, tools, and equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing and advertising<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transportation and lodging if you\u2019re expanding your service area<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have estimated expenses outlined, you should also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/career-development\/formula-for-sales-forecast\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimate your future sales.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give yourself a \u201cbest case scenario\u201d estimate and a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d estimate. You may want to fill out several different budget sheets to explore different possible outcomes. You can use these numbers to see when your expansion plan will start turning a profit and how much of a profit you can expect.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, using the range of numbers determined from your budget estimates, you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research business financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, apply for the financing you need, and finalize the next steps of your expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding your business is seldom easy, but growth is almost inevitable for any strong business model. If you walk through these steps one by one and aren\u2019t afraid of research, you can start your expansion with a strong budget and the funds you need to get the job done quickly. Then you can get back to what you do best: running your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
