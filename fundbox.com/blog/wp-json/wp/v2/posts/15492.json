This can be a challenging game for companies to play if they need to get their hands on some cash fast. Giving your customers time to pay their bills can make their lives a whole lot easier and may be the only way they can afford to make purchases from you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s understandable why your customers may need to wait on their cash flow to pick up to pay their bills, your business may have the same need. Two potential solutions to cash flow problems caused by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/when-should-you-send-your-invoices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">waiting for invoices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be paid are bill discounting and invoice discounting. Let\u2019s look at how these two processes vary, how much they cost, and the benefits and downsides of each solution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is bill discounting?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with bill discounting. Bill discounting offers a solution to unpaid invoices that are scheduled to be paid in the future. Essentially, the process of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.m1xchange.com\/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bill discounting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entails selling unpaid invoices to a financier who will then pursue payment. When the company sells their unpaid invoices to a financier, they do so by offering them a discount. The point of doing this is to gain access to short-term financial assistance. This can be really helpful if your company is in need of working capital and wants to speed up your cash flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at a bill discounting example. If Business A sold $100,000 worth of goods to Business B on credit, Business B will be issued an invoice they will have to pay at some point. If Business A is confident that Business B will pay their invoice but needs to access the cash from that sale sooner, they can sell that invoice to a company that provides bill discounting services. If Company A agrees to give a 15% discount to the bill discounting provider, they will be given $97,500. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.m1xchange.com\/bill-discounting.php#:~:text=Bill%20Discounting%20is%20a%20trade,bank%20or%20another%20financial%20institution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much a company will have to pay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> varies greatly depending on factors like the businesses\u2019 financial history, the applicant\u2019s credit score, and how stable the business is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While bill discounting will lead to earning less, which can be frustrating, if a business really needs cash to fund a business expenditure, order more inventory, or pay their employees, they may find bill discounting is worth the slight loss. These are a few of the benefits of bill discounting.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep cash flowing\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gain fast access to cash in as little as 24 hours<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No collateral required<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill discounting is not a loan, and no debt is incurred<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The balance sheet is not impacted as this is an off-the-book process<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is invoice discounting?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next is invoice discounting. It\u2019s very easy to confuse bill discounting and invoice discounting since the terms sound so similar and help solve the same problem, but these are two very different processes. This is primarily because <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingtools.com\/articles\/what-is-invoice-discounting.html#:~:text=Invoice%20discounting%20is%20the%20practice,issued%20by%20a%20finance%20company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice discounting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses unpaid invoices to act as collateral for a loan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These loans are relatively short-term because the company can pay them back as soon as the invoice is paid. After going through invoice discounting, the company will receive a loan that is smaller than the amount of the outstanding invoices (usually 80% or any invoices that are less than 90 days old). Generally, the company financing the loan gives out loans based on the total percentage of invoices owed in order to spread out their liability. That way even if all the invoices aren\u2019t paid, the company taking out the loan can still pay back their debt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to bill discounting, invoice discounting provides a solution for companies looking to speed up their cash flow while they wait for their customers to pay their invoices. The company financing the invoice discounting generally charges interest on the loan and a monthly fee.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice discounting is typically a better fit for companies that have high profit margins that can help them cover the interest payments associated with invoice discounting. If a business has low profit margins, they may find this type of financing makes it hard for them to earn a profit. Typically, businesses pursue invoice discounting as a last resort because facing both interest payments and fees isn\u2019t super appealing, and many only turn to invoice discounting if they can\u2019t secure another form of financing.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice Factoring<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we compare and contrast the differences between bill discounting and invoice discounting, let\u2019s take a quick look at what <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/invoice-factoring\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is as many businesses consider this financing solution when they need to gain access to cash flow quickly. Invoice factoring and invoice discounting are two different processes, despite their very similar names. Invoice factoring is a type of invoice financing that allows companies to sell their unpaid invoices to a factoring company. The factoring company then pursues payment directly from the customers who owe the business money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though both bill discounting and factoring provide similar short-term financing solutions,\u00a0 bill discounting acts as an advance of sorts against a bill owed. Invoice factoring on the other hand, involves the outright purchase of trade debt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may\u00a0 lose quite a bit of cash when utilizing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/business-financing-options\/invoice-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, at a rate of about 60% to 95% of the total invoice value. Invoice factoring may be a better option for companies whose clients are overdue on their invoice payments and who don\u2019t have time to track down late payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between bill and invoice discounting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure whether bill discounting or invoicing is a better fit for your business? Let\u2019s take a look at how the two options compare.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.herofincorp.com\/blog\/what-bill-or-invoice-discounting#:~:text=Difference%20between%20Bill%20%26%20Invoice%20Discounting&amp;text=While%20invoice%20discounting%20is%20meant,30%20days%20to%20120%20days\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bill discounting and invoice discounting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> serve a similar purpose for businesses. Each of these options give businesses a way to get their hands on the funds they\u2019re waiting for after issuing invoices to their customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some key differences between these two financing options. Invoice discounting is a loan, whereas bill discounting acts as a bill of exchange. When you pursue invoice discounting, you can only do so for unpaid invoices that will be paid in 90 days, whereas bill discounting offers more flexibility and can work for bills due anywhere from 30 to 120 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what financing option a company pursues, they\u2019ll want to make sure they shop around to see which financing companies can offer them the lowest interest rates and fees. This is an important step that can help save businesses a lot of money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Fundbox Can Help<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While both bill discounting and invoice discounting can provide solutions for business owners that need cash fast, neither of these options may be the best option for your business. If you\u2019re looking for ongoing flexible financing options, a revolving line of credit may be a better fit for your business. A business line of credit can help businesses\u00a0 cover more than just slow or late invoice payments and can step in when sales are slow or unplanned expenses arise. Having access to a business line of credit can make it easier to get through a rough patch\u2014and can be what helps your business survive.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox offers a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you can pay back in equal installments over the course of a 12 or 24 week plan. You won\u2019t face any penalties for repaying early and each time you make a payment, your available credit replenishes, giving you ongoing access to funds should you need them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <section class=\"cta-section\">\n        <h3>\n            Ready for more?\n        <\/h3>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-8 col-xl-9\">\n                <p>Apply for funding and find out if you qualify today<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-xl-3\">\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup?utm_source=fundbox&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=other&utm_content=bill-discounting-invoice-discounting\" class=\"signup-btn\">\n                    Apply Now\n                <\/a>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/section><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes the cost of doing business involves playing the waiting game.
