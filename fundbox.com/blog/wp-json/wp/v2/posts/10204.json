The downturn began over a decade ago, but it\u2019s only within the last few years that the economy has come fully back to life\u2014albeit less so for certain communities, particularly those in rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>But to see how the Great Recession continues to affect us today, just look at the way millennials\u2014America\u2019s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2018\/04\/11\/millennials-largest-generation-us-labor-force\/\">largest generation<\/a><\/span>\u00a0in the U.S. labor force, with some well into their 30s\u2014approach the concept of entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is one of the foundations of the American economy, if not a central part of the collective American psyche. And yet, according to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/2019-millennial-entrepreneurs-money-report\">2019 Millennial Entrepreneurs and Money Report<\/a><\/span>\u00a0from the team at Fundera, rates of entrepreneurship for those born in the 1980s and early 1990s is well below other generations, including now retirement-age Baby Boomers.<\/p>\n<p>From the report:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Only <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kauffman.org\/currents\/2016\/07\/age-and-entrepreneurship\">.22% of millennials start new businesses<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0in any given month, compared to .37% of baby boomers. And when baby boomers were younger, they were more likely to become entrepreneurs than millennials are today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Millennials are lagging behind older generations in terms of their willingness to start a business, and even trail post-millennials in terms of business revenue and much of it has to do with coming of age during the economy\u2019s greatest contraction in the post-World War II era.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Millennials have lower personal credit scores than previous generations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The average personal credit score for millennials is 699\u2014more than 20 points lower than that of Baby Boomers. This may be due to the fact that millennials carry, on average, just as much debt as older generations do, despite having had less time to rack up that debt.

Without that access to capital, millennials are likely reticent to take on the risk of starting their own business.<\/p>\n<p>And although some millennials are undoubtedly unwise with their money\u2014as are we all\u2014evidence points to them actually being more astute financial planners than previous generations: Their business credit scores are markedly higher than those of people from Generation X (whom they beat by almost 40 points) and Baby Boomers (23 points).<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Millennials\u2019 \u201cdo-it-myself\u201d mentality may not lend itself to entrepreneurship <\/span><\/h2>\n<p>According to a recent <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/olui2.fs.ml.com\/Publish\/Content\/application\/pdf\/GWMOL\/Merrill_Edge_Report_Fall_2017.pdf\">Merrill Edge report<\/a><\/span>, millennials tend to want to take their financial matters into their own hands, not relying on others as they pursue financial independence.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that wanting to \u201cDIY\u201d everything would make millennials more interested in starting their own businesses, not less. But their concern with long-term financial stability makes them less likely to take on the risk and debt that a startup loan\u2014be it from a bank, online lender, or even friends and family\u2014would require.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Millennials are taking conservative approaches with their finances<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Undoubtedly scarred by seeing how risk can backfire after the bubbles burst in 2007 and 2008, millennials are taking slow, deliberate approaches to building up both their personal finances and their businesses.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Millennial Report, millennials\u2019 businesses are being outperformed from a revenue standpoint by businesses from every other generation, including post-millennials. That\u2019s because many millennials have been on an uphill climb since they graduated from school, and as a result they are more conservative and tend to \u201cplay it safe.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10209\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10209\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10209\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Fundera-report-recession-memories.png\" alt=\"When it comes to business revenues, millennials are not at the top of the pack.

Some people lost their businesses, others lost their personal savings, and some lost everything. At that point, millennials, many of whom were still coming of age or in school, had less to lose.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the stock market and economy at-large has mostly recovered, however, it appears that millennials lost things that they may never gain back. The recession hit at a crucial time for building personal credit, capital, and opportunity\u2014and millennials may spend the rest of their lives playing catch up. The fact that so many are choosing the security of salaried positions over the risk of starting a business should come as little surprise.<\/p>\n<p>The entrepreneurs that do emerge from this generation are more resilient and assured than they have any right to be, and our report shows exactly why. We look forward to checking back with them in a few years to see which of these trends are temporary dips, and which trends are\u2014for better or for worse\u2014for life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Great Recession is still in our rear view mirror.
