Business owners in every industry are either <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/coronavirus-business-pivoting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pivoting their offerings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/moving-business-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migrating online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014and they need smart marketing and advertising strategies to stay relevant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s where your company comes in. Here are five tactics you can use to grow your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/helping-underserved-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing or advertising agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Highlight your core offering<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promoting your agency\u2019s core service offering is a good way to stand out and attract new clients. Plus, narrowing your focus can free you up to accept more work. After all, when your team doesn\u2019t have to switch strategies for each project, you can tighten your workflow and reuse the same methods of measurement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify your agency\u2019s strengths, start by reviewing your portfolio, project analytics, and financials. Which service accounts for the majority of your work? Which one generates the most revenue? Which verticals do you have the most experience and success in?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you pinpoint your specialty\u2014whether it\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, video marketing, or branding\u2014work on promoting it. You could:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redesign your website\u2019s landing page to feature an example of your core service offering.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add your specialty to your social media bios and posts.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Update your company description on local and industry business directories.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> campaign to highlight your core service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Include your specialty on Google Ads.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Expand your content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your agency\u2019s growth depends on you prioritizing internal marketing and advertising\u2014even when you have a full plate of client projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good place to start is with your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">content marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> efforts. Take an inventory of your website to see what might be missing. If you don\u2019t feature case studies, for example, consider building a section to highlight client successes and show off your team\u2019s work. Case studies have a high success rate for converting leads (second only to in-person events), according to the B2B marketers surveyed in the Content Marketing Institute\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B2B 2020 report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog posts, on the other hand, are a smart way to build brand awareness and show prospective clients you know what you\u2019re talking about. Say your target clientele is fitness and nutrition companies, for example. You could write a series of posts speaking to their pain points, discussing fitness and nutrition industry trends, or offering B2C marketing tips. One creative agency, Masterworks Creative, turned their equestrian hobby experience into a bonanza for niche marketing to the equine industry.

Productize your services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transforming your agency\u2019s services into products accomplishes two goals: 1) It helps you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract and serve a wider range of clients<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 2) provides a source of passive revenue. Plus, offering products at a lower price point than your services is a great way to appeal to clients who have a smaller marketing budget but still want expert guidance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you specialize in graphic design, for example, you could develop an online course that explains how to create the most compelling graphics for every social media platform. If your expertise lies in SEO, consider writing an ebook that shares secrets for optimizing every type of content\u2014from article headlines to social media posts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Improve company efficiency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streamlining your workflow can give you more time to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/turn-warm-prospects-hot-clients\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nurture leads<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and create proposals, both of which are essential to growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To figure out where you can improve, review your agency\u2019s projected and actual project timelines, then ask your team which tasks or workflow stages they struggle with most. You may discover you need fewer meetings, more detailed client briefs, better communication between team members, or a completely different approach to projects.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the following time-saving strategies as part of your plan:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsource content creation to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freelance writers, illustrators, or graphic designers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use software to automate tedious tasks or increase productivity. There are apps that can facilitate project management, help employees track their hours, and even block your calendar to let you focus on completing important tasks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule one weekly team meeting to set goals and measure progress.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Invest in thought leadership<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasing your agency\u2019s thought leadership footprint is a long-term investment in your success. Not only will you gain exposure and reach new clientele, you\u2019ll also establish yourself as an authority on specific subjects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you choose someone to represent the brand, look for opportunities to contribute to both topical and evergreen conversations in a meaningful way. That can include everything from writing a book to leading a conference panel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a handful of strategies to try:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for newsletters like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HARO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProfNet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to connect with journalists who need marketing and advertising sources.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pen an article on Medium or LinkedIn.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pitch yourself to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">podcast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hosts looking for guests.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contribute guest blog posts to resource sites or business blogs.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up to speak at an online conference.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Host a live webinar.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-growth-on-budget\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your marketing or advertising agency, you have to treat your company as your most important client.
