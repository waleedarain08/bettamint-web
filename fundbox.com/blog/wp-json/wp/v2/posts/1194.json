So it\u2019s not surprising that small business employers aren\u2019t exactly tuned into the insurance needs of their employees or are even familiar with the benefits that they could offer outside core health insurance.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when surveyed by insurance\u00a0carrier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coloniallife.com\/employers\/small-employers.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Colonial Life<\/a>, 47% of small business employees responded that they value non-medical insurance benefits almost twice as much as their employers believe they do. And 40-49% of small business employees are interested in purchasing additional insurance benefits, such as life, disability, and critical illness\u00a0if they have access.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, there\u2019s a huge gap between what employers think and what employees value.<\/p>\n<p>So how do small business employers go about attracting and retaining talent\u00a0if their benefit packages are apparently short of employee expectations and needs?<\/p>\n<p>This is where voluntary benefits can help. Let\u2019s explore what voluntary benefits are and how they work:<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are Voluntary Benefits?<\/strong><br \/>\nVoluntary benefits allow employers and employees to fill the gaps they have in their existing benefits packages \u2013 and include options for life insurance, short-term disability, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Employees can buy these insurance products through their employers at a lower rate than they could get on their own \u2013 at no cost to the employer. Employees also gain the flexibility of picking and choosing the benefits they want based on their needs and budget.<\/p>\n<p>Products range from identity theft coverage to pet insurance, although most are designed to address critical life needs and provide a financial safety net \u2013 popular benefits include short-term disability, accidental coverage, and life insurance.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these benefits can be also help reduce payroll taxes.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>NOTE<\/em><\/strong>: <em>Primary health care insurance is NOT a voluntary benefit. Employees can use the government\u2019s <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SHOP Marketplace<\/em><\/a><em> to find low-cost health insurance coverage for employees. Voluntary benefits are instead offered as an option to help employees provide more robust and attractive benefits packages, over and above traditional healthcare plans.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How Can Voluntary Benefits Help?<\/strong><br \/>\nGroup rates, payroll deduction, and potential portability make voluntary benefits affordable and attractive to employers and their workers alike. They also give employers an opportunity to strengthen existing benefit packages at little or no extra cost while reducing the high out-of-pocket costs of providing regular or group plans.<\/p>\n<p>Another bonus for employers is convenience. Insurance carriers can take the burden of employee education (counseling sessions that help employees make informed decisions about the right plans for their needs), enrollment and administration off the employer\u2019s plate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do Voluntary Benefits Cost Employers?<\/strong><br \/>\nVoluntary benefits are usually employee paid. There is no cost to the employer.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works. As a small business owner, you provide a direct conduit between an insurance carrier and your employees. You already know your employees are interested in beefing up their existing benefits package; the carrier simply steps in and takes it from there. Interested employees spend time with the carrier\u2019s benefits counselor to review their current coverage and their future needs (and potentially purchase a plan) \u2013 at no cost to you.<\/p>\n<p>Insurance providers may also ask that you keep an eye on the needs of employees over time and gauge where there are gaps in coverage so that they can propose plans that might fit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to Look for in a Voluntary Benefits Partner<\/strong><br \/>\nPutting something as important as benefits administration and the goodwill and hard-earned money of your employees in the rights hands requires a partnership. Look for a provider who has experience working with small businesses \u2013 there\u2019s a world of difference between a company with 10, 20 or 50 employees than one with 500. Also, consider a provider who knows your industry or works with similar small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Ask about their approach. Will they take time to learn your benefits communication and enrollment goals? How closely will they work with you to deliver on employee education promises and plan administration tasks? In a nutshell, they should be able to demonstrate how they\u2019re going to make your life easier. All these services, the initial consultation, should be offered at no cost.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to check that they can dig into employee and dependent information to confirm eligibility for the types of benefits you want to offer\u00a0before you sign up for them.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, check to see whether they offer a full portfolio of offerings. Right now you might only be interested in life insurance but down the line you may want to add short-term disability or other benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do Voluntary Benefits fit in with the Affordable Care Act?<\/strong><br \/>\nVoluntary benefits fall outside the scope of the ACA (aka Obamacare). Instead, they are private products offered directly by insurance carriers and aren\u2019t available for purchase on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/families\/\" target=\"_blank\">Healthcare Exchanges<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/what-is-the-shop-marketplace\/\" target=\"_blank\">SHOP<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn More<\/strong><br \/>\nTo learn more about voluntary benefits, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ocuDRZ5oJ7o\" target=\"_blank\">on-demand webinar<\/a> from Colonial Life in partnership with the SBA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related Blog Posts<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/employee-perks-is-it-worth-the-cost-to-start-an-incentive-program-in-the-workplace\/\" target=\"_blank\">Employee Perks: Is It Worth the Cost to Start an Incentive Program in the Workplace?<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Small business owners wear many hats\u00a0and simply finding the time to research and manage employee benefits isn\u2019t easy.
