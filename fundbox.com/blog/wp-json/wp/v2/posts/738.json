But for accountants and CPAs, it\u2019s a double-edged sword.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud accounting software firms have used cloud technology to penetrate deep into the profits of accounting firms by putting tax preparation, cash flow management, accounting, and payroll into the hands of clients. This in turn diminishes the control that accountants have over their core services and their most precious assets \u2013 client relationships.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s good news, the cloud can actually change that equation and help accountants refocus their practices on accountant-centric solutions and cut costs while significantly growing their bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h2><b>Offload your IT infrastructure to the Cloud<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Struggling to keep up local servers and PCs? Fed up shuffling emails back and forth and maintaining accurate versions of client files? Replacing your IT infrastructure with a secure, fully managed, cloud-based alternative is worth consideration.<\/p>\n<p>The cloud eliminates the need for in-house technology infrastructure such as servers and software to buy, run and maintain.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>What can I\u00a0move to the cloud?<\/i><\/b>\u00a0Almost everything. A good place to start is with accounting software or office productivity tools. For example, you can ditch your\u00a0Microsoft Office and Exchange platforms in favor of Office 365 or Google Apps for Business. The cloud is also a secure repository for document management and data storage (great for disaster recovery purposes). Alternatively, you can outsource your entire infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>What about the cost?<\/i><\/b> Instead of paying expensive license fees, cloud providers charge users based on a pay-as-you-go or usage model. And, because everything is managed, maintained, and upgraded by your cloud provider, you can eliminate hardware and maintenance costs.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>What cloud services should we consider?<\/i><\/b> Many <a href=\"https:\/\/tridenstechnology.com\/cloud-versus-on-premise-billing-solutions\/\">cloud billing software<\/a> solutions are designed with accounting firms in mind. <a href=\"http:\/\/xcentric.com\/cloud\/\">Xcentric Cloud<\/a>, for example, allows firms to outsource business applications, store data, or offload their entire IT functions to a secure-cloud based solution.

Accounting has increasingly become dominated by DIY solutions, which put clients in the driving seat, not accountants.
