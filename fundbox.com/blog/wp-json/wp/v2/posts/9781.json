To make it easier to separate wheat from chaff, here are four questions to ask yourself before deciding whether to take on a new project.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Does the project enhance my portfolio?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are two ways you can enhance your portfolio: Through association or the type of work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Enhancement through association: <\/span>Have you ever visited a website that says \u201cAs seen in [insert publication]?\u201d Sure you have. Clients and projects that can give you this social proof may be worth working for.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Enhancement by type of work: <\/span>You likely specialize in a service or a range of services. By tackling client work that\u2019s related to your core service you enhance your portfolio and demonstrate you can deliver on that service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Will I be able to charge what I\u2019m worth?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many business owners make the mistake of jumping all over new projects without truly understanding how much time it will take them to complete it.<\/p>\n<p>So, get clear on how much time you\u2019ll spend on the project by defining the scope of work. Then, once you understand what the work entails, ask yourself: Is the money I\u2019m <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/billing-blind-spots\">getting worth<\/a><\/span>\u00a0the time?<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Is there long-term potential?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many small business owners undersell themselves just to get a foot in the door. They agree to work at a reduced rate (and in some cases even for free) especially if it\u2019s their dream client.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter how reputable you believe the client to be; you should always evaluate the long-term potential of a project:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there potential for more work?<\/li>\n<li>Is this a once off or will there be recurring projects?<\/li>\n<li>If this is a once off, will it benefit me?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One-off projects can benefit you when you\u2019re starting your business and need social proof. But constantly relying on them means you\u2019ll always have to hustle for new business which can cause cash flow problems.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s wise to get a few <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/3-ways-to-find-and-land-anchor-clients\">anchor clients<\/a><\/span>\u00a0who can guarantee you a certain amount of income each month.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. What is my gut telling me?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Have you ever felt:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncomfortable promoting a specific brand (maybe you don\u2019t believe in the brand, or their values clash with yours)?<\/li>\n<li>Apprehensive about the type of work the client wants you to do?<\/li>\n<li>Uneasy when talking to a specific client (you can\u2019t quite put your finger on it, but something doesn\u2019t feel right?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is your gut talking. Everyone will have different gut feelings, but it\u2019s important that you tune into your gut when tackling any new project. Your gut is a powerful thing and in my experience rarely wrong.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s often tempting to say yes to every project that comes your way, especially if the money is good. The truth is that not every project is worth pursuing.<\/p>\n<p>But, by asking these four questions and being more selective with the projects you undertake you can avoid these situations.<\/p>\n<p>Have you worked on a project that turned out to be a nightmare?
