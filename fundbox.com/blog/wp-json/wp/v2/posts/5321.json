That\u2019s the good news.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, more employer businesses shut down than start up each month.<\/p>\n<p>In honor of Independence Day, we&#8217;re focusing on how to make the leap to self-employment. Whether you\u2019re looking to start a business right out of college or ready to make the move from a nine-to-five job, here are some tips and considerations for getting started.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Assess your personal readiness<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As satisfying and rewarding as business ownership can be, it\u2019s hard work and takes a certain type of character to succeed. The biggest thing you\u2019ll notice is that the buck stops with you and the hats you\u2019ll wear are many: salesperson, accountant, marketer, IT support, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Give it some careful thought. One way to break into business is to start out as a freelancer or consultant. Ask yourself these <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/want-go-freelance-year-ask-7-questions-first\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seven questions<\/a> to gauge whether this could be the right approach.<\/p>\n<p>The SBA also offers a number of resources that can help you assess your readiness, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/how-start-business\/20-questions-starting\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20 Questions to Ask Before Starting a Business<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/how-start-business\/entrepreneurship-you\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Is Entrepreneurship Right for You?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Check out organizations like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.score.org\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SCORE<\/a> and your local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/tools\/local-assistance\/sbdc\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small Business Development Center<\/a> (SBSC). They can both help you prepare yourself.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Understand the costs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Can you even afford to start a business? Will you need financing to get you started? How much will you need? Calculating the cost of starting your business will help provide answers.<\/p>\n<p>Startup costs fall into two buckets: expenses and assets. <strong><em>Expenses<\/em><\/strong> are incurred during the startup phase and include everything from office supplies to paying a designer to help you build your website.\u00a0 These costs are also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed\/Deducting-Business-Expenses\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tax-deductible<\/a>.\u00a0 You can also throw in the cost of incorporating your business and other associated legal fees.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Assets<\/em><\/strong> are one-time costs, such as buying inventory, vehicles, property, etc. and, unfortunately, don\u2019t typically qualify for a tax deduction, although some can be depreciated.<\/p>\n<p>Take time to define your expenses and asset costs. For many businesses, especially home-based businesses and freelancers, these might be quite low. Don\u2019t forget your living expenses too. Create a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow forecast<\/a> so you can see when how the flow of cash in and out of your business will impact your cash situation for the next 12 months. Incorporate the results into your business plan and address how these costs will be recouped.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Have a series of mini plans for your business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Everyone needs a plan. The good news is that it doesn\u2019t need to be encyclopedic.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on the \u201cplanning\u201d steps, and not the \u201cplan\u201d itself. Review your overall business goals and then think about how each function of your business can help achieve those goals. For this you\u2019ll need mini-plans: one for marketing, one for IT, one for operations, one for sales, one for staffing, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>If you have plans for growth overseas or into a new market, you\u2019ll need a separate plan for that too. Set a budget, goals, and measurables for each mini-plan and revisit them once every week or two. Breaking your plans down into smaller chunks will help keep things manageable and keep you from feeling overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get savvy about taxes and regulations<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Business ownership comes with a legion of regulatory and legal responsibilities. Here are some of the things you&#8217;ll need to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/choose-register-your-business\/register-your-business-name\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registering your business name<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Incorporation (or not)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forming a partnership<\/a> (see also <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Split Profits in a Business Partnership<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Applying for the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/business-licenses-permits\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">licenses and permits<\/a> (even home-based businesses need these)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/filing-paying-taxes\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registering with tax authorities<\/a> (state, local and the IRS)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/starting-business\/hire-retain-employees\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Employment law<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Paying <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-manage-your-estimated-tax-payments-without-eroding-cash-flow\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated taxes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/the-trademark-name-game\/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Intellectual property<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Contracts<\/li>\n<li>Business insurance (not the law, but highly recommended)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s a lot to take in.

Consult an accountant and tax preparer. That first consult is often free and can be very valuable, especially when you&#8217;re just getting started.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Build your entrepreneurial support system<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Other business owners, mentors, and online communities are just some of the many sources of support for entrepreneurs. They can help you deal with your questions, challenges, and anxieties.

But do your legwork\u2014plan, prepare, consult, and educate yourself. Even if you\u2019ve done your research and know that there\u2019s a market screaming out for your products or services, don\u2019t neglect the backbone of your business: you. Get to know your obligations, needs, and aptitude before you make the leap.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Entrepreneurialism is part of the American dream, and let\u2019s face it, owning a small business is the best kind of &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":12281,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[723,719,5130,1132,3836,740,2177,7070,3037,7069,1112,763,3050,5540,3511,712,4522,1625,1716,772],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-left-curve","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Celebrate Your Independence: How to Make the Move to Self-Employment | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Entrepreneurialism is part of the American dream, and let\u2019s face it, self-employment is the best kind of independence there is."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Celebrate Your Independence: How to Make the Move to Self-Employment | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Entrepreneurialism is part of the American dream, and let\u2019s face it, self-employment is the best kind of independence there is."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/celebrate-your-independence-self-employment\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/shutterstock_637344349.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/shutterstock_637344349.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Entrepreneurialism is part of the American dream, and let\u2019s face it, self-employment is the best kind of independence there is."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Celebrate Your Independence: How to Make the Move to Self-Employment | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/shutterstock_637344349.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/celebrate-your-independence-self-employment\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5321"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5321"}],"version-history":[{"count":18,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5321\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16184,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5321\/revisions\/16184"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/12281"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5321"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5321"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5321"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=5321"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
