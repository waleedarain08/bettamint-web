Consider starting then growing a computer systems design company. Computer systems design is a broad industry that encompasses a wide range of activities, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Designing and testing software<\/li>\n<li>Installing software<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining and managing clients&#8217; computer systems<\/li>\n<li>Providing hardware and software consulting<\/li>\n<li>Providing data recovery services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Computer systems design is one of the fastest-growing industries around, and it\u2019s projected to grow 21 percent by 2014, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/datausa.io\/profile\/soc\/151121\/#intro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a>. It&#8217;s easy to see why this industry is so promising. Trends including the growth of cloud computing and software as a service, the importance of IT to any business\u2019 success, the rise of mobile technology, and the emergence of artificial intelligence and virtual reality technology are creating exciting new opportunities in the field. To take advantage of these new technologies, businesses of all sizes need help from IT experts to design, install, manage, and maintain their computer systems.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Considerations When Starting a Computer Systems Design Company<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When starting a\u00a0computer systems design company, you&#8217;ll need to ask yourself these key questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What services will you offer<\/strong>? Because this industry encompasses so many different services, it&#8217;s important to be clear about exactly what your business will provide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What is your target market<\/strong>? Generally, a computer systems design company\u00a0serves clients\u00a0that don\u2019t have their own internal IT departments. This can range from small or even home-based businesses to multinational corporations. You will need to do some market research to determine the best target market for you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How will you specialize<\/strong>? Computer systems design companies work with a wide variety of businesses. Some of the most common include healthcare, financial services, and government organizations. Because different industries have their own unique technology needs as well as regulations to follow in terms of protecting sensitive data, specializing in one industry can help you convince clients your business is the best suited to solve their IT problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How will you provide and price your services<\/strong>? You can provide hourly assistance (this works well for short-term problems or emergencies), work on a retainer basis (providing a set amount of services each month), or work on a per-project basis. Many computer systems design companies offer all these pricing structures to suit different clients\u2019 needs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Where will you locate your business<\/strong>? You&#8217;ll want to be close to lots of potential clients, which generally means in or near urban centers. It\u2019s also important to have access to a steady supply of qualified employees. Although you can do much of the work using virtual employees, many clients prefer you and your employees onsite at least part of the time. Computer systems analysts typically have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a similar field, so locations near universities can be helpful.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>growing a computer systems design company<\/h2>\n<p>Once your business is up and running, the following tips will help it grow:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Hire carefully<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In addition to computing skills, employees also need the ability to communicate effectively with a wide variety of clients, the ability to multitask and manage priorities, and an understanding of how technology fits into a business\u2019s overall goals.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Focus on marketing<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your business website is your key marketing piece. However, you also need a strong presence on LinkedIn to network with potential customers. Building personal relationships is key to successfully growing a computer systems design company.

The average salary for computer systems analysts is more than $80,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You\u2019ll also need specialized insurance to protect your business against claims of negligence or errors. Large clients, such as corporations and government agencies, are often slow to pay.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Make sure you have a plan for how you\u2019ll get over cash flow shortages and finance future growth.
