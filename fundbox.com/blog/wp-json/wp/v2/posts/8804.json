While there is still time left to prepare and file, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) has many small business owners wondering what impact tax reform will have on their returns.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to book some time with your tax advisor or CPA now so you can understand the implications on your deductions, tax rate, and even your choice of business structure going forward.<\/p>\n<p>While we know an article could never replace a consultation with your own tax advisor, there are some things almost every business owner will probably need to consider. As you prepare for this uniquely challenging tax season, here are seven items to check off your tax checklist.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Know Your Deadlines<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The 2018 tax filing season began on January 29th\u00a0and ends on Tax Day, Tuesday, April 17th. \u00a0The deadline usually falls on the 15th\u00a0but got bumped because it\u2019s a Sunday (and Monday is a holiday in Washington, D.C.).\u00a0If you can\u2019t finish your return on time, make sure you file <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f4868.pdf\">Form 4868<\/a><\/span>\u00a0by April 17th, 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Consult your tax preparer to see what their time frame is for a timely filing and when you need to hand over documentation and records.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Contribute to Your Retirement Account<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s still time to contribute to your IRA or Roth IRA. Making a deductible contribution by April 17th\u00a0will lower your tax bill this year and any contributions will compound tax-deferred. For the 2017 tax year, the maximum IRA contribution is $5,500 or $6,500 if you\u2019re 50 or older. If you have a Keogh or SEP you may be eligible for a filing extension of October 15, 2018.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Itemize your Tax Deductions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While the new tax law has increased the standard deduction from $13,000 for joint filers to $24,000 and from $6,500 to $12,500 for single filers, self-employed individuals may save more if they itemize their deductions \u2013 especially if they add up to more than the standard deduction cap. Itemizable deductions include tax preparation fees, business vehicle expenses, professional dues, and medical expenses (if they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income).<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to itemize, make sure each expense is accurately recorded, including the amount paid and a description that shows the amount was for a business expense. For example, if you travel to a client meeting, keep a record of the miles travelled, the reason for the meeting, name of the hotel if you stayed overnight, the date, and any other expenses.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p463\/ch05.html\">Read more here<\/a><\/span>\u00a0about what the IRS considers \u201cdocumentary evidence\u201d to support any expense claims.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to categorize your expenses into buckets such as utilities, office expenses, office supplies, contractors and freelancers, travel and entertainment, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. \u00a0Yes, You Can Still Claim the Home Office Deduction<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s been much confusion about how the TCJA will affect the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\">home office deduction<\/a><\/span>. Good news! If you\u2019re a self-employed business owner, you can still deduct eligible home office expenses against your income. In fact, more business owners now fit the eligibility criteria.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you have no fixed location for your business (think plumbers, paramedics, etc.) you can deduct the home space that you use for managing and administering your business. However, that space must be exclusively used for business (i.e. it can\u2019t be your kitchen table space). Deductible expenses include rent, utilities, and insurance. The IRS<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\">explains<\/a><\/span>\u00a0your options for taking the deduction.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Consider the Impact of Tax Reform on your Business Structure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s always a good idea to talk to your tax advisor about your business structure and whether it is serving you well as your business grows. This year, the TCJA has made it a must-have conversation. \u00a0Whether you\u2019re a sole proprietor, LLC, S corporation, partnership, or other pass-through entity, you may want to review your choice.<\/p>\n<p>For example, pass-through entities can now deduct 20% of any income the business generates, less applicable expenses for single filers (with income &lt; $157,500) and joint filers (income &lt; $315,000). Service trades such as health, law and professional services are excluded if their annual income is over $315,000.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the much-publicized corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% may be something you can claim if you operate an incorporated business (C corporation) but haven\u2019t elected S corporation or operate an LLC and its members have chosen to be taxed as a C corporation.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Spend Some Time with Your Books<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Whether you use a spreadsheet or an accounting program, spend some time making sure all your accounts are up-to-date and that you can account for every line item. Then check that all your deposits add up to your gross revenue. Freelancers need to make sure that these amounts match the 1099s issued by clients.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s never too early to start pulling together all your accounting reports. Being organized early on will make it much easier to complete your return. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profit and loss statement<\/li>\n<li>Balance sheet<\/li>\n<li>Cost of goods sold (including beginning and ending inventory amounts, materials and supplies, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Expenses (marketing, utilities, travel, depreciation, business insurance, office supplies, training costs, home-office expenses, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Any interest earned from savings or checking accounts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read more from the IRS<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep\">on what kind of records you should keep<\/a><\/span>. Good organization can\u2019t be underestimated and can help you out in a big way if the IRS chooses to audit you. Here are some more <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-signs-that-your-small-business-tax-return-may-prompt-an-irs-audit\/\">tips to avoid an IRS audit<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Get Help From a Pro<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already have an accountant, now is the right time to seek one out. Tax reform has made this tax season one that you may not wish to navigate alone. Seek recommendations from friends and peers \u2013 someone who has experience in your industry can be especially helpful.<\/p>\n<p>An accountant who has experience with your tax software is also a plus since most cloud-based accounting software lets you share your records securely online with a tax preparer.<\/p>\n<p><i><small>Disclaimer: The information in this blog doesn\u2019t replace the advice of a tax or legal expert.
