Having worked with and listened to small businesses since our earliest days, we understand that change can be hard, and we\u2019re committed to helping small businesses adapt to a dynamic environment. The good news is that there are a lot of things you can do to stay ready and adapt as you learn new information.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From challenges with remote work to disruptions to your supply chain, small businesses face countless obstacles every day. Financial challenges, however, tend to loom the largest. Not only are business finances a complex, ever-changing entity, but they\u2019re also the engine of any operation. A good financial situation can keep a business running, while too many <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/coping-personal-crisis-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial hardships<\/a> can cause even the most pristine machine to sputter and stall out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few of the top financial challenges facing small businesses when times are uncertain\u2014and how to overcome them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Constrained cash flow<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing cash flow is a perpetual struggle for most business owners. According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guidantfinancial.com\/small-business-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 Small Business Trends report from Guidant Financial<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 33 percent of small business owners surveyed cited a lack of cash flow as their greatest challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is a constant, regardless of the year,\u201d said Ken Wentworth, owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mrbizsolutions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Biz Solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It doesn\u2019t matter how many assets you might have as a business owner. \u201cWithout cash,\u201d Wentworth said, \u201cYou have no business.\u201d Beyond covering major recurring costs like payroll and rent, you also have to pay business taxes, fulfill vendor invoices, and purchase supplies and equipment just to maintain operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>One way to have a reliable source of funding is to apply for a line of credit. Unlike term loans, which provide a lump sum that you use once and repay once (plus interest), a line of credit is \u201crevolving.\u201d This means that you can tap into it repeatedly, when you need it. Then, as soon as you\u2019ve paid back what you borrowed (plus any fee on that amount), those funds are available for you to borrow again in the future, usually without having to reapply for a new loan (although some banks do require customers to reapply periodically to assure they are still creditworthy).<\/p>\n<p>This flexibility makes it very popular for small businesses. A line of credit makes a great, long-lasting solution for short-term cash shortages\u2014like those that sometimes come from delayed receivables, seasonal business slumps, or unexpected economic conditions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/improve-business-cash-flow\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve your cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to experiment with your payment processes. \u201cWork on stretching out when you pay cash for your purchases without being late,\u201d Wentworth said, \u201cand shortening the amount of time it takes to get your invoices paid.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you typically ask clients to pay you in 30 days, for example, consider cutting that window to 15 days. Just make sure you notify your clients and customers of the change before the next payment cycle so they\u2019re not surprised or unprepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-design-invoices-that-get-paid-faster\/\"><b><i>Related: How to Design Invoices That Get Paid Faster<\/i><\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also want to streamline your business\u2019 payment process so clients can pay <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> faster and with less hassle, Wentworth suggested. If you don\u2019t already accept major credit cards, that\u2019s a good place to start, he said. You could also set up an online payment portal or accept payments through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, PayPal, or Apple Pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSending automated payment reminders is another easy-to-implement, yet effective measure you can take,\u201d Wentworth said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have clients or customers who regularly pay late, think about how you can incentivize them to pay sooner, said Matthew Ross, co-owner and COO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rizknows.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RIZKNOWS<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/myslumberyard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Slumber Yard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If \u201cone of your key customers has 40-day payment terms, why not offer a 3 percent discount if they pay within 10 days?\u201d he suggested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is to stretch out when you pay your suppliers. If the invoice says your payment is due in 30 days, pay on day 29, said Wentworth\u2014and do it with a business credit card. \u201cDepending on your billing cycle,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat means you have an additional 30 to 45 days before you have to lay out cash to pay your credit card bill.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you pay off your balance in full each month, though. Carrying a balance and incurring interest on your credit card isn\u2019t advisable, Wentworth added.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Sticking to a budget<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another common business challenge is budgeting. \u201cBudgets are absolutely key to running a clean operation,\u201d said Ross. \u201cBy creating a budget and routinely reviewing actual results versus projections,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou can keep a close eye on expense accounts and make timely cuts when needed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to stick to a budget, though, you have to create one that\u2019s realistic for your business\u2019 goals and profit potential. If this sounds daunting, don\u2019t worry; there are many useful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-free-small-business-budget-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free budget templates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out there to get you started right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To create your budget, begin by looking at all your sources of income to get an idea of how much money you\u2019re working with. Include your sales numbers, investment earnings, and any accounts receivable you have. Next, tally all your fixed expenses, like rent, equipment leases, or loan payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, make a list of expenses that are subject to change from month to month, like contractor wages, marketing, travel, or office supplies. Finally, include enough money to cover emergencies and expensive one-off purchases like equipment or accounting software\u2014we\u2019ll expand on this later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve created annual and quarterly budgets, start scheduling monthly budget reviews to ensure you\u2019re on track. \u201cLet\u2019s say your revenue goal for the month is $100K and you see on the 15th that you are only at $30K,\u201d Wentworth said. Then \u201cyou can motivate your sales team to step up to close the gap during the last two weeks of the month.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building and reviewing a budget regularly creates accountability, he explained, and also helps you make smarter financial decisions throughout the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For detailed guidance on how to create a budget, check out GoodFirm\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodfirms.co\/blog\/best-free-open-source-business-budgeting-software-solutions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blog article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It shows you how to create a budget from scratch using a spreadsheet, and lists some free budgeting tools if spreadsheets aren\u2019t your thing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Marketing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem counterintuitive to spend money on growing your business, but you\u2019ll be well positioned to thrive in the long run if you spend when everyone else cuts their marketing budgets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it is important to be smart about how you invest your money and your time. To stay competitive without draining your cash reserves, you need to get creative. Instead of simply advertising, Ross said, try developing valuable <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO content<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that if you create helpful videos that address related topics in your industry,\u201d you can improve your search ranking <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> attract potential customers looking for similar products or services, Ross explained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about how to improve your SEO rankings, check out Shane Barker\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/small-business-seo-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, loaded with tips and ideas that are straightforward to implement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Keeping cash in reserves<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of small business challenges, Guidant Financial ranks <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guidantfinancial.com\/small-business-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lack of capital on par with a lack of cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s partly because acquiring funding can be difficult. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biz2credit.com\/small-business-lending-index\/may-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biz2Credit\u2019s May 2018 Small Business Lending Index<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, big banks only grant about one in four small business loan applications. Though the approval rating has gone up slowly since the recession, it still is below 30 percent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major limiting factor in approval seems to be tied to business credit. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/insights\/?utm_source=Entrepreneur&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=american_dream_gap_report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nav\u2019s Small Business American Dream Gap Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from 2015, one in five business owners who applied for funding in the last five years were denied, and 82 percent of all the business owners surveyed didn\u2019t know how to interpret their credit scores. The research also showed that individuals who have a better understanding of their business credit score are 41 percent more likely to be approved for a loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to lay out a plan for identifying and improving your business credit score. Then, before you move forward with financing, get clear on how you would use any extra capital and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/business-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check out your options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see what makes the most sense to help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5. Unforeseen expenses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re already busy managing a multitude of recurring business expenses, it\u2019s easy to forget about the costs you can\u2019t easily predict. Think: damaged equipment, finding a new source for inventory, or paying workers to stay home when they\u2019re sick. In a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/accounting\/resources\/small-business-accounting-tips-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 small business accounting survey from Clutch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 35 percent of small business owners cited unforeseen expenses as their main financial challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much money should you allocate for these unforeseen costs? Wentworth said your past records can help you better predict what you might spend. For example, maybe you operate 10 vehicles for your business and need to gear up for potential repair costs. \u201cUse your expense history\u2014if in the prior three years, you spent $600 per vehicle for these types of expenses, then add $6K in your budget for that,\u201d Wentworth suggested.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, no matter how much you pad your budget, occasional <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/prepare-business-disaster\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crises happen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When that\u2019s the case, try to figure out how you can offset that cost and bring your budget back on pace, said Wentworth. Can you ramp up sales for the month, for example? Cancel an upcoming work trip? Unforeseen expenses are inevitable, but the more adept you become at predicting and preparing for them, the more stable your business financials will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Help from government sources<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>On March 27, the government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/covid19-cares-act-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the CARES Act<\/a>.
