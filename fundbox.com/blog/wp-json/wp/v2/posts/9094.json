Even your best customers may be slow to pay due to bureaucracy or other issues. Here are 10 steps you can take to help speed up payment and maintain smoother, more predictable cash flow for your business.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Design your invoices with professional flair<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It might seem like an insignificant detail, but how your invoices look really matters. If your invoices look less than professional, that can reflect on how customers perceive your business.\u00a0Some clients might\u00a0feel they can push your payments to the back of the line.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the design of your invoice can encourage faster payment by directing the recipients&#8217; attention to critical information, such as the amount due and due date, where and how to pay, what the invoice is for, and whom to contact with questions. Keep your invoices\u00a0clear, simple, and uncluttered, and use color to highlight the most important points. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\">One study<\/a><\/span>\u00a0found that saying \u201cPlease\u201d and \u201cThank you\u201d on your invoices can also increase your chances of getting paid. Finally, since that invoice does reflect on your brand and business as a whole, add a professional logo and general contact information so your customer never has to search for it.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Assemble all\u00a0the details<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If some of your clients are big corporations, institutions or government agencies, it&#8217;s possible that your invoices may\u00a0get slowed\u00a0down by\u00a0bureaucracy.<\/p>\n<p>Before creating an invoice, determine the individual, job title, department, email and\/or mailing address it should go to. Also check with that your main client contact person\u00a0to confirm\u00a0what format of invoice they prefer and whether they need the invoice to include specific\u00a0details,\u00a0such as P.O. numbers or your company&#8217;s tax ID number. You can often prevent delays by taking these steps and including these details.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Be straightforward about due dates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Use language that makes your payment expectations clear. For example, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\">research<\/a><\/span>\u00a0has shown that stating, &#8220;Payment due upon receipt&#8221; is less effective than stating a specific due date. &#8220;Net&#8221; can also be confusing; instead of &#8220;Net 30&#8221; it\u00a0can be\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\">better to say<\/a><\/span>\u00a0&#8220;Payment due in 30 days&#8221; or, again, stating a particular date.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Clarify payment terms upfront<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Clients should never be surprised by anything on your invoices. Be sure that deliverables, payment amounts, and payment terms are all agreed upon at the beginning of the project or when the order is placed, and that you have a signed agreement\u00a0confirming this information.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Send your invoices promptly<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The faster you invoice, the faster you will get paid. Assuming the client doesn&#8217;t have specific requirements for how often you invoice \u2014 such as the 15th of each month \u2014 make it a habit to invoice clients immediately upon delivery of your product or service. You can also set up a schedule to invoice every Friday for work delivered that week, or on a schedule that works best for you and your customer.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Accept mobile payments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you regularly deliver products or provide services to customers in their homes or offices, using mobile payment technology can speed payment by allowing you to accept debit and credit card payments immediately. Square\u00a0is one of\u00a0the best-known mobile payment apps, but there are others including Intuit GoPayment\u00a0and PayPal.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Go digital with online invoices and payments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still mailing out paper invoices and waiting for checks to come in, stop. Instead, start invoicing customers online and accepting payments electronically. For example, if you use an accounting system like QuickBooks or FreshBooks, <a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/invoicing\/\">it&#8217;s easy to send <\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/invoicing\/\">online invoices<\/a><\/span>. Many customers actually prefer this method, since it saves them from writing checks and spending money on postage.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/get-paid\">Fundbox Pay<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to request payment from customers online. Fundbox Pay is a smart way to ensure you always get paid on time, while still allowing your clients to take advantage of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/get-paid\">60-day payment terms<\/a><\/span>. It&#8217;s a win-win situation: You can receive funds as early as the next business day, while your customers can wait longer to pay you.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Offer incentives for early payment or charge interest for late payment<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the size of your typical invoice, it may be worth offering customers a percentage off in exchange for early payment. You can also encourage on-time payment by charging interest on late payments. (Before setting interest rates, check your state\u2019s usury laws.) Make sure you include details of incentives and interest rates in the original customer agreement.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">9. Follow up on late paying clients\u00a0quickly<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t wait until payments are 30 days overdue to check with the customer. Create a process for following up the day after payment is due. For example, you can begin with a standard, polite email reminding the customer of the overdue payment, and then follow up with a phone call. Many late payments are simply due to misunderstandings or forgetfulness, and by reaching out to the customer you can often clear things up quickly.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">10. Monitor your cash flow<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Keeping an eye on your cash flow will alert you when funds are running low. That way, you&#8217;ll know when you need to either press your customers for payment, or turn to other financing options. If you have a little bit of extra operating funds in the bank, you\u2019ll be more equipped to handle any delayed payments with grace under pressure.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">There you have it: 10 solid tips for getting paid faster.
