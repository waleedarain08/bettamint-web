It doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m going through a dry spell or thinking about my long-term cash flow, there are certain clients that I know I can\u2019t afford to take on.<\/p>\n<p>After all, if you\u2019re a service-based business owner, the chances are that you are going to spend quite some time with them. Your clients end up having a big impact on your business culture, your work\/life balance, your bottom line, and the direction you take.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s incredibly important that you pair yourself with the right kind of client. It takes time, but the payoff is significant. Here are five client types that I\u2019ve chosen to avoid doing business with, or when I do I put mitigating measures in place to deal with their quirks!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Client with No Clear Plan<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a consultant, 70-80% of the leads I get are from businesses who have no clear idea of their needs. Whether it\u2019s a lack of a business plan, marketing plan, or whatever, they have a vague goal in mind\u00a0but haven\u2019t thought through what it\u2019s going to take to get them there. So they panic, pick up the phone and try to find out what you can do for them. Often they want free advice \u201cwhat will it take for me to do XYZ?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>While there may be an opportunity there, I find that it\u2019s best to be honest, let these clients know what you specialize in, how you\u2019ve helped other companies in similar industries or challenges, and then move on. If they are serious, they\u2019ll call you back, but don\u2019t sweat it. This client doesn\u2019t have any real business for you, yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Client that Flinches During the Money Conversation<\/strong><br \/>\nThis client crosses everyone\u2019s path and in some industries bartering is ok, but as a serious business owner, with a very clear sense of my value, and a stable of clients who see that value too, I don\u2019t need a relationship with someone who questions that value from the get-go.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Slow Paying Client<\/strong><br \/>\nThese are hard to spot until you\u2019re locked into a contract or scope of work, but, oh boy, there are lots out there. Often it\u2019s through no fault of the person that you\u2019re working with directly. Sometimes good old bureaucracy, slow processes, or cash flow management practices on your client\u2019s part can translate to problems for you. There are a few things you can do to mitigate this, like making your contract work for you by including options like a deposit, kill fees, late fees, and milestone payments.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes these won\u2019t get you anywhere, and like I said, these late payers are hard to spot until it\u2019s too late. In these cases, make sure you invoice often, that your terms are clear, monitor payment status diligently, find out the name of the person who cuts your checks, and chase. Here are some more direct, yet diplomatic ways for dealing with a slow-paying client.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Client Who Knows Best<\/strong><br \/>\nClients have every right to get what they want, but if they hire you to guide them towards their goals and then constantly question your expertise and insist that you do it their way instead of yours, you\u2019ll run into trouble. Not only does the relationship become tricky to manage, but you\u2019ll actually find yourself trying to fit in with a way of doing things that is contrary to your proven framework for client success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Unresponsive Client<\/strong><br \/>\nYou know the one. This client doesn\u2019t respond to emails, doesn\u2019t review your work, and gets in the way of you doing your job and billing for it promptly. I once had a client who needed a piece of work yesterday; I delivered, but it sat in his inbox for six weeks, leaving me high and dry with an open project that I couldn\u2019t invoice for. I\u2019ve since learned my lesson, as soon as a client becomes unreasonably unresponsive I promptly bill for work done either at a milestone phase or as soon as I sense that the client has gone underground. An invoice is often more effective at capturing their attention than another reminder email.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line \u2013 How to Cut them Loose<\/strong><br \/>\nFinding the right client is incredibly important to your well-being and bottom line. Your clients are often an extension of yourself or your team, so recognizing the signs of a dud client is one of the most important lessons you\u2019ll learn. If you get stuck with a client that you just can\u2019t afford to hold onto, you might want to cut them loose. A few ways to do this include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising your prices so that they are forced to look elsewhere<\/li>\n<li>Tell them that your bandwidth is constrained and that you need to cut back on services or time<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re dealing with a non-paying client, tell them that you need to revisit the payment terms of your agreement. If they can\u2019t commit to paying to an agreed schedule, you have your way out!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my nearly ten years of small business ownership, perhaps one of the most advantageous lessons I\u2019ve learned is that &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1840,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11504,677],"yst_prominent_words":[723,875,713,3519,1248,773,4435,3926,6003,6004,846,3499,3537,3235,3050,3511,5215,3300,2074,3090],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"5 Types of Small Business Clients to Avoid","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Here are five client types that I\u2019ve chosen to avoid doing business with, or when I do I put mitigating measures in place to deal with their quirks!"},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"5 Types of Small Business Clients to Avoid"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Here are five client types that I\u2019ve chosen to avoid doing business with, or when I do I put mitigating measures in place to deal with their quirks!"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-deadbeat-clients-cant-afford-take\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_235192807.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_235192807.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"666"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Here are five client types that I\u2019ve chosen to avoid doing business with, or when I do I put mitigating measures in place to deal with their quirks!"},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"5 Types of Small Business Clients to Avoid"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_235192807.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-deadbeat-clients-cant-afford-take\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3728"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3728"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3728\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14384,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3728\/revisions\/14384"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1840"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3728"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3728"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3728"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=3728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
