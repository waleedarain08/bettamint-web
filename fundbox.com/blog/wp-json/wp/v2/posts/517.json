For example, if you suffered a medical condition that stopped you from applying or you experienced an enrollment error (i.e. one of those notorious HealthCare.gov launch glitches), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/sep-list\/\">and more<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you fall into any of these categories and meet the income criteria for a Marketplace plan you can go ahead and apply on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment\/#part=2\">HealthCare.gov<\/a>. If not, you may need to reconsider your options, since the next open enrollment for Obamacare runs from November 15, 2014 \u2013 February 15, 2015.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Low-Income Options &#8211; Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/how-can-i-get-coverage-outside-of-open-enrollment\/#part=3\">Medicaid and CHIP enrollment<\/a> is open year-round for low income individuals and families. Coverage options depend on the state where you live. For example, if you live in a state that&#8217;s expanding Medicaid (meaning the federal government is throwing more funds at the program), you&#8217;ll probably qualify if you make up to $16,105 a year for 1 person ($32,913 for a family of 4). Read more about Medicaid and CHIP as an option on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/what-if-my-state-is-not-expanding-medicaid\/\">HealthCare.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s take a look at some non-government affordable healthcare programs specifically designed for the self-employed:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health Spending Accounts (HSA)<\/strong><br \/>\nHSAs are basically savings accounts that you contribute to on a month pre-tax basis (up to an IRS-enforced limit) and then use a debit card to cover qualifying medical and health-related expenses. These plans are often cheaper because they have a higher annual deductible and any money you don\u2019t spend rolls over from year-to-year \u2013 making HSAs a useful option for younger, healthy business owners. Read more about HSAs from <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/retirement\/guide\/insurance_health.moneymag\/index10.htm\">CNN Money<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Call your current insurance company to see if your current health insurance policy qualifies to be used with a HSA. A licensed health insurance agent can help you with this process. Make sure you consult a tax advisor to make sure you\u2019re realizing the tax savings to the max!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chamber of Commerce HealthCare Programs<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re a member of your local Chamber of Commerce, many offer lower-cost health insurance packages for both self-employed business owners as well as those with more than one employee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Small Business Incubators<\/strong><br \/>\nSmall business incubators are popping up all over the country offering everything from low-cost co-working space, networking opportunities, and access to business software such as payroll, CRM, and more. One membership-based incubator, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wework.com\/\">WeWork<\/a>, which operates nearly 30 co-working locations, also draws on the size and strength of its community to negotiate low insurance rates for members.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Freelancers Union<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you live in the state of New York, sole proprietors and freelancers may qualify for plans administered by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersinsuranceco.com\/fic\/\">Freelancers Insurance Company (FIC<\/a>), formed by the Freelancers Union. FIC offers affordable health insurance plans to its members and their families. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersinsuranceco.com\/fic\/shopping\/index.html\">Individual plans<\/a> start at $471 per month with no co-pays, it also includes other perks such as free yoga, acupuncture and personal health coaching at its Manhattan and Brooklyn locations. FIC plans are subject to an open enrollment period, however, as with Obamacare, qualifying events such as births, marriage, or loss of existing coverage will open the doors to special enrollment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other Membership Organizations<\/strong><br \/>\nIn addition to your Chamber of Commerce, other unions, organizations, and alumni associations also provide self-employed healthcare plans. A quick Google search will list relevant organizations by industry and profession. Remember to factor in the cost of membership as you compare plans.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of the some member organizations that offer healthcare plans (care of <a href=\"http:\/\/personalinsure.about.com\/od\/health\/a\/aa042808a.htm\">Bobbie Sage<\/a> at About.com):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nase.org\/Membership\/MembersBenefits\/BenefitDetails.aspx?BenefitId=38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association for the Self-Employed<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.aarphealthcare.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AARP Health<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.affordableservices.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alliance for Affordable Services<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Association of Female Executives<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sbsb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small Business Service Bureau<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t Forget \u2013 Healthcare Premiums are Tax Deductible<\/strong><br \/>\nThe good news for the self-employed is that your monthly premiums are a 100% tax deduction. You can also deduct total medical expenses in excess of 10% of your adjusted gross income. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/\">Read more from IRS.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you miss the Obamacare enrollment deadline of March 31?
