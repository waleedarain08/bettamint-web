Consider it an opportunity to not only get to know your customers better but to also think about how you can enhance the customer service experience overall. The outcome? How does repeat business and the development of a strong customer base sound (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/khoros.com\/blog\/must-know-customer-service-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because data indicates that this will be the result<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few ways you can enhance customer experience (with the ultimate goal of winning new customers and solidifying relationships with existing ones) on Get To Know Your Customers Day, and all the days that follow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be strategic about free consultations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In service-based businesses, free consultations sometimes seem par for the course. Unfortunately, free consultations often fail to convert prospects into clients because the consultations are nothing more than thinly veiled sales pitches. If you run the type of small business known for offering free consultations\u2014like a hair salon, a personal training studio, a photography business or a tax preparation firm, for example\u2014and you choose to offer them,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/win-new-customers-with-free-consultations\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make sure that you are conducting each consultation in manner that leaves your prospect with a positive impression of your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. One way to do this is to focus on getting to know the customer during the consultation rather than just telling them about all the goods and services you have to offer. This way, potential clients will know you truly committed to serving their needs rather than just getting them to swipe their credit card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep customers in the loop<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you changing your hours? Re-evaluating your COVID-19 protocols? Eliminating or adding services? This is certainly your prerogative as a business owner, but you need to make sure your customers (and potential customers) know what\u2019s up so they aren\u2019t caught off guard. Imagine how frustrated they\u2019ll feel when they show up at your door and find the place all locked up (on a day you are normally open for business).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t have to happen, though\u2014customer experience is greatly enhanced by the simple act of keeping people updated on your hours, policies, procedures and offerings. All you have to do is regularly log on to your website to update pertinent information, edit your business listing on Google, post updates on social media, distribute the information via email to customers, etc. Your time investment is minimal, but the payoff is tremendous due to the fact you are eliminating the risk of losing a potential customer over them receiving outdated information about your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to feedback from newer and loyal customers alike<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soliciting feedback is the first step\u2014and you can do this in a variety of ways, like surveys, questionnaires or asking them directly about their experience\u2014but the important part is to really take that feedback to heart. If someone expresses concern about a customer service encounter, for example, make sure that customer knows that you are committed to making it right. If the customer survey you send out reveals a pattern of behavior among staff members that needs to be addressed, address it. If your online reviews leave something to be desired, investigate and make changes as needed. Most importantly, thank your customers for sharing their thoughts with you so they know their voices have been heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive feedback is worth acknowledging, as well. First and foremost, it never hurts to say \u2018thanks\u2019 when a customer gives you a five-star review. Also, keep in mind that if customers say they appreciate something they may want more of the same. Whatever it is, continue to provide it to them and their customer experience is bound to be enhanced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer incentives to loyal customers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-established, larger companies often have the resources to set up attractive loyalty programs, and statistics indicate that customers love them\u2014according to the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/f.hubspotusercontent10.net\/hubfs\/352767\/TLR%20Library\/Bond%20Loyalty%20Report%202020_US%20ExecSummary.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Bond Brand Loyalty Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 78% of folks surveyed say they are more likely to continue doing business with brands that have loyalty or reward programs (and 72% are more likely to recommend brands with loyalty programs to friends).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small business owners can get in on this, too. Even if your resources don\u2019t allow you to put together a multi-tiered program with all the bells and whistles, you can still reward loyal customers in other ways. Simple incentives like gifts, freebies, discounts and special insider deals can go a long way toward enhancing the customer relationship with your loyal patrons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay attention to social media analytics<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose to use social media to engage with existing and potential customers (and data suggests this is a good idea,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/chart\/226029\/us-social-media-users-by-generation-2019-of-population\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">especially if you are targeting Millennials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/2021\/04\/07\/social-media-use-in-2021\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gen Zers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), posting regularly and learning the ins-and-outs of the individual platforms is important and beneficial\u2014but don\u2019t stop there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the major social media platforms, from Instagram and Facebook to TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn and Snapchat, provide usage analytics to small business owners. In order to really get to know your customers (and grow business, to boot), consider taking the time to study these analytics\u2014they provide valuable details about the demographics of your social media audience, as well as information about how certain posts are performing, how many people are clicking through to your website and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have this information, you can use it to more effectively reach the folks most likely to interact with you on social media. Rather than just posting updates randomly, for example, you\u2019ll have insight as to the types of posts most likely to appeal to active users, and you\u2019ll know when these active users are logging on to your page. As an added bonus, through the process of elimination you\u2019ll also learn which demographic is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> responding to your social media posts so you can find alternative ways to get to know them better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need more ideas to help you grow your small business and keep your customers coming back again and again?
