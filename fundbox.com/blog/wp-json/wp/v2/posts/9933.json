Located near TD Garden (home of the Celtics and Bruins), the pub is a popular destination for after-hours visitors looking for comfort food and local beer.<\/p>\n<p>But in the summertime, the area goes dark, the ice on the hockey rink melts, and the event facilities furlough their employees. With its busy season heavily concentrated between October and April, the lean summer months present a tough cash flow situation for Porters.<\/p>\n<p>Not all businesses experience the same degree of seasonality as Porters, but most businesses do have predictable times of year when business is significantly slower. These large swings in revenue make it difficult to manage cash flow throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>The harsh reality is most small businesses fail within five years because they don\u2019t have the capital to keep the doors open, according to a new <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpmorganchase.com\/content\/dam\/jpmorganchase\/en\/legacy\/corporate\/institute\/document\/institute-growth-vitality-cash-flows-exec-summary.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">study<\/a><\/span>. The life expectancy of businesses in specific industries is closely tied to the cash flow challenges each presents:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Real estate: <\/span>9 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Health care services: <\/span>8.8 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">High-tech services: \u00a0 <\/span>6.2 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Construction:<\/span>\u00a05.1 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Personal services:<\/span>\u00a04.9 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wholesalers:<\/span>\u00a0 4.7 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Repair &amp; maintenance: <\/span>\u00a04.6 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Retail:<\/span>\u00a04 years<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Restaurants<\/span>: 3.7 years<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The study also reveals that working capital loans and lines of credit can help small businesses manage irregular cash flow and extend the life of their operations. The research shows that cash flow management is as important as liquidity. If a small business can\u2019t properly manage its cash flow, it\u2019s unlikely to grow. With a loan to get through the lean months and get cash flow back on track, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendio.com\/blog\/small-business-spotlights\/porters-bar\/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Porters Bar &amp; Grill has far exceeded its life expectancy<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and is positioned to increase its annual revenue.<\/p>\n<p>There are many <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business\/\">ways to manage cash flow in a seasonal business<\/a><\/span>, or to handle the peaks and valleys in revenue that every business experiences. But when it comes to using smart financing to solve this big problem, the secret lies in being proactive about accessing capital.\u00a0 Sometimes, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mymillennialguide.com\/best-money-making-apps-for-2017\/\">best money making apps<\/a> can help you gain additional income.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five ways to put this principle into practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Invoice financing<\/h2>\n<p>Invoice financing is easy to confuse with invoice <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">factoring<\/span>, and it\u2019s helpful to know about both. Invoice <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">factoring<\/span>\u00a0allows your business to sell its invoices at a discount in exchange for a lump sum of cash. Invoice factoring can provide immediate working capital to help cover any cash flow issues and is typically easier to get approved for than traditional bank loans.<\/p>\n<p>But, traditional invoice factoring generally requires you to sell your unpaid invoices to a third party factoring company. Your customers then pay the factoring company\u2014not you. A slightly different approach called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">invoice <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\">financing<\/span>\u00a0can help you avoid this less-than-ideal repayment scenario, giving you access to a revolving credit line that won\u2019t affect your client relationships.<\/p>\n<h2>Business credit cards<\/h2>\n<p>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">business credit card<\/span>\u00a0is great for capital upgrades such as computers but can also be handy for emergency situations and slow seasons. Like personal credit cards, business credit cards offer the benefit of rewards like cash, points, or miles based on how much you spend.<\/p>\n<p>If you have trouble staying within budget or tend to overspend, be careful with cards. Also be aware of annual fees and interest rates, and take advantage of promotional rates when you can. Always do your research before applying.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9938\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/shutterstock_567634105.jpg\" alt=\"Business Credit Cards\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/shutterstock_567634105.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/shutterstock_567634105-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Lines of credit<\/h2>\n<p>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">business line of credit<\/span>\u00a0is a loan that allows you to withdraw money, when you need it, from a set amount instead of borrowing a lump sum. Business lines of credit are a great option if you\u2019re looking to buy goods, grow your business, and\/or expand your company, and they can also be an invaluable lifeline in case of an emergency or a cash flow crunch.<\/p>\n<h2>Short term loans<\/h2>\n<p>A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">short term business loan<\/span>\u00a0can keep your company operating through slower seasons and help you cover unplanned expenses. They\u2019re also handy for helping you finance unexpected growth opportunities that pop up. Short term loans typically offer smaller funding amounts with higher interest rates\u2014around 10% and higher\u2014and they have shorter repayment periods. It\u2019s not uncommon for lenders to request that borrowers pay back the loan on a weekly or daily basis.<\/p>\n<h2>Cash advances<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendio.com\/business-loans\/cash-advance\/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=4\">C<\/a>a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendio.com\/business-loans\/cash-advance\/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part2CashFlow&amp;keywords=4\">sh <\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">advances<\/span>\u00a0are quick and unsecured, which means you won\u2019t have to forfeit any personal or business assets if business is bad. Because there is no fixed term with cash advances, they can be a great solution for businesses that need to pay less during slower months.<\/p>\n<p>Cash advances generally come with a high annual percentage rate, and this can make them far more expensive than a traditional business loan. Business owners should proceed with caution to fully understand the terms and properly vet any cash advance provider before jumping in. Make sure you understand the provider\u2019s interest rates, how the rates compare to other loan products, and how they compare to other providers\u2019 rates.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to managing cash flow crunches, aim to play offense, not defense. When you\u2019re proactive about accessing funds you can build a safety net for cash flow emergencies as well as better support innovation and prevent missed opportunities for your business to grow. Proactive financing will allow you to make things happen, rather than waiting for something to happen so you can take your business to the next level on your timeline.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Check back next month for part 3 of our series, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How Smart Financing Can Solve Big Problems for Small Businesses<\/span>, where you\u2019ll learn helpful strategies for how to stay passionate through the ups and downs of running a business.<\/p>\n<p><em>No matter the size, the time in business, or the industry, every small business faces a myriad of challenges daily.
