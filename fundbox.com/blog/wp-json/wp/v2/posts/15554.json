They may go to school for an MBA or find that they have a knack for starting businesses as early in life as a childhood lemonade stand. Others find opportunities in entrepreneurship out of necessity. During lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals started small businesses. This allowed them to pursue their passions and earn a profit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, others discover entrepreneurship with a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment for a new product or offering. Take the example of businesswoman Sara Blakely. Years ago, Blakely <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/sara-blakely\/how-sara-blakley-started-spanx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut the feet out of her control top pantyhose<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to wear under a pair of pants to a party. Voila\u2014the pants had no visible lines underneath. This remixed take on a traditional shaper allowed Blakely to create the patent for the shapewear we now know as Spanx. Today, Blakely is one of the world\u2019s most famous entrepreneurs!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does someone reach that point and decide that they are ready to become an entrepreneur? The best way to get started answering this question is to discover your why.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Discover your why<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do you want to become an entrepreneur?

One of these reasons below could be your \u201cwhy\u201d as an entrepreneur.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to make a difference in your community.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You dream of turning your passion into your life\u2019s work.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have an idea for a new offering or service that you know will change people\u2019s lives.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You enjoy learning by doing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re ready for a challenge.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re passionate about finding your purpose.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as you know why, you\u2019ll be ready to start setting short- and long-term goals for your startup.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you need to start a business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting a small business is no easy undertaking. There are plenty of challenges presented to those that commit to becoming an entrepreneur. However, if you know what to expect ahead of time you will be prepared to address each one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common challenges facing entrepreneurs in 2021 and suggested solutions for overcoming these issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes you qualified to start a business?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have several years of existing experience in the field. If you don\u2019t have enough experience, or what is considered the right experience, consider upskilling. You can do this by enrolling in relevant online courses, watching webinars, and listening to podcasts to learn from experienced individuals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner or solo?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you start the business on your own or would you like to go into business with a partner?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that being in a partnership requires both partners to work equally together. Having a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mycorporation.com\/2021\/05\/business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">written partnership agreement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a big help in smoothly running the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you wear many hats?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming an entrepreneur, particularly in the early days in your startup\u2019s lifecycle, means you will be doing the work of several people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it can be difficult to manage this much work especially if it is outside of your skill set. If hiring full-time isn\u2019t a feasible option right now, consider outsourcing work to contractors or freelancers that have the skills to complete it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will you acquire customers?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business idea should be viable and for an offering or service that customers actually want (and will pay for!).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start conducting market research to determine your target audience and establish buyer personas to better understand your demographics. You may also collect customer feedback through focus groups and surveys conducted via social media and in e-newsletters.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will the business receive funding?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fund the business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are planning to quit your job to start a business, you\u2019ll need a significant financial cushion to become an entrepreneur and attend to your finances and expenses. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may include financing from investors, taking out a business loan, applying for grants, using crowdfunding platforms, or attracting the interest of an angel investor or venture capitalist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does work\/life balance look like?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is true that becoming an entrepreneur means putting plenty of energy, time, and commitment into the business and its idea, the end result should not be one where you feel completely overwhelmed or burned out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider starting your small business as a side hustle before making the plunge to take it full-time. Use this time to grow the business and observe how you are able to maintain work-life balance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a scaling strategy?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As sales rise and your business enjoys a steady influx of cash flow, consider putting\u00a0 together a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-entrepreneurs-reveal-how-they-scaled-their-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scaling strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This may help\u00a0 ensure your business keeps growing its revenue through its business model and may allow you to expand into new markets over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpful tools for entrepreneurs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming an entrepreneur requires having an entrepreneurial toolkit. Here are some of the most critical components to include in your toolkit for success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Create a business plan<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/create-a-business-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will act as the foundation for which you can build your business. Think of it as a roadmap to becoming an entrepreneur. You may use a business plan to set goals (both short- and long-term) for your business to reach and set timelines to get to these goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business plan allows you to detail more about who you are and what the business does. You may use this space to analyze your competition through an industry analysis and your customers through a market analysis. A business plan allows you to share the financial projections of your company and outline a funding request from potential investors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that a business plan may be revised over time. Take note as you reach certain goals\u2014and begin planning for how to reach your future goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Incorporate or form an LLC<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mycorporation.com\/2020\/08\/sole-proprietors-form-llc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forming an LLC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your business is one of the best tools an entrepreneur has in their business toolkit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating as a business entity, like a limited liability company (LLC) or corporation, provides your business with limited liability protection. This creates a separation between your personal and professional assets. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, your personal belongings will not be impacted or used as collateral. Additionally, incorporating a business can provide tax benefits and allow you to establish credibility faster with consumers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Network<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entrepreneurship is not meant to be done alone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll need a network of the best and brightest in your corner. Some of these people may include mentors, close family members and friends, and other entrepreneurs that you admire\u2014and that admire you in return! Remember to build your network as much as you continue to network and grow the business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Act with confidence<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Becoming an entrepreneur is hard work, but it is also rewarding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are doing it! You are working to create an offering or service that will change the lives of others for the better by bringing\u00a0 this idea to life.
