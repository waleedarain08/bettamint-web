Accept the fact that all businesses have to pay taxes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You might think your tax ninja skills are better than everyone else\u2019s when it comes to reducing your overall responsibility, but at the end of the day, everyone has to pay their taxes. Your small business isn\u2019t <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/11\/20\/why-new-tax-inversion-rules-wont-stop-pfizer-allergan-deal\/\">Pfizer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. File your taxes on time to avoid a tax audit<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you stay on top of your tax situation all year long, you won\u2019t be in for a rude awakening come tax time. However, even if you aren&#8217;t on top of your tax needs, you still need to file your taxes on time. (Don\u2019t forget: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.libertytax.com\/\">We have until April 18 in 2016<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Because\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/Extension-of-Time-To-File-Your-Tax-Return\">the IRS allows an extended deadline<\/a> if you ask for it, there\u2019s really no reason to pay late. Missing the deadline could result in a\u00a0red flag for you\u2014leading to a tax audit.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. Make sure your numbers are precise<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A common sense reminder: Check your math, then\u00a0check it again.\u00a0If your numbers don\u2019t match up with the numbers your clients provide to the IRS, there\u2019s a good chance that the tax man will say hello to you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">4. Remember: You can\u2019t deduct everything<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You may be tempted to buy a new RV and deduct the whole thing because you drove it to a conference once, but the IRS wasn\u2019t born yesterday.\u00a0According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf\">SBA<\/a>, there are 28 million small businesses in the United States. The IRS knows the tax code, and they\u2019ve seen it all before\u2014even that super fancy \u201cloophole\u201d you think you\u2019ve uncovered.<\/p>\n<p>Err on the side of caution.\u00a0If you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re legally allowed to deduct, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed\/Deducting-Business-Expenses\">why not head straight to the source<\/a>?\u00a0Better yet, ask your accountant.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">5. Hire employees\u2014don\u2019t rely solely on independent contractors<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Part of the reason businesses like working with independent contractors is because in doing so, they avoid having to pay payroll taxes. However,\u00a0the IRS has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed\/Independent-Contractor-Self-Employed-or-Employee\">very clear guidelines<\/a> as to exactly which workers need to be classified as employees and which can be classified as freelancers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re classifying a lot of the folks you depend on as contractors, the IRS might ask you to open your books.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">6. Cooperate with any communications from the IRS<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Whatever your opinion of the government agency is, the IRS is certainly not a force to be reckoned with. Just ask <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/people\/2013\/04\/05\/wesley-snipes-finishes-jail-time-for-tax-evasion\/2057455\/\">Wesley Snipes<\/a>.\u00a0If you get a letter in the mail from the IRS, responding should be a top priority.<\/p>\n<p>The IRS is not the bogeyman. Like anyone else, IRS agents are just doing their jobs: making sure you\u2019re paying your taxes properly.\u00a0They won\u2019t be feisty right away, but they\u2019ll remind you who they are if you ignore their requests and inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line: If you keep accurate records and run your operations honestly, you won\u2019t have anything to worry about, even if you have the misfortune of getting audited\u2014but\u00a0you don\u2019t want to lose time talking to the tax man when you don\u2019t have to, so plan accordingly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re not prepared, receiving a request from the IRS for a tax audit\u00a0can be an absolute nightmare\u2014and even if &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":4588,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[5109,6488,1132,6486,4058,6483,6480,3148,1957,3376,6485,6487,3040,712,3259,6481,6484,4558,6482,3300],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"6 Tips to Avoid a Small Business Tax Audit | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"If you\u2019re not prepared, receiving a request from the IRS for a tax audit can be an absolute nightmare.
