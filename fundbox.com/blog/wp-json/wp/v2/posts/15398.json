Not only does the business need to solve a specific need\u2014whether that\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/preparing-business-tax-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tax preparation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">landscaping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ways-marketing-agencies-can-grow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing functions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014it also needs to provide exceptional services at agreeable price points.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To increase the chances you get the results you\u2019re hoping for, find your niche, and try to build a business that you\u2019re absolutely passionate about.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By doing so, you\u2019ll be solving a very pressing need. Plus, your enthusiasm will permeate through all that you do, and your team will feed off of that energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the first thing to do when starting a business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start a small business, you need to conduct market research to make sure your idea is worth pursuing. You also have to pick a name, figure out pricing, and take care of legal requirements\u2014like forming an LLC, securing requisite certifications, and obtaining whatever insurance your business requires.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since your business will only be as strong as the people that work for it, you need to make sure that you hire the right team. Do your due diligence, thoroughly vet candidates, and pay them well\u2014perhaps even more than what competitors are paying, if you can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes from growing a small business into a big one, all of the above is table stakes\u2014just enough to get you started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your goal is to create a small business that will one day be massive, you first need to develop a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-marketing-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that helps you increase brand awareness, engage your audience, and attract new customers. With the right approach, it\u2019s possible to build an incredible following that\u2019s with you for years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, you can\u2019t just open your doors for the first time and expect customers to come flocking in. Whatever the nature of your business is, you\u2019ll need an effective marketing strategy to take it to the next level\u2014and certainly to realize its full potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you begin to put your marketing strategy together to grow your small business, it\u2019s important to understand the four proven strategies that lead to organic business growth.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the four small business growth strategies?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As every small business owner knows too well, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to knock it out of the park on the first day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re first starting out, it\u2019s all about figuring out how to bring in more money than you&#8217;re dishing out to keep the lights on. But once you\u2019ve conquered the first year and see your financial situation improve, chances are you\u2019ll want to figure out how to do even better moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, here are four strategies for organic business growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Product development<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Coca-Cola was just starting out, the company had a single product: a tasty sugary water drink we all know as Coke.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast-forward to today, and the company now sells over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coca-colacompany.com\/faqs\/how-many-brands-does-coca-cola-have#:~:text=coca%2Dcola%2Dhave-,The%20Coca%2DCola%20Company%20is%20a%20total%20beverage%20company%2C%20offering,in%20more%20than%20200%20countries.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">500 brands of beverages<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and, at the time of this writing, boasts a market cap in excess of $232 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you begin to think about taking your business to the next level, it\u2019s worth considering whether your business can grow its bottom line by developing new products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the beginning of this article, we talked about the genesis of Google, Amazon, and McDonalds. Over time, all three of those companies have developed a considerable amount of products that serve the same market, which has helped them grow into the juggernauts they are today.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Market development<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to grow your small business into a larger one is by doing whatever you can to tap into new markets. Just like Amazon moved from books to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0064BFJ3W\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">literally everything else<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your business can begin targeting a whole new market of customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a successful restaurant owner might decide to open a second location in another town to tap into a new customer base. Or, they might even opt to open up a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/start-food-truck-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food truck business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cater to mobile clientele.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it boils down to it, market development is all about spreading your wings and trying to sell your products or services into a wider geography or category of consumers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">painting business <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">might expand to the next county and a residential landscaper might try to land commercial accounts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know your business better than anyone else does. Spend some time thinking about the additional markets your company may be able to tap into, and act on your findings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Market penetration\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say you\u2019re launching a new barber shop.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the easiest ways to grow a business from the outset is by embracing the market penetration strategy\u2014pricing your products or services aggressively low to entice customers to give your business a shot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your competitor charges $30 for a haircut, you charge $18, and you will price-conscious shoppers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thinking, here, is straightforward: Take customers away from your competitors with attractive prices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, once you\u2019ve established your brand, you can gradually increase your prices to get them back to whatever the market commands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Curious what market penetration looks like in action? Amazon once took a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2020\/07\/emails-detail-amazons-plan-to-crush-a-startup-rival-with-price-cuts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$200 million loss on diapers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to prevent a startup rival from capturing digital market share!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Diversification\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, supercharging your business growth requires drastic measures. And that\u2019s where the diversification strategy enters the mix.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At is core, diversification is about designing new products for a new market. It\u2019s about reinventing the wheel entirely\u2014and hoping that your pivot is successful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most popular examples of the diversification strategy is Nokia, a Finnish conglomerate that started out as a paper mill and has since pivoted to network equipment, mobile radios, mobile phones, and personal computers. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_Nokia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about Nokia\u2019s evolution<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019re familiar with the four different strategies for business growth, it\u2019s time to pick the one that makes sense for your unique circumstances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But picking a strategy isn\u2019t the end all be all. To get the results you\u2019re looking for, you need to execute on it successfully.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up next, we\u2019ll examine some tips to keep in mind as you begin growing your small business into an enormous one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips to keep in mind as you focus on business growth<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they say, it takes 20 years of hard work to become an overnight success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you can\u2019t snap your fingers and will succeed into existence, you can develop a framework that significantly increases the chances you achieve your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, here are three tips to keep in mind as you scale your idea into a fully baked organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get feedback from the people who matter most<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a reason we all know the saying that tells us the customer is always right: They are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to generate organic business growth is by regularly soliciting feedback from your customers\u2014and implementing the best of their ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does this help you refine your offerings to meet customer expectations, it also engages your base by showing them that you\u2019re not only interested in what they have to say\u2014but you\u2019re actually paying attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collect feedback at regular intervals, and your business will be in a much stronger position because of it. It\u2019s that simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a financing option in place<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There comes a time in the life of every small business when an extra injection of cash is necessary.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some situations, you might need money to cover operating expenses after some unexpected event derailed your plans (e.g., <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). In others, you might want some extra cash to invest in growth opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the case may be, growth-oriented small business owners need to have fast access to cash on standby. That way, when the circumstances warrant it, they will be able to quickly get the money they need to make the next move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about starting a new business and imagine you might need an extra cash infusion at some point in the future, you may want to look into <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/sba-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, you might also want to secure a business line of credit. By doing so, you\u2019ll have access to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revolving credit line<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can tap into on an as-needed basis. Replenish the credit line as funds come in to stay in good standing, and draw against it only when you need to.<\/span><\/p>\n\n    <section class=\"cta-section\">\n        <h3>\n            Ready for more?\n        <\/h3>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-8 col-xl-9\">\n                <p>Apply for funding and find out if you qualify today<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-xl-3\">\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup?utm_source=fundbox&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=other&utm_content=grow-a-small-business\" class=\"signup-btn\">\n                    Apply Now\n                <\/a>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider strategic partnerships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no rule that says you have to grow your business on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By forming a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/leveraging-strategic-partnerships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014think: Barnes and Noble and Starbucks\u2014you can bring your products or services in front of more customers in a mutually beneficial way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you run a carpentry business, you might decide to join forces with an electrician. Each of you could recommend the other as jobs pop up, and so forth. And, of course, you could work together on projects that required both skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other small business strategic partnerships could include a restaurant partnering with a local brewery to sell beer with their meals, a copywriting agency partnering with a graphic design studio for content marketing collaboration, and nursery partnering with a landscaping company to be the exclusive provider of plants, shrubs, and trees for every job.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to take your small business to the next level?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing a small business into a big one isn\u2019t easy.
