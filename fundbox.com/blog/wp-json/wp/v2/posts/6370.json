While this is undoubtedly positive for those businesses, the busiest time of the year can present unique cash flow challenges for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate a construction company, for example, you might have funds tied up in supplies and building materials. That can make it harder to pay for other vital expenses \u2014 like payroll, utilities, gasoline, insurance, and more. You might also have to pay contractors and subcontractors before your customers settle their bills. Then, there\u2019s always the risk that a job runs over budget, leaving you with a skinnier profit margin than you planned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landscaping companies run into similar problems. With more lawns to mow and more gardens to maintain, you might decide to buy or lease more equipment \u2014 tying up cash along the way. Customers might not always pay their invoices on time either, creating additional financial challenges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade credit: The $3.1 trillion question<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One primary reason that construction and landscaping companies \u2014 along with businesses in virtually all other industries \u2014 run into cash flow problems is that they deal in<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/trade-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> trade credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Trade credit, also called \u201cnet terms,\u201d refers to the conventional method of financing transactions between sellers and buyers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how trade credit works: A seller might pay upfront for inventory, services, or supplies to a buyer, giving them 30, 60, 90, or even 120 days to pay their bills. A landscaping subcontractor, for example, might invoice their clients at the end of the month and then give them 30 days to pay from there. On the flip side, a construction company might use trade credit to get building materials, tools, roofing supplies, and more from a supplier and have 60 days before payment is due.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, sellers\u2014who would undoubtedly prefer to be paid immediately on every sale\u2014accept trade credit because it\u2019s the standard. Without offering it, it\u2019s nearly impossible for those sellers to compete. Buyers, however, typically like the arrangement because they\u2019re able to purchase more than they otherwise could, which helps them grow their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should be noted that according to research from<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/smbs\/2019\/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> PYMNTS and Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, trade credit has severe, often damaging financial implications for U.S. businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PYMNTS survey found that on any given day U.S. companies are collectively owed $3.1 trillion in unpaid invoices, making it that much harder for them to run their businesses. When merchants extend trade credit, they themselves cannot plan to get paid on time, as some customers will pay even later than the agreed-to terms. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/b2b-payments\/2019\/report-the-reason-48-pct-of-high-margin-smbs-pay-suppliers-late\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these customers expect to be able to pay late<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because they consider themselves to be such good customers. For years, this has been the norm, especially in B2B transactions and certain trades like construction or landscaping.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge with traditional trade credit arrangements<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade credit essentially makes the companies that extend it assume the role of a bank for their clients\u2014but without the upside (like the interest that accrues immediately). Even if every single client pays on time, there are still massive administrative implications to consider. For example, reviewing applications for trade credit, approving those applications, setting up new customers with accounts or terms, making sure invoices are sent on time, keeping track of who owes what, and staying on top of when payments are due are all time-consuming back-office tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s safe to say in the age of automation, the current system of trade credit leaves a lot to be desired.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s more, while receivables might look beautiful on the balance sheet, you can\u2019t exactly use those funds to grow a business. Managing day-to-day operations while waiting for funds to arrive can be needlessly stressful and challenging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for pursuing new opportunities or investing in new initiatives? That\u2019s often out of the question, too, without a comfortable sum in the bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that no matter which side of the transaction you\u2019re on, your construction or landscaping business can take advantage of innovative new solutions offered by fintech companies. Technology is rapidly expanding opportunities for businesses to get easier access to the funds they need to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Fundbox can help you access the working capital your business needs through a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
