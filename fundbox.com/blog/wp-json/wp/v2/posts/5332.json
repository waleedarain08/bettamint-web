Pitching your products and solutions to the world&#8217;s biggest consumer\u2014the U.S. government?<\/p>\n<p>The business of selling to the government (more formally known as government contracting) can be a lucrative opportunity for businesses of all sizes. The government spends ~$500 billion each year on everything from paper clips to jet propulsion engines, and that&#8217;s not all: It even supplements its own workforce with advisors, consultants, website developers, and even bloggers!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Federal Government &#8220;Sets Aside&#8221; $$ for Small Business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The government&#8217;s approach to buying from small business is strategic and deliberate.\u00a0 Each fiscal year, the government sets aside a portion of its annual budget to purchase from small businesses. This serves several purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It ensures not that there is a level playing field and that large businesses don&#8217;t &#8220;muscle out&#8221; small firms.<\/li>\n<li>It gives the government access to new ideas and innovations.<\/li>\n<li>It supports job creation (small businesses are the main job creators in the United States).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/small-business-set-asides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8220;set aside&#8221; contracts<\/a> take many forms. They can involve certain tasks on a larger contract (known as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/contracting\/finding-government-customers\/subcontracting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sub-contracting<\/a>&#8220;\u2014a great way to get your foot in the door) or an entire contract (&#8220;prime&#8221; contracting). These contracts can also be set aside for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/women-owned-small-business-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">women-owned small businesses<\/a> (just recently, for the first time in history, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/sba-federal-government-breaks-contracting-record-women-owned-small-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">federal government finally met its women&#8217;s contracting goal<\/a>), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sdvosb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service-disabled veteran-owned businesses<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/federal-contracting\/contracting-assistance-programs\/small-disadvantaged-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small, disadvantaged businesses<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/navigation-structure\/government-contracting-programs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Getting a Share of Those Government Contracting Dollars Isn&#8217;t Easy<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sounds great! But wait. Selling to the federal government requires know-how, commitment, and patience. The government buys its goods and services in very different ways compared to the private sector. Businesses must qualify and register to do business with Uncle Sam, you must understand the bidding process, and you must comply with the rules and regulations that apply to different kinds of purchases. You&#8217;ll also need a skilled team of experts who know how to navigate and manage contract vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Your government marketing engine needs investment too\u2014the government speaks a different language from other sectors and they have different pain points and challenges. They look for a strong track record and solid proof of performance. Throwing commercial marketing materials at the feds won&#8217;t help your case.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a complex landscape and one that deters many businesses, but don&#8217;t be dissuaded. There are many resources that can help, and government agencies are pushing hard to spread awareness among small businesses about the process.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Start with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The SBA is probably most well-known for its loan programs, but it also advocates for small business government contracting and works with several agencies to help ensure small firms get their share of contracts. As such, the SBA runs numerous programs that help small firms grow their government business through training, counseling, workshops, mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, and more. Here are some worth knowing about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SBA Online Resources <\/strong>\u2013 The SBA&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/category\/navigation-structure\/contracting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contracting Guide<\/a> on SBA.gov walks through the ins and outs of doing business with Uncle Sam and explains what it takes to get started. If you prefer self-paced training, explore the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/gcclassroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Government Contracting Classroom<\/a>, a free, online, multi-part course. SBA also maintains a contracting topic in its blog network.<\/li>\n<li><strong>In-Person Help <\/strong>\u2013 SBA has on-the-ground <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/procurement-center-representatives-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Procurement Centers<\/a> that can assist you in navigating the process.
