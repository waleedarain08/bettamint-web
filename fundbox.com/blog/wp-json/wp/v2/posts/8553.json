But does that mean it\u2019s easier for business owners to get financing?<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about the state of small business lending, we talked to Brock Blake, the CEO and founder of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendio.com\/\">Lendio<\/a>, a lending marketplace, to get his insights.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8555\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8555\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8555 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Brock-Blake-of-Lendio.jpg\" alt=\"Brock Blake of Lendio\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Brock-Blake-of-Lendio.jpg 686w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Brock-Blake-of-Lendio-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8555\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Brock Blake, Founder and CEO of Lendio<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Fundbox: In general, how would you rate the lending environment for small businesses today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: There\u2019s been a lot of talk of doom and gloom, but it\u2019s actually the opposite. There are lots of reason to be optimistic going into 2018. The metrics we see are positive. Small businesses are healthy, growing and repaying their loans. They\u2019re balancing providing great customer experience and focusing on delivering what consumers demand while managing the profitability of their businesses.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Businesses are more credit-worthy these days\u2014and we\u2019re seeing low default rates among those seeking capital. And there\u2019s also a lot of innovation on the lender side. There are great lenders, including newer players, online lenders, and traditional banks all innovating.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Small businesses have more options today, there are more loan products for different use cases as lenders focus on specific areas businesses are in.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">From a small business perspective, there\u2019s never been a better time to get access to capital. There are lots of lenders, more options, all competing to gain access to the customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Have advances in technology, like cloud computing, made a difference?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: Yes. Underwriters can look at data to access creditworthiness. Lenders are better able to customize their products. They\u2019re getting better at knowing certain industries, allowing lenders to focus on the wheelhouse of the customers they want to underwrite. If they stick to their sweet-spot, there\u2019s a lot of promise.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s an ecosystem of credit and loan opportunities for business owners available today. A landscape of products. But business owners need to be educated about them.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: I agree. Business owners\u2019 perceptions are a bank is a bank is a bank. If anyone is going to give me a loan it\u2019s my bank and [they apply] and get declined. They don\u2019t realize that bank only does one type of business loan. They think, \u201cI got declined, I\u2019ll get declined from everyone.\u201d They don\u2019t realize all the different types of funding products available. It\u2019s overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">But today, there\u2019s an \u201calways on\u201d application. For instance, in QuickBooks, a business owner can get an alert from them that they\u2019re prequalified [for a loan]. \u201cClick here, get $20,000.\u201d The business owner may not be seeking a loan, but they think, \u201cif I had the money\u2026that\u2019s interesting, I\u2019m going to pursue it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Money is being pushed, not pulled today. No one wants to apply for a loan and be declined. So, it\u2019s [better] for the entrepreneur and less risky for the lender.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are more business owners seeking capital?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: We see volume and demand continuing to increase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there specific types of businesses\/industries currently looking for funding?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: Retailers, in general, have more working capital needs. Restaurants too, as well as consumer-facing companies and seasonal businesses. There\u2019s more inconsistency around these businesses. But, small businesses across the board need money. On average, businesses need access to capital every three quarters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do small businesses have to be more in tune with being global companies?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: The internet changed everything. Just selling locally is not enough. Small businesses need to embrace digital marketing. They have to reach new audiences in ways that are highly compelling.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8556\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Lendio-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"Embrace digital marketing\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the most common reasons for SMBs to take out a loan? Our research shows there are $825 billion in unpaid invoices. And their needs are shifting. Most businesses are in need of cash flow management. Now, they\u2019re less worried about triaging. It\u2019s more about the future\u2014about hiring, digital marketing, etc.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: In 2018, businesses seeking capital are more forward-looking, rather than backward-looking. They\u2019re looking to generate opportunity. More are taking out a loan to hire, to expand, to open new channels, to increase marketing, to be more successful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are some common misconceptions small business owners have about getting a loan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: They think they\u2019re going to lose their house if they can\u2019t pay off the loan. The industry has tried to educate them, but they don\u2019t know what the personal guarantee means. Lenders are looking at personal credit scores. If they default, their personal credit will be affected, and there is a collection process, but that doesn\u2019t include taking your house.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the truth about startups? Do they have any chance of getting funded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: Startup money comes from friends, family and credit cards. Lenders need to see cash flow and most startups don\u2019t have that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">People fear credit cards, but many businesses only exist because they\u2019ve leveraged credit cards. Credit card advances are a good option. Look for the ones that are interest-free with 0 APR for the 1st\u00a0year. It\u2019s great money; you can get $10,000-$15,000, paying no interest for a year. It gives you runway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">But startups won\u2019t get funding if they have bad credit. So, don\u2019t overleverage yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What criteria do lending institutions (traditional and non-traditional) look for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: The three C\u2019s: credit score, cash flow and collateral. You used to need all three C\u2019s to get a loan, now you only need one of them to get funds. The more C\u2019s you have, the better the rate. If you have two or three, you\u2019ll get a medium capital rate; if you only have one, you\u2019ll pay a higher rate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Traditional lenders are not looking to lend to businesses with only one of the three C\u2019s. Some traditional lenders will just look at your credit score. Others have a \u201chard threshold\u201d about how long you\u2019ve been in business. They want to see evidence of cash flow, often for a minimum of one year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are most popular types of funding small businesses request?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: A line of credit is by far the most popular. It\u2019s what business owners know. They can draw on it when they want to, for what they want. They associate it with flexibility. We put out a marketing piece, testing one product vs. another. The line of credit got a 3-5 times bigger response.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are business owners smarter these days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">BB: Yes, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s data to back it up. We celebrate entrepreneurship in the U.S. more than we ever have. Small business is the backbone of the economy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Everyone\u2014the government, chambers of commerce, entrepreneurship centers, organizations\u2014are all asking how we can help small businesses be successful, and reduce the failure rate. How can we help small businesses get off the ground and start running? \u00a0Our culture is to believe in entrepreneurs. We want entrepreneurs to win.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>About Brock Blake:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brockblake\/\">Brock Blake<\/a>\u00a0is the Founder and CEO of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/lendio.com\/\">Lendio<\/a>, an online service that helps businesses find the right small business loan quickly.
