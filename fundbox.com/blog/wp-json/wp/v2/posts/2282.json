How do you keep your eye on the proverbial ball that are your important client relationships while completing the many other business tasks you handle in a day?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few cost-effective ways to stay in touch with your clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make every interaction relevant. <\/strong>Your customers struggle with a flooded inbox and overwhelming list of \u201cto do\u2019s\u201d&#8211; just like you. If you\u2019re going to invest the time to call or email a customer, spent a few extra moments to making it relevant. For example, establish a Google Alert for each client\u2019s name, their business name and alerts for the products and industries that pertain to your client relationships. These alerts will scan the Internet to ensure you\u2019re always aware of \u201cmentions\u201d relevant to your clients, and what\u2019s happening in their respective worlds. Incorporate the news into your \u201ctouch base\u201d to give more meaning and context to your message.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mimic their communication style. <\/strong>Your customers tell you how they want you to keep in touch, based on how they communicate with you. It\u2019s up to you to follow their lead. If your customer sends you email, don\u2019t call; email her back. If she contacts your business with a message on social media, respond to her in the same channel. If she leaves you a voicemail, return the phone call. If she texts, text back. (You get the hint). As common sense as it sounds, mimicking the kind of communication your customer uses is one of the simplest ways to demonstrate that you understand what your client wants and are willing to accommodate it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Automate interactions for consistency.<\/strong> If you want to realize a return on the time and financial investment you put into social media, email campaigns, and online review sites, you\u2019ve got to be consistent in your strategy. The problem? It\u2019s time-consuming!<\/p>\n<p>Though automated campaign management tools don\u2019t eliminate the need to invest at least a few hours a month into your client contact strategy, they greatly simplify the process. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/capzool.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Capzool<\/a> allows you to produce and preschedule blog content, press releases, email, mobile and voicemail campaigns, and promotional offers (including those delivered via email, social media, local review sites and paid advertising), all in one shot. Block some time in your schedule every couple of weeks to focus on what you want to say, when, how and to whom\u2014and let technology take care of the rest (until it\u2019s time for your next campaign).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give help with no strings attached. <\/strong>Instead of sending clients messages about products, offers or services that focus on your business, think of ways you can help them, no strings attached. Does your customer have a Yelp page, a Facebook business page, a LinkedIn profile or a Google+ presence? ? Leave a positive and genuine review about their skills, and the great things they have to offer. Don\u2019t announce that you\u2019ve left the review, or ask them to return the favor. Odds are, they\u2019ll notice, and remember what you did for them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Invite their insight. <\/strong>There is such a thing as being too close to your products and services. So close, in fact, that you become blind to the real reasons your clients need, want, and value your business. Before you release your next promotion or product launch, send your customers a quick email inviting them to share their opinions. Keep the survey brief, ask plenty of open-ended questions, and provide thought starters, so they understand what kind of insight you want. (Consider using a tool like Survey Monkey so clients can share feedback anonymously). At worst, they won\u2019t respond to your request. At best, you\u2019ll learn more about what they perceive as your true selling points and opportunities, and let them know their opinions matter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remember what few others know. <\/strong>Keeping notes about your client\u2019s children\u2019s names and ages, pets, and hobbies may sound like a trite technique, but in an era where face to face human interaction is so rare, old-fashioned relationship building can set you apart.<\/p>\n<p>Make the effort to truly listen to your clients. Take notes after you part ways and proactively set a calendar reminder to check in with them when it\u2019s appropriate, based on what they shared. If you meet with a client in May whose child will begin preschool in the fall, set a reminder to check in mid- September to see how those first few days went. Likewise, if your client will participate in a race or athletic event, schedule a reminder to attend, or simply send a good luck note the day before\u2014just to express that you truly heard them and care.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all the automated \u201cCRM\u201d tools that exist, taking the time to hear and get to know clients on a human level, can be one of the easiest and most impactful ways to stay in touch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Competition is fierce\u2014and time is limited.
