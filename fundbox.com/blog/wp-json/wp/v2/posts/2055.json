According to Capital One\u2019s latest<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/small-business\/credit-cards\/small-business-growth-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Small Business Growth Index<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/small-business\/credit-cards\/small-business-growth-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">64 percent of businesses view conditions as \u201cgood or excellent.\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimism aside, many businesses find their growth plans thwarted at every turn. Surprisingly, one of the biggest impediments to growth is the business itself. Many businesses simply aren\u2019t operationally ready for growth because a lack of skilled labor, poor hiring decisions, a lack of competitive intelligence, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you make your small business grow faster? What impacts the growth of small businesses? How do you finance growth?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a round-up of some of the most common barriers to growth and steps you can take to break through them as you look to capitalize on key <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/2021-small-business-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small business trends for 2021<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Ignoring Business Indicators<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone wants revenue growth, but what form will it take and are you ready to grow in that area? Study your business indicators regularly to monitor growth opportunities. This includes your sales pipeline, conversion rates, and market trends.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things to look out for include success in one market or location and the potential to expand into another. Is a big sales deal on the horizon? Is your pipeline trending favorably? Is success in one area of product development opening new doors of opportunity for others?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Overlooking the Competition<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition can be a great driver for growth if you approach it correctly. There\u2019s no point making it your mission to be better than the competition if you don\u2019t have a deep knowledge of where you stand against them. A powerful tool for doing this is a simple <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/resource\/swot-analysis-worksheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT stands for \u201cStrengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats.\u201d A SWOT analysis can help you identify what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and where to concentrate your energies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Forgetting About People Until It\u2019s Too Late<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite record high unemployment rates, a lack of skills and abilities remains a major concern. Today, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/lifestyle\/businesses-continue-to-struggle-to-find-qualified-talent-despite-millions-of-individuals-looking-to-re-enter-the-workforce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 percent of organizations report that they have been negatively impacted by talent scarcity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To grow you need to surround yourself with great people. Always be on the lookout for talent. Build a stable of independent contractors who can get to know your business well and contribute on an as-needed basis. Once you\u2019re ready to grow they can step in with minimal ramp-up and help you meet your goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option comes in the form of mentors. Having someone beside you who\u2019s been there before as you enter new territory can be invaluable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Not Accounting for Risk Early in the Growth Phase<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small business growth doesn\u2019t come without risk. As you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/create-a-business-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plan your growth strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, have a \u201cPlan B\u201d in place that accounts for any hurdles along the way that might impede growth. Things like hiring problems, manufacturing issues, unexpected expenses, cash flow challenges, patent infringements, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go back to your SWOT analysis and identify these risks or threats and think about ways you can fix or get around them. These are also good conversations to have with your mentor as well as your accountant and\/or lawyer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Failing to Plan for Cash Flow Issues<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With growth comes extra cost. If your outgoings are more than your income, even for a short period, paying your bills gets difficult. In fact, cash flow issues are one of the\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most common reasons why small businesses fail<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/5-ways-to-fix-common-cash-flow-problems-before-its-too-late\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0close their doors for this reason.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To preserve cash flow while growing your business, you may need access to funding. But take time to consider which loan types make sense for you because not all are created equal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you\u2019re looking to fund expansion or need an injection of cash during unpredictable operating cycles you may want to explore a\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can get set up a line of credit before you need it and only pay for the funds you use. Lines of credit are revolving, and monthly payments don\u2019t kick in until you dip into the cash.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is a term loan. This gives you access to a set amount of money with a specific repayment schedule. Term loans often have low interest rates and provides the funding for small business growth initiatives such as opening a new location, upgrading equipment, purchasing vehicles, or remodeling your space. With a term loan funding your growth you can preserve your cash flow for other areas of your business such as payroll.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>To make planning work for your business, you should revisit it as you grow.
