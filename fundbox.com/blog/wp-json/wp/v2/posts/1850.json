It\u2019s a tedious exercise that most of us would rather tackle once a year or put off until we\u2019re sat in front of a lender asking for financing only to find out they need solid justification in writing.<\/p>\n<p>But business planning shouldn\u2019t be avoided and is certainly shouldn\u2019t be a burden.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re starting a new business or planning your next quarter, you need a plan for realizing your goals. The good news is that planning doesn\u2019t have to involve an encyclopedic output of paper \u2013 not if you plan as you go and break the process into chunks.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus on Planning and Less on the \u201cPlan\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\nPerhaps you\u2019re a freelancer or a growing employee-based business. Either way, you need a sense of where your business is going:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s your market?<\/li>\n<li>How will you capitalize on the market opportunity?<\/li>\n<li>What will it take to get there?<\/li>\n<li>How much money will you need?<\/li>\n<li>How will you maintain cash flow as you execute against the plan?<\/li>\n<li>What are your benchmarks for success?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, none of this is a one-off process. To make planning work for your business, you need to revisit as you grow. In that way, it\u2019s less about the plan and more about planning.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s an informal community of players coming together once or twice a month. Are you still on course? Generating a return? Do you need to steer the ship in another direction?<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on the exercise and less on the output, your plan becomes useful and infinitely more dynamic than that one time document that you burnt the midnight oil creating for your bank manager.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Break the Planning Process into Chunks<\/strong><br \/>\nThe next step in simplifying the planning process is to break it down.<\/p>\n<p>Small business owners wear many hats, one minute we\u2019re planning our IT strategy and the next we\u2019re weighing up how we\u2019re going to invest our marketing dollars. Realistically, you can\u2019t possibly do it all at once, and the same goes for planning.<\/p>\n<p>So review your overall business goals and then think about how each function of your business can help achieve those goals. For this, you\u2019ll need mini-plans \u2013 one for marketing, one for IT, one for operations, one for sales, one for staffing, and so on. If you have plans for growth overseas or into a new market, you\u2019ll need a separate plan for that too. Set a budget, goals and measurables for each mini-plan and revisit them once a week.<\/p>\n<p><em>Follow these approaches and you\u2019ll soon see that business planning is not as insurmountable as you might think.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Business planning \u2013 urgh!
