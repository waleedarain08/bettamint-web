However, using revenue and cash flow alone, he had to wait until reserves increased before he could hire. That\u2019s when he started looking for a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_content=blog_fluxaccounting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business line of credit<\/a>, to get away from this cyclical dilemma.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-13740 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/ChaseVowellBW.jpg\" alt=\"Chase Vowell of Flux Accounting\" width=\"242\" height=\"363\" style=\"width:242px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an avid QuickBooks user, he looked at the QuickBooks App Store for some ideas. That\u2019s when he found Fundbox. Fundbox integrated into QuickBooks and had good reviews, so he decided to give it a try. \u201cI remember onboarding being really easy. The setup with QuickBooks was seamless,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once he was approved and started using Fundbox he was impressed. \u201cThe interface is extremely user friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheer transparency is phenomenal, which is rare,\u201d he added. As the leader of an accounting firm, he also cared about the QuickBooks integration. A lot. \u201cI specifically appreciate the way that you can use Fundbox inside of QuickBooks. The integration is really clean.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best thing for Chase and Flux Accounting is the impact that Fundbox has had on his business. \u201cWe\u2019re now able to hire much earlier, so by the time we hit a busy period, our employees have already been trained and our clients don\u2019t see a lapse in service.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solutions like Fundbox are where Chase sees his practice moving in the future. \u201cThis is the future of cloud accounting,\u201d he explained. \u201cEverything ties to the accounting platform and you cut down on the manual work, so you can focus on the value-add consultation with your clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><a
