It\u2019s helpful to have different skills than your partner\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ideal business partner is someone who can complement your strengths <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compensate for your shortcomings. That\u2019s why choosing a partner with different skills than you is key, said Michael Alexis, the CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/teambuilding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team Building<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a company that offers virtual team building activities to businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy business partner has a strong mind toward the creative and operational aspects of the business, whereas my strengths are marketing, sales, and growth,\u201d he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having different talents and areas of expertise doesn\u2019t just improve your company\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> potential, it can also prevent conflict or competition between you and your partner. After all, when you\u2019re working on different areas of the business, you won\u2019t be stepping on one another\u2019s toes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your communication styles need to align<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/10-ways-to-avoid-friction-in-a-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear, open communication<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the key to a healthy, long-lasting business partnership. Before you go into business with someone, make sure you discuss your communication style and preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That includes talking about how you make decisions, how you approach conflict, and when and how often you\u2019d like to check in with one another, said Michelle Diamond, the CEO and founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elevatediamondstrategy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elevate Diamond Strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a firm that advises businesses on their growth strategy and development.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people like to touch base multiple times a day, while others prefer a weekly catch-up call. Agreeing on a communication strategy early on can help prevent confusion and conflict down the road. \u201cDirect communication is key. If someone is blindsided, emotions get involved,\u201d Diamond said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Contracts are essential<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a good rapport with your business partner only gets you so far. To prevent problems, it\u2019s critical to draw up a contract that spells out your roles, responsibilities, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">profit sharing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou have to be very upfront with who is going to do what,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t account for every single thing that\u2019s going to occur, but you should still discuss important matters to the extent that you can.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the following questions:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will you split profits?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will your respective salaries look like?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your business deal-breakers?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will your equity strategy be?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you bring on additional partners?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is your process for making big company decisions?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is each partner\u2019s role and day-to-day duties?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will happen if the partnership <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/buy-out-your-business-partner\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dissolves<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will happen if one partner dies or decides to leave the business?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. It\u2019s important to have the same goals for the business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you and your partner don\u2019t share the same long-term vision for the company, you risk dealing with mounting stress and discord as your company grows.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou can\u2019t be successful if you\u2019re not on the same page,\u201d said Diamond.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alexis agreed, and said it\u2019s helpful to consider why you and your partner want to own a business together. \u201cIt\u2019s a red flag for me if someone wants image or wealth out of a business,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to work with someone who has a similar passion for the mission.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to discussing your values and interests, make sure you have an open conversation about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/spring-cleaning-business-partnership\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your goals for the company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, monetary and otherwise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Business acumen isn\u2019t the most important factor<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re searching for a business partner, it\u2019s important to look beyond someone\u2019s resume.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou have to consider emotional intelligence and personality in addition to business acumen,\u201d Diamond said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How well your partner can solve problems, execute ideas, and handle conflict has a huge effect on your business\u2019s success.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen times are good, a business is relatively easy to manage,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cHowever, when margins are thin or the business goes into the negative is when an entrepreneur\u2019s ability to handle adversity really shows.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with someone who\u2019s resilient, positive, and hard-working in the face of hardship can help you navigate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-disaster-prep\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crises<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and slow periods with ease, Alexis said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Trust your gut<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good idea to gather as much information as possible when preparing for a business partnership, but ultimately, your best source of intel is your own intuition. \u201cYou have to listen to your gut,\u201d said Diamond.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t feel 100% right about a business partnership at the beginning, it may not be wise to move forward, she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to choose a business partner just as carefully as you\u2019d choose a romantic partner, Alexis said. \u201cThis could be someone you spend the rest of your life working with, so don\u2019t go into it loosely.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Small business partnerships can be harmonious, mutually beneficial relationships that help propel your business forward.
