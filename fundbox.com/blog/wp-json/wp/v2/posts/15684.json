Let\u2019s look at what a business loan cosigner does and the pros and cons of having one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What does a cosigner do?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many financial institutions consider small businesses a high-risk investment due to their lack of credit history and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.advocacy.sba.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/24153946\/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2019-1.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high failure rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As such they may require a cosigner on the loan. It\u2019s a serious obligation. A cosigner doesn\u2019t just cosign your loan, the lender can require them to repay it \u2013 and any associated late fees, fines, and penalties \u2013 if you default.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to helping you secure a loan, using a cosigner may improve your chances of getting a favorable interest rates, flexible repayment terms, or access to more funds. A small business loan cosigner can also mitigate the need for you to put up <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/can-i-get-a-small-business-loan-without-collateral\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">collateral<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to get a cosigner\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cosigner is typically someone with excellent credit history or significant assets (since they may be required to provide collateral such as property, in exchange for financing). Ideally, that individual is someone you trust, such as a family member or friend.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosigning services are available from organizations or professionals for a fee but should always be approached with caution and the terms of the services closely scrutinized.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, you\u2019ll need to make a compelling case to secure a cosigner.

Once you\u2019ve identified that person, they will complete the loan application process alongside you. Once approved, the cosigner must accept and sign the loan agreement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What are the risks of having a cosigner on your loan?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cosigner doesn\u2019t pose any risks to you or your business. However, if you fail to keep up with loan repayments and the bank calls on your cosigner to pay, then it could seriously damage your relationship \u2013 especially if your cosigner is a family member or friend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also consider how your cosigner\u2019s credit score might impact your ability to secure a loan, the amount the bank will approve, and the lending terms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What to do if you can\u2019t find a cosigner<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cosigning is risky and not for everyone. If you\u2019re concerned that your credit score may impact your chances of being approved for a small business loan, there are alternatives to entering into a cosigned loan agreement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Improve your business credit score:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It takes time, but actions such as making timely payments, paying off debt, and maintaining a low credit utilization ratio can help improve your credit score and chances of a successful loan application.

Unlike other forms of financing, you don\u2019t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you use.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to a business line of credit quickly and with relatively little administrative work. For example, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can apply online and get a credit decision in minutes. Unlike a traditional business loan application, you won\u2019t have to complete any paperwork to get started. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there\u2019s no impact to your credit score just for applying.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider an SBA loan: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a variety of small business loans that are partly guaranteed by the government. This makes them a useful option for small business owners who otherwise wouldn\u2019t qualify for financing.

Weigh up other financing options first. If you determine you could benefit from a cosigned loan, apply for a smaller amount, and pay it off diligently. This will help improve your business credit score and boost your chances of getting a business loan the next time you need funds \u2013 without the need for collateral or a cosigner. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Caron Beesley If you\u2019re in the process of applying for a small business loan, you may find yourself in &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":15195,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11547,426],"yst_prominent_words":[723,1721,1139,1707,1706,1704,739,1142,3064,1529,3030,2046,4192,712,1705],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-left-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Find a Cosigner for a Small Business Loan | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"by Caron Beesley If you\u2019re in the process of applying for a small business loan, you may find yourself in the situation where you need to find a cosigner for the loan.\u00a0 But what does a cosigner do, how do you find one, and what\u2019s involved?
