Why do I use my own name? I didn&#8217;t want to use the creative talent that I deploy for clients on a clever business moniker. I also want to make it clear that I personally stand behind the work I do. When clients engage me, they get a communications consultant and a writer, but they also get Elea Carey.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can you describe your business in a few words?<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a deeply embedded communications consultant who works alongside clients on a daily basis, helping them carefully craft the ways they &#8220;talk&#8221; to their audiences.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I write blogs and speeches, tweets and take-one brochures. I work with clients on the voicemails they leave and the sales phone calls they make.<\/p>\n<p>More broadly, I consult on their events and social gatherings\u2014who should be in those rooms, what makes their time memorable\u2014and I help them craft long-term strategic plans about how they will communicate and connect with audiences in years to come. I also manage a team of freelancers who support clients with written content, editing, and social media tactics that converge with larger objectives.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What\u2019s your driving purpose? Why do you do what you do each day?<\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s become central to my purpose to spend my time with people I respect and enjoy, and to find ways to support them that are exciting in the short run and successful over the long haul.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These principles abide in my home life and my work, so I wake up looking forward to spending hours with my clients and then coming home to my family with the many fruits of the day.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Do you have a personal business philosophy? What principles to you use to run your business successfully?<\/h3>\n<p>I find great comfort and success in a thought from Alcoholics Anonymous, of which I&#8217;m an active member: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Just do the next right thing<\/span>. So while I&#8217;m able to help clients see the future and think strategically about it, I can also simply focus on next steps without getting overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What do you most wish you knew when you started your business&#8230;and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I wish I had known that writing was not editing, and that typing is not writing. The meta view of that is: I wasted a lot of time and energy beating myself up for small mistakes while not taking credit for significant strategic thinking (for which, it turns out, I have a gift). I now concentrate on what I&#8217;m good at and subcontract the areas where I don&#8217;t excel.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What challenges have Fundbox (and convenient access to funding) helped you solve?<\/h3>\n<p>If I include watching my father and grandfather manage their own businesses, I can say I&#8217;ve got about a 40-year perspective on small business funding issues, and wow have they changed. I self-funded my own efforts successfully until I had strong clients in place.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What I didn&#8217;t expect was that, even with great clients, there would be invoicing delays. With my giant institutional clients, those delays are because of bureaucracy. Most of my smaller clients don&#8217;t have a steady paying rhythm. Fundbox has helped me easily bridge those gaps.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>Find more about Elea Carey and her work at <a href=\"https:\/\/wellwritten.co\/\">wellwritten.com<\/a>.
