Still, Opening Day means the same thing every year: a fresh start, as all 30 teams have the identical, unblemished 0-0 record.<\/p>\n<p>We figure you might be stuck at the office wishing you were at the ballpark today. While we can\u2019t help you there, we can help you think about baseball while also thinking about growing your business. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three baseball-related tips from MLB\u2019s Opening Day that can benefit your business:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Don\u2019t dwell on past failures.<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s never fun to fail. But learning from those failures is critical if you plan on succeeding in the future. The 20 MLB teams that didn\u2019t make the playoffs last year have their sights set on October 2015, not October 2014. Instead of reliving what went wrong last year, they\u2019ve spent the offseason and spring training working on their mechanics and trying to get better. You can\u2019t win them all, but you can prepare yourself to do your best the next time you step to the plate.<\/p>\n<p>In the business world, sometimes failure can produce amazing unintended results. Case in point: the Post-It note. Believe it or not, the classic note paper was created completely by accident. Working for 3M in 1968, Spencer Silver was charged with the task of building <a href=\"http:\/\/www.todayifoundout.com\/index.php\/2011\/11\/post-it-notes-were-invented-by-accident\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a super strong adhesive to be used in the airplane manufacturing process<\/a>. He failed spectacularly, inventing a weak adhesive that didn\u2019t leave a mark when it was peeled off a surface. Nearly 50 years later, it\u2019s pretty evident that Silver\u2019s failure was a very successful one for 3M.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) You can never count the underdog out.<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile there might be a leader in your industry that consistently dominates all relevant categories each year, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that proves these juggernauts don\u2019t win <em>all <\/em>the time. Most people probably didn\u2019t think the Kansas City Royals had a shot at the American League pennant last year, but somehow they wound up in the World Series (losing, of course, to our beloved San Francisco Giants).<\/p>\n<p>Seven years ago, Google Chrome didn\u2019t exist (it was released in September 2008). Today, it\u2019s America\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gettingmoreawesome.com\/2012\/08\/20\/how-google-chrome-became-the-1-browser\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most popular browser<\/a> (though Google is certainly no longer an underdog). Similarly, your business doesn\u2019t have to settle for being the second best. As underdogs have proven time and time again, they\u2019re perfectly capable of stealing the spotlight and thriving on the main stage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) No one knows who this year\u2019s World Series winner will be.<\/strong><br \/>\nWe\u2019d be lying if we said we didn\u2019t want the Giants to win their <a href=\"http:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2014\/10\/san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-7-bumgarner-mlb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fourth title in six years<\/a> this fall. But the season\u2019s just begun, and as today\u2019s standings indicate, all teams have an equal shot at a World Series title, regardless of what\u2019s happened in the past.<\/p>\n<p>If your business hasn\u2019t yet won its proverbial World Series ring in some time, don\u2019t sweat it: This year could very well be yours. All you need to do is show up to the park every day and give it your all.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Major League Baseball will kick off the 2015 season, today, April 6th\u2014a week later than the first games were held &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":1412,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72],"yst_prominent_words":[4664,4669,4665,723,4666,4668,3037,4663,4667,4662,4671,4095,4670,4589,3300,4593,4661,1522,3503,4660],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"3 Small Business Takeaways from MLB\u2019s Opening Day","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Major League Baseball will kick off the 2015 season on April 6\u2014a week later than the first games were held last year.
