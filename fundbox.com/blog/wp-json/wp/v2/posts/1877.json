Effective content strategies leverage tools like blog posts, videos, social media, and infographics to connect with target audiences, stimulate the conversation and social sharing that deepens relationships, and increases brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>Though producing these tools takes an investment of time, thought, and energy, most content is highly accessible and affordable, even to small businesses with limited resources.<\/p>\n<p>Now for the downside of content marketing\u2026it\u2019s popular. There\u2019s quite a bit of competition for attention among audiences who are hammered with messages, day and night.<\/p>\n<p>Much like the adage about whether a tree that falls in an empty forest is heard, your content marketing strategy is only effective when it cuts through the noise, and reaches your intended audience.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t create content that gets noticed. But it does help to know a few tricks to reduce the odds that your hard work falls on deaf ears.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be original. <\/strong> There are about <a href=\"http:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ranking-factors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">200 factors Google considers as part of its algorithm<\/a> to determine the content it considers relevant enough to recommend.<\/p>\n<p>Though familiarizing yourself with the technical details behind Google\u2019s latest algorithm (which changes frequently) certainly won\u2019t hurt your efforts, you don\u2019t have to be technical to create content that will be viewed favorably by the search engines. Be original, relevant, and informative. Steer clear of the tired page rank trickery like keyword-stuffing. Avoid the emails you receive for \u201cguest post\u201d offers offering to create free content for your site, in exchange for a backlink. If Google suspects you\u2019re part of either kind of arrangement, your site\u2019s page rank could be penalized.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be thoughtful<\/strong>. Though creating interesting and appealing content is an undertaking, it\u2019s worth investing time into\u2014mainly because the amount of media \u201cnoise\u201d in tandem with Google\u2019s algorithms all but guarantee the content you churn you churn out in minutes won\u2019t drive any real business results.<\/p>\n<p>But with that in mind, quality is in the eye of the beholder. High-value content tells your audience something they don\u2019t know, want to know more about or discuss, or puts a new spin on an old idea. It educates, informs, demonstrates, or inspires through games, tools, \u201chow to\u201d posts, videos and podcasts, product reviews, profiles, timely news reports, and interviews with industry movers and shakers. Experiment with different tactics and measure the activity they generate. Eventually, you\u2019ll find what sticks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Know your audience<\/strong>. Relationships that always involve generic small talk don\u2019t tend to evolve in \u201creal life.\u201d The same is true of your online content. Before you start talking, find out what you\u2019re audience cares about. <a href=\"http:\/\/tools.seobook.com\/firefox\/seo-for-firefox.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEOBook provides a handy tool<\/a> for Firefox and Google users that monitors page rank and lets you research which keywords bode well for your competitors. Google\u2019s free Keyword Planner tool can help you identify the keywords and phrases your desired audience uses to search for businesses like yours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be timely.<\/strong> Productive content marketing demands that you plan\u2014and react\u2014strategically. Create an editorial calendar to establish a production and publishing cadence. It can simplify your internal processes, focus your efforts, and give your audience of a sense of when they\u2019ll hear from you. But be willing to veer from your calendar when your audience is talking about other news. Establish Google Alerts for relevant keywords so you can gauge opportunities to create content that supports those conversations while they\u2019re happening.<\/p>\n<p>Subscribe to free tools like Reddit, BuzzSumo, and Alltop. All make it easy to search by topic and keyword and are great places to find inspiration for creating content that is relevant, timely&#8211;and extends beyond the obvious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be easy to digest.<\/strong> There is no hard and fast rule around content length, but some evidence suggests that established sites with longer articles (about 1,500 words) now tend to \u201cearn\u201d more page rank credibility than short posts (of 400 words or less). But there are far more content options than the written word\u2014including video, podcasts, images, and infographics. Ultimately, the medium <em>your <\/em>audience prefers and can easily digest should dictate your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>That may mean producing multiple content types like a longer form blog post, an infographic, and a short video\u2014all on the same topic. Test which mediums perform best on different publishing platforms, and among which audiences. As you experiment, monitor, and measure, you\u2019ll learn how your content is best received, and where.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Content marketing has become a popular buzzword for good reason.
