Marketing data<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without consistent, strategic marketing, your business\u2019s growth can stall. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to regularly review your marketing metrics to see what you\u2019re doing right\u2014and what you can improve upon. Here are three areas to focus on:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Website analytics: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business website is full of valuable information about your marketing tactics. When you look at the analytics, pay attention to the total number of visits per month, the amount of pages visited, and the website bounce rate, which indicates how quickly visitors leave your site. It\u2019s also smart to analyze your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-boost-blog-traffic-budget-2\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website traffic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sources\u2014like email, organic search, and social channels\u2014so you can see which distribution channels are bringing in the most traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Social media analytics: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying active on social media is a good way to brand your business and attract new customers. On each of your business accounts, make sure you record the number of followers you have, as well as the amount of likes, comments, clicks, and shares your content gets on each platform. The more engagement your content has, the better your visibility and post reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Email analytics: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating tailored email marketing campaigns is one of the most effective ways to get in front of current and potential customers. Whether your business sends out email newsletters, promotions, or transactional messages (or all three), it\u2019s important to track your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-ways-boost-email-open-conversion-rates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email open rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Knowing how often subscribers open your messages is the first step to figuring out how to tweak your emails for better engagement. You should also look at your email list growth rate and click-through rate, which show how often new people subscribe and click the links in your emails.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Financial data\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your finances are the foundation of your entire operation. Getting familiar with your financial data doesn\u2019t just give you a better idea of your company\u2019s overall profitability, it can also make it easier to budget properly, maintain healthy cash flow, and hit your sales and revenue targets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You and your business accountant should carve out time each month to look at your income statement, balance sheet, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow statement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but it\u2019s also worth tracking the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Expenses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business expenses can reveal a lot about your company\u2019s operational efficiency and cash flow. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/fixed-expenses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which include costs like rent, employee salaries, and insurance, stay the same from month to month, while variable expenses fluctuate. Examples of variable costs include inventory, utilities, and marketing and advertising. Tallying up your fixed and variable expenses will tell you how much it costs to run your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Net profit margin: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your net profit margin shows how much of your business\u2019s revenue translates to profit. To calculate it, start by figuring out your net income using this formula: <\/span><b>Net income = Sales\/Revenue &#8211; Cost of goods sold &#8211; Expenses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From there, you can calculate your net profit margin percentage: <\/span><b>Net profit margin = (Net income \/ Total sales) x 100<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your net profit margin is low, you may want to consider\u00a0 increasing\u00a0 your revenue by selling more, raising your prices, or cutting expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Revenue growth: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revenue growth is a good indicator of how steadily your business is growing. Looking at how your revenue changes from month to month or quarter to quarter can help you make more accurate sales forecasts. To calculate your revenue growth, use this formula: <\/span><b>Revenue growth percentage = (Current period\u2019s revenue &#8211; Last period\u2019s revenue) \/ (Last period\u2019s revenue x 100)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Customer experience data\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying competitive comes down to improving your business\u2019s customer experience. Analyzing customer experience data is key to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drawing new customers in<\/span><\/a> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> satisfying the ones you already have. Here are a few metrics to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Customer retention rates: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retention rates show you how many customers you\u2019re maintaining, while churn rates show you how many customers you\u2019re losing. Rather than looking at your retention and churn rates in isolation, consider what\u2019s normal for your industry, then look at how your rates change over a period of time. If you\u2019re consistently losing customers, you may need to examine your products, adjust your pricing, or evaluate your customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Customer reviews:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Customer reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide valuable qualitative data about your customers\u2019 likes and dislikes. Pay attention to your total customer reviews, your average rating, and the amount of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in the feedback you get.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Net promoter scores: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A net promoter score (NPS) is a simple, effective way to measure your customers\u2019 satisfaction with your business. You can send out email surveys to figure out your company\u2019s NPS or install a website pop-up asking customers to rank their experience on a scale of one to 10.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Sales data\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to understand your sales metrics and results in order to refine your sales strategies and reach your quotas. Start by looking at the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Qualified leads: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualified leads are the people most likely to become your customers. Tracking the number of qualified leads your business has is a good way to determine whether or not you\u2019re targeting the right markets. You can assess qualified leads by counting the number of people who visited your website, added a product to their cart, or clicked a link in one of your emails.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Lead to conversion rate: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead to conversion rate, which shows how often <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/turn-warm-prospects-hot-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">qualified leads turn into paying customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, can tell you how effective your sales strategies are. You can calculate the conversion rate using this formula: <\/span><b>Conversion rate = (Total number of new customers \/ Total number of leads) x 100<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From there, you can work on improving conversion by retraining your sales team or adjusting your sales funnel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Yearly sales growth rate:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Looking at your annual sales growth rate gives you a better idea of how your business is progressing from year to year\u2014and what you can do to improve. The formula is: <\/span><b>Yearly sales growth rate = (Current year\u2019s sales &#8211; Last year\u2019s sales) \/ (Last year\u2019s sales x 100)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get ahead with data<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evaluating data is a powerful way to see into your business\u2019s future, but you need the right <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/moving-business-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do it. Website analytics platforms, customer relationship management software, and accounting software make it easy to track tons of different business metrics. Plus, certain platforms and tools generate weekly and monthly data reports.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter which method you choose, though, it\u2019s important to track a variety of metrics over a significant period of time. One data point doesn\u2019t tell much of a story, but data from a handful of different areas can paint a more complete picture of your business\u2019s health and growth potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intuition and experience are valuable assets when you\u2019re running a business, but they aren\u2019t enough to achieve impressive growth\u2014you also &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":83,"featured_media":15549,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[10410,21],"tags":[72],"yst_prominent_words":[723,713,4252,2945,1179,10620,1330,4258,1944,3294],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-right-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"4 Types of Business Data to Start Monitoring for Growth | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Gathering and analyzing data is key to solving problems, making more informed business decisions, and setting yourself up for steady growth."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"4 Types of Business Data to Start Monitoring for Growth | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Gathering and analyzing data is key to solving problems, making more informed business decisions, and setting yourself up for steady growth."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/monitor-business-growth\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shutterstock_1997566553.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shutterstock_1997566553.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Gathering and analyzing data is key to solving problems, making more informed business decisions, and setting yourself up for steady growth."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"4 Types of Business Data to Start Monitoring for Growth | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/shutterstock_1997566553.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/monitor-business-growth\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15545"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/83"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15545"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15545\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15548,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15545\/revisions\/15548"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/15549"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15545"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15545"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15545"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=15545"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
