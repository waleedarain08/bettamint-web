He decided to set up a boutique information technology practice in central Ohio,\u00a0and his firm has been heralded by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the best in the nation in information technology.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Low overhead, high client satisfaction<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Maintaining a low overhead is a core principle to Brian\u2019s business model. He wants his tech clients to take advantage of his expertise, and not stress out over the fees. That means he manages most of his practice in the cloud, eliminating paperwork and electronically tracking and scheduling billing records.<\/p>\n<p>Brian chose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clio.com\">Clio<\/a> as his practice management solution because he felt the service was more robust, easier to use and had a more attractive price point than its competitors. It also came highly recommended by his state bar association.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cClio could basically help me manage the business side of my practice without the use of personnel,\u201d Brian says.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Seamless integration with Fundbox<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Brian knew one of his firm\u2019s main challenges would be collecting from clients in an efficient manner.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cYou give clients a certain length of time to pay, but the problem is that you still are racking up expenses,\u201d he says. \u201cThe cash flow is uneven because the payments don\u2019t always come in exactly when you want.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Brian turned to Fundbox, a service that advances payments on outstanding invoices for a small fee &#8212; and seamlessly integrates with Clio. He started employing Fundbox to manage his cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s very nice is the way the two services interface,\u201d he says. \u201cClio handles my billing records, time entries, receivables, work in progress and invoices. That information is shared on the backend with Fundbox, which makes it easy for me to go into the service and smooth out cash flow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brian found Fundbox to be a better alternative than going to a financial institution and setting up a line of credit. He really liked what he called the \u201ccontrol factor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI thought the entire design was seamless,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was easy to set up; it was very clear what was going on. There weren\u2019t a lot of steps you had to take to sign up.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Managing inconsistency<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Brian finds Fundbox particularly helpful when dealing with clients whose <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers\/\">payments are unpredictable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have a very large company as a client, but its invoice payments are a bit inconsistent,\u201d he explains. \u201cSometimes the client could pay in 15 days and sometimes 90 days. You can\u2019t get upset with them because they\u2019re large, they have their own account payable practices, and you know they will pay, you just don\u2019t know when.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brian relies on Fundbox to provide the cash to keep his services up and running in the meantime.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI think that is the biggest advantage with evening out the time when clients pay their invoices,\u201d he says. \u201cFundbox is very good at smoothing that out.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And because he\u2019s not burdened with tracking cash flow, Brian has more time to do something he loves &#8212; he teaches at Kent State.<\/p>\n<p>Brian recommends that colleagues sign up for Clio and Fundbox even before opening the door at a law practice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a cost-conscious practice that depends on the cloud to be competitive, these two solutions are great,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p><em>Do you use Clio? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clio.com\/app-directory\/fundbox\/\">Check out the Fundbox integration in the Clio App Directory<\/a> to quickly apply for and manage your business credit with Fundbox.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You can\u2019t run one of America\u2019s best law firms without being innovative.
