IRS Publication 463 defines travel expenses as \u201cThe ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home for your business, profession, or job.\u00a0 An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your business. An expense does not have to be required to be considered necessary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Traveling Away from Home<\/strong><br \/>\nTo be considered \u201ctraveling away from home,\u201d you must be away from the general area of your tax home (The city or general area where you have a business.) longer than an ordinary day\u2019s work and\/or you\u2019ll need to sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away from home.\u00a0 You do not need to be gone for a whole day or from dusk to dawn.\u00a0 If your relief from duty is long enough to get the rest you need, it\u2019s permissible under IRS guidelines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What You Can Deduct<\/strong><br \/>\nHere are some examples of the travel expenses as defined in Table 1-1 of IRS Publication 463 that can be deducted:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transportation.<\/strong>\u00a0 This includes travel by airplane, train, bus or car between your home and your business destination.\u00a0 Free tickets or tickets that were awarded as part of a frequent traveler program cannot be considered.\u00a0 Your transportation cost will be considered $0.\u00a0 Traveling by ship carries its own set of rules and limits.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taxi, Commuter Bus, and Airport Limousine<\/strong>.\u00a0 The fares for these modes of transportation can be deducted if they took you from the airport or station to your hotel or the hotel or work location of your customers or clients, business meeting place or temporary work location.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Baggage and Shipping.<\/strong> If you need to send baggage, samples or display materials between your regular and temporary work locations, the cost is deductible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Car.\u00a0<\/strong> If your car is operated and maintained while traveling from home on business, you can deduct actual expenses or a standard mileage rate.\u00a0 You can also deduct business-related tolls and parking.\u00a0 If you rent a vehicle, you can only deduct the business-use portion of the expenses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lodging and Meals.<\/strong>\u00a0 The food, beverages, taxes, and tips that you paid for while traveling on business can be deducted if it was overnight or long enough for you to stop and sleep to perform your duties.\u00a0 Lavish meals are subjected to some rules, however.\u00a0 The IRS recommends using the \u201cstandard meal allowance\u201d method for deductions.\u00a0 You set an amount for your daily meals and incidental expenses (M&amp;IE) rather than deducting actual costs.\u00a0 You must keep records to prove the time, place, and business purpose of your travel.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dry Cleaning and Laundry.<\/strong>\u00a0 You need to look your best to meet with customers or clients so it\u2019s a given that these expenses are deductible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Telephone.\u00a0<\/strong> Any business calls placed while on your business trip fall under the category of deductible.\u00a0 That includes communication by fax machine or other communication devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tips.\u00a0<\/strong> Any tip that you pay for the expenses listed here.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Other.<\/strong>\u00a0 Transportation to and from a business meal, public stenographer\u2019s fees, computer rental fees, and even operating and maintaining a house trailer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Make the most of your travel-related deductions today.\u00a0 Now that you know which ones the IRS permits you to take, you\u2019ll lessen your tax liability and enjoy out-of-town meetings even more.\u00a0 To learn even
