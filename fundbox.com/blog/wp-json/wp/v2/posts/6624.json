And why is it important to your business\u2019s financial success? Here\u2019s a closer look.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Accounting Equation is a Balancing Act<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Double-entry accounting requires a clear understanding of the accounting equation because it is the foundation of your company\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/balance-sheet-income-statement\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balance sheet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which expresses your business\u2019s assets, liabilities, and owner\u2019s\/shareholder\u2019s equity in detail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While very small or simple businesses can sometimes make single-entry accounting work, everyone else is wise to use the double-entry accounting\u2014in part because it has error-avoidance built right in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The accounting equation formula is: <\/span><b><i>Assets = Liabilities + Owners\u2019 or Stockholders\u2019 Equity.<\/i><\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This equation contains three of the five so called &#8220;accounting elements&#8221;\u2014assets, liabilities, equity. The remaining two elements, revenue and expenses, are still important (and you still need to track them) because they indicate how much money you are bringing in and how much you are spending. However, revenue and expenses are not part of the accounting equation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Are Assets, Liability and Equity?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the purpose of calculating the results of the accounting equation, it is important to correctly define assets, liabilities and equity. The definitions are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Assets: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An asset is anything your business owns outright. This includes tangible assets (e.g. receivables, inventory, equipment, vehicles and real estate), intangible assets (intellectual property, like a patent, a copyright, or a trademark \u2014 is an example of an intangible asset) and cash.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Liabilities: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A liability is a financial obligation your business is required to meet. Some liabilities involve debt, while others are simply a part of your essential business operations. Examples of liabilities include wages, taxes, and credit card and\/or lease payments. Liabilities due within 12 months are considered short term, or current, liabilities. Long-term liabilities have due dates that are at least 12 months out.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Owners\u2019 Equity or Stockholders\u2019 Equity: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to be confused with the value of the business, this piece of the accounting equation refers to the percentage of the business that belongs to you or, in the case of a corporation, to stockholders. In terms of the accounting equation, owner\u2019s equity is sometimes expressed as assets minus liabilities. In other words, <\/span><b><i>assets \u2013 liabilities = owners\u2019 equity<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of results, in double-entry accounting both sides of the accounting equation are required to balance out at all times. For example, if your business assets total $200,000, the sum of your liabilities plus the owners\u2019 or stockholders\u2019 equity <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> equals $200,000. If it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doesn\u2019t <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balance, go back and check for an accounting or data entry error.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are four practical examples of how the accounting equation works in a double-entry system.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you borrow $25,000 from a bank, your assets increase by $25,000. However, because you have to pay the loan back, your liabilities also increase by $25,000.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finance invoices <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">worth $1,300, your assets increase by $1,300. So do your liabilities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you make a $5,000 sale, your assets increase by $5,000. Likewise, the owner\u2019s equity increases by $5,000 as well.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you purchase $8,000 worth of equipment, your liabilities increase by $8,000 while owner\u2019s equity<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decreases<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by $8,000.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is the Accounting Equation Used for?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main benefits of using the accounting equation is the fact that it provides an easy way to verify the accuracy of your bookkeeping. It also helps measure the profitability of your business. Are your liabilities significantly higher than your assets? This may indicate that you aren\u2019t managing your money very well. On the other hand, if the equation balances, it is a good indication that your finances are on the right track.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this information is useful to you as a business owner, of course. However, it is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> useful to potential investors and lenders because, in the event that you decide to seek financing, a balanced accounting equation helps demonstrate whether an investment in your business is a financially sound one (rather than<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-reasons-small-business-loan-rejected\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one they are compelled to reject<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your small business uses the double-entry accounting system for bookkeeping, a method that involves recording each financial transaction twice &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":7163,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232],"yst_prominent_words":[2057,2656,8076,8082,723,8077,2048,4763,2051,1157,2068],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"What is the Accounting Equation &amp; Why is it Important?
