This trend is good news for you if you run a construction business, since it\u2019s likely\u00a0to contribute in-market growth for contractors regardless of location.<\/p>\n<p>In most regions, the peak season of operation for construction is nine months.

Of the thousands of construction loans Lendio has helped provide, over 90% of them were Lines of Credit, Term Loans, or ACH Loans.<\/p>\n<p>In the construction business, you often don\u2019t get paid until you submit your invoices during the later stages of a job, but you need access to funds so you can bid on other jobs, pay your employees, buy and maintain equipment, and acquire materials to keep your business moving in the meantime.<\/p>\n<p>Because of this, lenders on Lendio\u2019s platform look at more than your credit history or how much cash you have in the bank. To evaluate the whole picture, lenders often take into account bank statements, the jobs you\u2019re currently working on, your invoices, and other information about you and your business.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are a new business working to bid on an early job or an established construction company trying to float some capital until a big payment comes through, there are several ways to supplement the working capital needs of your construction business.<\/p>\n<p>Once you figure out how much money you\u2019ll need, consider the following options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-line-of-credit-safety-net\/\">A business line of credit<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:<\/span>\u00a0The most flexible solution for all your business needs, a line of credit can help ease the burden of your cash flow, supplementing funds for payroll, restocking inventory, or funding advertising and marketing programs.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lp.lendio.com\/construction-loans?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=SMBInsights&amp;adgroup=PreparationInTheOffSeason&amp;keywords=2\">Business loan<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:<\/span>\u00a0Money in the bank makes anything possible and taking out a business loan provides you with access to cash when you need it. It also helps you plan ahead so there\u2019s less stress in planning to hire a top-notch crew or furnishing materials and labor for a last-minute build.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\">Invoice<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\">\u00a0financing<\/a><\/span>: Completing the work on, or ahead of schedule can prove to be challenging when there is a delay in payment of services.
