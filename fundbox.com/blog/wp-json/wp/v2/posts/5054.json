Is your landscape business ready for the season? How\u2019s your pipeline looking? Will last year\u2019s customers come back? What are you doing now to retain and win new business this year? Have you got sufficient capital to fund your seasonal push?<\/p>\n<p>Below are some tips for staying on top of marketing for your landscaping business.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Beat your landscaping competitors by focusing on your USP<\/h3>\n<p>In the landscaping industry, competition is rife. Few barriers to entry means that newcomers are popping up all the time\u2014and without a track record, they often bid low to win business.<\/p>\n<p>Underbidding is not a sustainable business practice by any means. Bidding low can be hit and miss and can quickly undermine profits, especially if the business owner is new to the industry and doesn\u2019t yet have a grasp of your true overheads.<\/p>\n<p>To beat the competition, you need to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">focus less on price and instead find your unique selling proposition<\/span> (USP). This could be your experience, customer service, use of innovative technology or green products, the convenience of your maintenance\/service contracts, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start marketing your business, spend some time thinking about what your brand means to you and your customers and how it differentiates you from the rest of the marketplace.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5059\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/shutterstock_423739813.jpg\" alt=\"landscape business\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/shutterstock_423739813.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/shutterstock_423739813-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Have a customer service strategy that does the selling for you<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Imagine if you didn\u2019t have to do any sales or marketing to promote your business! That\u2019s the power of referrals.<\/p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s neighbor to neighbor, via community forums like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nextdoor.com\/\">NextDoor<\/a><\/span>, or on social media, customer relationships are your most valuable asset. Unfortunately, they are often ignored or downplayed in favor of price wars.<\/p>\n<p>Consider how you can build your existing customer relationships with referrals and repeat business (more tips on this below) in mind before they take their business elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Target your marketing efforts<\/h3>\n<p>Look for ways to find the best opportunities for your business. Some jobs may be more profitable than others such as lawn care jobs that demand higher pricing such as organic treatments or landscape installations. What about upselling to existing clients? It could be as simple as reminding customers of the full range of services you offer or turning one-off jobs into maintenance jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps you may decide that it makes more sense to invest your marketing dollars in high-density routes such as a 20-mile neighborhood radius to maximize revenues and decrease the time and cost spent traveling between jobs.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Timing is everything<\/h3>\n<p>Just as important as targeting is timing. Plan ahead. Time your marketing so that you reach customers before they make their buying decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of waiting until the season arrives, market your business and stay on touch with customers year-round. Develop a plan to release flyers and email marketing that coincide with seasonal needs \u2013 lawn prep, mulching, and pruning in the spring; irrigation needs in late spring; maintenance throughout the summer; etc. Use social media to showcase successful jobs and happy clients.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Manage online reviews<\/h3>\n<p>Online reviews really do matter. In 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/learn\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\">97%<\/a> of consumers read online reviews for local businesses, with 12% looking for a local business online every day. Plus, 85% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. Make sure you\u2019re monitoring and managing online reviews of your business.<\/p>\n<p>Start by proactively requesting feedback every time you complete a job (frequency of reviews shows that your business is popular). The two most important outlets are likely to be your Facebook page (make sure you activate the review tab) and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\">Google Business Listing<\/a><\/span> (if you don\u2019t have one, create one, it\u2019s free). Always respond to reviews, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-handle-negative-online-reviews-of-your-small-business\/\">even if they\u2019re negative<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Become a trusted expert<\/h3>\n<p>One way to ensure your landscape business is visible and of service to your customers year-round is to offer regular information, tips, and useful content that helps position you as a trusted authority or thought leader on all things landscaping. Look for ways to offer useful online content so that your business will shine and generate quality leads early in the sales cycle. Consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Develop your content strategy <\/span>\u2013 Where should you focus time and effort for the best return? Take your time. It\u2019s ok to try and test a few tactics such as blogging, how-to videos taken with your smartphone, and so on.

Offer many ways to pay<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s critical that you get a return on your marketing investment ASAP, so it pays to get your invoice in front of customers immediately after the job is complete and offer them convenient ways to pay. In addition to check or credit card, consider an online payment service such as<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-pay\/\"> Apple Pay<\/a><\/span>,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/\"> Square<\/a><\/span>,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.paypal.com\/\"> PayPal<\/a><\/span>,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorize.net\/\"> Authorize.net<\/a><\/span>,<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/go.wepay.com\/\"> WePay<\/a><\/span>, and<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pay.google.com\/about\/\"> Google Pay<\/a><\/span>.

Past payment history, credit data, and your judge of character can help you gauge whether to extend credit.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, in extending credit you\u2019ve already paid for the materials and labor, so you may need to replace that cash elsewhere. Consider the benefits of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\">invoice financing<\/a><\/span> to support cash flow while waiting on payments.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Finance your seasonal push<\/h3>\n<p>Getting ready for the season can be costly. In addition to marketing, you need to hire workers, purchase supplies and equipment, and so on. Each of these investments can have a significant impact on cash flow, especially since the expenses are incurred before cash comes into your business.<\/p>\n<p>Enter working capital loans and a plethora of choices. Some small business financing options promise instant relief, others require a multitude of paperwork, personal guarantee, credit check, and more.<\/p>\n<p>A useful option for landscaping businesses is a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work\/\">business line of credit<\/a><\/span> since it gives you the flexibility to draw on cash when you need it, and repay back when you don\u2019t. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/direct-draw-newest-member-fundbox-family\/\">Fundbox Direct Draw<\/a><\/span>, for example, you can draw funds from your available credit anytime you want. There is no paperwork and no personal credit investigation to get started. If you don\u2019t need the money, don\u2019t use it. If you do need it, access your Fundbox business line of credit with just a few clicks.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Learn all about what&#8217;s involved to get funds for growing your business in our <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work\/\">2018 Small Business Guide to Lines of Credit<\/a><\/span>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>9. Get help when you need it<\/h3>\n<p>If you can\u2019t take this on yourself, consider working with a marketing consultant or freelance writer.
