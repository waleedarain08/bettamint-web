In fact, exhibiting at or attending gift markets and shows could be one of the most important things you do for your business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGift shows are a great way to learn about new trends and products in the marketplace, what\u2019s about to go viral and what\u2019s not,\u201d says Nicole Schaefer, founder of TheGiftingGoddess, a service in Portland Ore. that helps people find the perfect gifts for their loved ones, friends and clients. \u00a0\u201cShows are also a great way to connect and network with your peers and to learn with educational seminars \u2026 (and to) get an unfiltered look at what the competition is up to since information is almost always readily available and accessible (at the show).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The dilemma: figuring out which shows and gift markets to attend. With so many held throughout the year in practically every region of the country\u2014not to mention niche shows geared toward specific categories like gourmet, jewelry or collectibles\u2014the choices are endless. Even if you wanted to, you couldn\u2019t possibly attend them all.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re here to help with a fresh list of some of the best gift markets and shows around\u2014plus a cheat sheet you can grab to keep them all handy. Here&#8217;s where the pros go to see and be discovered.<\/p>\n<h2>Atlanta, Las Vegas are huge for gift pros<\/h2>\n<p>First up is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americasmart.com\/markets\/january-gift-home-rug\/\"><strong>The Atlanta International Gift and Home Furnishings Market<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0at AmericasMart Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to see everything in one place, this 53-year-old market might be the one for you. With more than 7 million square feet of total exhibit space, AmericasMart is often pointed to as the largest market in the world. And the gift and home furnishings market, held twice a year in July and January, is certainly one of its biggest draws.<\/p>\n<p>The Summer Market\u00a0(scheduled this year for July 9th\u00a0through 15th) alone has 8,000 brands exhibiting\u2014and that doesn\u2019t even include all of the permanent showrooms. Chelsea Peabody Bohannon, media relations manager for AmericasMart, says the show offers a mix of small and large brands, as well as international exhibitors and even some hyperlocal artisan vendors.<\/p>\n<p>Kirstin Martin, owner of Smitten Boutique in Chicago, says she makes it a priority to attend the Atlanta market every year. She loves the layout as well as the quality of the exhibitors she finds there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c(Last time) we went with a wish list, and we checked off most the items on our list,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>If you want an experience similar to Atlanta but can\u2019t make it all the way to the East Coast, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lasvegasmarket.com\/\"><strong>Las Vegas Summer Market<\/strong><\/a>, coming up July 28th through August 1st at World Market Center in Las Vegas, is a good alternative (the Winter 2020 market is January 26th through 30th). Even with 4,300+ exhibitors, the market remains walkable.<\/p>\n<p>The focus, says PR Manager Dallas Britt, is on \u201cexclusive products and programming\u201d not easily found at other events, such as fundraisers for charitable organizations, celebrity appearances, and design awards.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12195\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12195\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-600 wp-image-12195\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/IMG_2001.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees.

The show boasts 2,300 exhibitors and more than 25,000 attendees. Sugarfina exhibits at both annual shows (this year\u2019s summer show is August 10th-14th; dates for the Winter 2020 show are not yet available), and O\u2019Neill says it enables her to really target Sugarfina\u2019s ideal audience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as a confectionary brand,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe are a lifestyle and gifting brand so we want to go to shows with that position.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what NY Now offers. O\u2019Neill started exhibiting at the show in 2014 with the goal of creating brand awareness. She quickly met her goal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow we have a really great line-up of accounts that we work with,\u201d she says, adding that her company\u2019s relationship with the brand Total Wine\u00a0is a direct result of NY Now.<\/p>\n<p>As long as you\u2019re in New York, <a href=\"https:\/\/shoppeobject.com\/\"><strong>ShoppeObject<\/strong><\/a> is a very new but very up-and-coming show that is held at Pier 36 and happens to coincide with NY Now\u2019s dates. Stacy Maiano of Red Sail, an accessory, home and gift boutique in Portland, OR, says she has found hundreds of designers that she loves at ShoppeObject\u2014and the show has only been in existence since last summer. This summer\u2019s show will be its third. She says she loves that the show is much more curated than some of the others she has attended, and quality of the designers is impeccable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have an eye on advanced and progressive design-minded brands,\u201d says Minya Quirk, ShoppeObject\u2019s co-founder, adding that they are aiming to bring in sophisticated exhibitors who are catering to top-tier buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Quirk says she anticipates around 400 brands and 8,000 attendees at the summer show. While so-far small, Maiano considers this show a must-attend for discerning buyers such as herself.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many shows in this industry that these are just the beginning. In addition to the shows listed above it also hard to go wrong with the <a href=\"http:\/\/dallasmarketcenter.com\/markets\/\"><strong>Dallas Total Home and Gift Market<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-reef.com\/la-mart\"><strong>LA Mart at The Reef<\/strong><\/a>, Schaefer says.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stylemaxonline.com\/\"><strong>StyleMax<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0in Chicago is also highly recommended by many of the gift industry veterans we asked, along with <a href=\"https:\/\/seattlemart.com\/\"><strong>Seattle Mart<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/mplsmart.com\/\"><strong>Minneapolis Mart<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, the cost can be a factor when it comes to deciding which gift markets to attend. Schaefer recommends seeking out cost-saving opportunities like early registration, show-related hotel deals, incentives for first-time attendees and the possibility of getting day passes at reduced rates. \u00a0She also suggests looking into show sponsorship, since that frequently comes with incentives like free passes.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12194\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12194\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-12194 size-600\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/029-B71A4349_DxO.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees at ShoppeObject gift market in NY\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/029-B71A4349_DxO.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/029-B71A4349_DxO-768x455.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12194\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Attendees. Image courtesy of ShoppeObject in NY.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Have a gift market game plan to maximize your time<\/h2>\n<p>In terms of making the most of the shows you ultimately decide to attend, Martin says having a plan of attack is key. This means knowing what you are looking for along with what you are <em>not<\/em>\u00a0looking for (for example, don\u2019t spend a bunch of time looking at greeting cards if you know don\u2019t need them).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you do not have a focus or a game plan, you [will] become overwhelmed,\u201d she explains, adding that having a budget and comfortable shoes are also non-negotiable.<\/p>\n<p>For brands looking to exhibit at a gift market, a game plan is just as important, albeit somewhat different. O\u2019Neill recommends attending before exhibiting so you can get a feel for it. From there, she suggests starting out with just one show and making sure you can really focus on getting the most value out of it with your limited time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou are really going to learn a lot from your first show, so put your focus and effort into that,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Save this cheat sheet and keep top shows and dates handy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12190\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Fundbox-Must-Do-Gift-Show-cheat-sheet-2019.png\" alt=\"Fundbox Must Do Gift Market cheat sheet guide 2019\" width=\"600\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Fundbox-Must-Do-Gift-Show-cheat-sheet-2019.png 1200w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Fundbox-Must-Do-Gift-Show-cheat-sheet-2019-768x1126.png 768w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Fundbox-Must-Do-Gift-Show-cheat-sheet-2019-1047x1536.png 1047w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For gift brands and designers, exhibiting at gift markets and industry trade shows is one of the best ways to &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":102,"featured_media":12192,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72],"yst_prominent_words":[11262,11252,11251,5229,5357,11264,11255,11250,11261,11257,11253,11254,11259,11256,11260,949,11258,11263,4119,5246],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"top-right-risks","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"9 Gift Markets That Industry Pros Love | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"The dilemma: figuring out which gift markets and shows to attend.
