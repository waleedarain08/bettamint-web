Over time, as those relationships develop further, loyal customers emerge. Though they may only account for 15% of your base, these folks can be responsible for as much as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.crmtrends.com\/loyalty.html\">70% of your revenue<\/a><\/span>\u2014which should make developing loyal customers a top priority for all small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>One way to increase the chances you create loyal customers is by showing them your appreciation on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>When we think about customer appreciation, however, we often think about the world of retail. It\u2019s perhaps easiest for retail business owners to show customer appreciation because customers are always trickling in and out of their stores.<\/p>\n<p>How, then, are you supposed to show customer appreciation when you don\u2019t have the luxury of seeing your customers at regular intervals?<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you run a home services company (such as a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business\/\">painting business<\/a><\/span>\u00a0or a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/boost-landscaping-cash-flow\/\">landscaping company<\/a><\/span>). Just because it may be a little bit trickier to figure out how to show your customers you appreciate their business doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at seven customer appreciation ideas home service companies can leverage to increase loyalty and engagement\u2014boosting cash flow and strengthening the bottom line.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Host a Customer Appreciation Day each year<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>What better way is there to show your customers how much you appreciate their business than by renting out a restaurant or some other venue and hosting a Customer Appreciation Day event?<\/p>\n<p>It may set you back a few hundred dollars, but such an event\u2014held once a year\u2014will almost certainly be a good time.<\/p>\n<p>As an added bonus, your customers will be able to network with one another\u2014or at least meet some new folks that live where they do. If you tend to serve customers in a particular industry, or if you notice another common thread connecting your customers, that\u2019s a great reason to bring them together.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Offer cash rewards for word-of-mouth referrals <\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As a landscaper or the owner of a painting business, you\u2019ve almost certainly gotten some word-of-mouth referrals over the years. Locking down new customers without having to market to them\u2014what\u2019s not to like?<\/p>\n<p>Show your customers how much you appreciate them by launching an incentivized referral program. For example, you might offer existing customers $50 or $100 per successful referral. You could even offer that incentive in the form of credit for future services.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will your customers appreciate the gesture\u2014it\u2019s not like you get referral bonuses from the restaurant you recommend to your buddies\u2014the incentive may encourage them to talk about your business with new people, helping you unlock significant new revenue streams.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Get old school and use their mailbox<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In the age of emails, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2013\/04\/handwritten-notes-are-a-rare-c\">handwritten notes<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are increasingly rare. That\u2019s why we do receive something personal in the mail, it can make a big impression.<\/p>\n<p>While writing handwritten notes to all of your customers may certainly be a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/micahsolomon\/2015\/03\/05\/handwritten-notes-are-a-powerful-business-tool-until-they-become-a-buzzkill-heres-what-to-do-then\/#cfeeecc29155\">chore<\/a><\/span>, doing it once a year\u2014like during the holiday season\u2014will show them that you appreciate their business and aren\u2019t taking them for granted.<\/p>\n<p>You may have to give up a weekend day or several weekday nights to write the notes, but your customers will enjoy the gesture.<\/p>\n<p>If you have more money to spare than time, you can also try one of the many affordable, fast, online services that help you outsource handwriting those notes, too: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thankbot.com\/\">Thankbot<\/a><\/span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.handwrytten.com\/\">Handwrytten<\/a><\/span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MailLift<\/span>, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.feltapp.com\/\">Felt<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are a few options to try.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Give simple gifts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to show your customers you appreciate them is by giving them simple gifts.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that you\u2019d have to break the bank to give presents to all of your customers. Research, however, suggests that givers (i.e., you) are the ones that care about <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/insights\/research-confirms-its-thought-counts\">the price of gifts<\/a><\/span>. Receivers (i.e., your customers), on the other hand, are appreciative of all gifts, large and small, because of the thoughtfulness the gifts represent.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure what to give or where to start? There are services to help with that, too! For gifts that are fun and modern, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/try.greetabl.com\/corp-gifts\/\">Greetabl<\/a><\/span>\u00a0helps gift givers create and send small, personalized boxes that are delightful to open, while <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Token.ai<\/span>\u00a0recommends gifts anywhere up to $400 based on the occasion and recipient.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Teach your customers a skill relevant to your business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t like learning new things? When a physical gift doesn\u2019t seem right, think about giving something more long-lasting, like a new skill.<\/p>\n<p>Demonstrate customer appreciation by teaching your clients something they can really use. You can do that either by hosting a workshop or posting how-to videos on social media. Teaching relevant skills and documenting your knowledge is also a worthwhile marketing investment that helps build your online reputation as an expert in your field.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you own a painting company, you might demonstrate <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.diynetwork.com\/how-to\/skills-and-know-how\/painting\/how-to-create-decorative-paint-techniques\">the \u201cdragging\u201d technique<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to show customers one way they could paint an interior room. Similarly, a landscaper could create videos offering tips on how to choose grasses, plants, and flowers for their customers\u2019 yards.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to what some may think, teaching your customers how to do a few things won\u2019t make them less likely to hire you. Instead, it is far more likely to reinforce their trust in your expertise.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s an simple way to show that you understand your relationship with your customers doesn\u2019t end once money changes hands.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Launch a loyalty program<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Show your customers how much you value their business by giving them some services free of charge after they\u2019ve demonstrated their loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can offer to mow your customers\u2019 lawns for free after they\u2019ve paid for 10 cuts.<\/p>\n<p>It may be a bit tricky to figure out a loyalty program for your painting company, but it can still be done. Let\u2019s say a landlord who owns several properties contracts your business to touch up the exteriors of a number of buildings. Offer to paint an additional building (within reason) or at least give them a discount on the next job after you\u2019ve painted five or so properties for them.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Promote your customers\u2019 businesses on social media<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Your painting business or landscape company probably has its own social media presence. (If it doesn\u2019t, what are you waiting for?)<\/p>\n<p>Use social media to promote your customers\u2019 own businesses to demonstrate appreciation. It\u2019s an easy way to give back and boost your clients\u2019 companies for free. As small business owners know too well, it doesn\u2019t get much better than free publicity, and if you give them a shout out, they are more likely to return the favor.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Getting your business to the next level starts with ensuring your customers know how much you appreciate their business. That\u2019s the ticket to creating an army of loyal customers who help generate most of your revenue and won\u2019t hesitate to evangelize on behalf of your small business whenever the chance arises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smart small business owners know how important it is to do everything they can to engage and retain customers.
