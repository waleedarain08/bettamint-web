This annual event, run by the U.S. Small Business Administration, draws awareness to the nation&#8217;s 28 million small businesses. Yet, many small business owners tend to think of this week, held April 30-May 6, as a marketing plug.<\/p>\n<p>While the event does provide a great way to promote your small business, did you know that there&#8217;s more to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/nsbw\/nsbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Small Business Week<\/a> than marketing gimmicks and hashtags? In fact, there are loads of free workshops and events\u2014many of them specifically for women entrepreneurs. If you take advantage of these programs, you can get business advice that you would ordinarily have to pay big bucks for. Here&#8217;s how women entrepreneurs can tap into these programs and sign up for business boosting events close to home or online.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Participate in Local Small Business Week Events<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Along with an awards ceremony in Washington D.C. honoring several small business owners, National Small Business Week takes its show on the road May 1\u20135. SBA Administrator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/blogs\/writing-your-success-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Linda McMahon<\/a> is onsite for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/blogs\/get-ready-national-small-business-week?platform=hootsuite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">events<\/a> in Indianapolis, Arlington, TX and Fresno, CA. If you don&#8217;t live in any of these locations, don&#8217;t worry. You can watch the events <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/nsbw\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">live-streamed online<\/a>. In addition to the national roadshow, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/tools\/local-assistance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regional SBA chapters<\/a> are offering their own events. Also jumping into the act are National Small Business Week sponsors and local chambers of commerce with specialty programming. You can even find several city-wide programs in celebration of small business week. We did a little digging and came up with some worthwhile free events for women entrepreneurs. Take a look:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In Chicago, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freerangeoffice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Free Range office<\/a> is offering an all-day <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/small-business-week-womens-collective-tickets-33669721042?aff=erellivmlt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Women&#8217;s Collective Forum<\/a> on May 2, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/small-business-week-networking-reception-tickets-33670544505?ref=ebtn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an evening reception and panel discussion<\/a> on May 4.

The event also features speaker Melissa Ford of <a href=\"http:\/\/melissafordcoaching.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Melissa Ford Coaching<\/a> and a mindfulness workshop presented by<a href=\"http:\/\/erinracheldoppelt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Erin Rachel Doppelt<\/a>.
