A strong business plan contains the following sections:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Executive summary<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Company description<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market analysis<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Descriptions of offerings and value propositions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing and sales strategies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial info<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appendix (optional)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to making sure people actually know about your offerings and figuring out how to promote your business, you\u2019ll want to consider creating a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your small business.

Yes, most businesses will want to have a robust social media strategy in place. Social media is a great way to update your audience about new product launches, sales and promotions, and can be a fun and easy way to engage with your clients or customers on an ongoing basis. Marketers have found that social media marketing can lead to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/188447\/influence-of-global-social-media-marketing-usage-on-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increased exposure, improved traffic, better lead generation, and growing fan loyalty<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that being said, you should also find ways to connect with your audience outside of social media. Virtual networking events, live webinars, and in-person events (once social distancing restrictions lift), are all great ways to connect with your clients and customers who are interested in learning more about your products and services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in your customer service<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019re talking about getting social, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/363182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investing in your customer service offerings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great way to build loyalty and keep customers happy. Create an effective customer service strategy that is responsive (you don\u2019t want to keep them waiting for long), have solutions readily in place for common issues (like missing deliveries), and make sure that all of your customer service staff interact with your customers in a way that represents your company\u2019s culture and values.

Why are marketers so crazy about content marketing? This form of marketing does exactly what it sounds like, it relies on content. Generally, this term refers to web-based content such as blog posts, e-guides, and other content you can host on your businesses\u2019 website. Content serves multiple purposes that can help a business meet their goals, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Growing brand loyalty. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business, your main goal is to earn revenue. However you don\u2019t want to always be asking your customers to make purchases. To build brand loyalty, it can be helpful to give them something for free. Creating valuable and engaging content for your audience encourages them to come to you at times other than when they need to spend money.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Increasing SEO hits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The more content you have hosted on your website, the better chance that curious searchers will end up on your website after typing their query into a search engine.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Boosting your social and email presence. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want something besides advertisements and sales pitches to put in your email newsletters and social posts? Content gives you something fun or useful to promote that can help space out your pushes for purchases.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Building your authority. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want your customer base to respect you as an expert in your field? Providing top notch resources on your subject matter via content can help you build your reputation as an authoritative player in your industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversify your revenue streams<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know what they say about putting all of your eggs in one basket\u2014don\u2019t. When it comes to business, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/363182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">having multiple streams of revenue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (such as selling various products or offering more than one service) can help you increase interest in your brand and can accommodate the natural ebb and flow of revenue your products and services may generate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you own a company that only provides swimming lessons to children, you\u2019ll likely struggle to generate revenue during the winter. If you add first aid classes for parents into the mix, you\u2019ll be able to focus on that area of your business during the winter and can upsell the parents of your swimming students to take first aid classes all year round. If you already have a loyal customer base, try to come up with complimentary products and services you can offer that they\u2019ll likely be interested in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create strategic partnerships<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a small business on your own can be challenging, sometimes to take your business to the next level you might want to collaborate on a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/leveraging-strategic-partnerships\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic business partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can help lighten your load and bring more resources to the table.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strategic business partnership occurs when two businesses agree to team up and share their resources in order to mutually benefit. Small businesses often benefit from these partnerships because they can team up with other businesses in their industry in order to gain access to a new target market or to get their hands on valuable resources. By pairing up with another business, you can compete better with larger businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three types of strategic partnerships:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joint venture: This is when two companies combine their resources with the goal of meeting a certain objective. Both companies will be responsible for any costs and profits relating to this joint venture but they remain separate business entities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equity strategic alliance: To make an equity strategic alliance happen, one of the companies in the strategic partnership has to actually purchase equity in the other company. In some cases, both companies in the partnership will purchase equity in each other\u2019s companies.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-equity strategic alliance: Two or more companies sign a contract that states they agree to combine their resources in a non-equity strategic alliance. However, neither company will create a separate entity or share any equity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want more small business resources to help you keep your business growing?
