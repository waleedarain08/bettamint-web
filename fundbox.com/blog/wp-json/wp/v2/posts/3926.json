Hoping to become a trusted advisor to small businesses in areas other than tax planning and preparation?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are plenty of opportunities for accounting firms to expand their client base \u2013 especially among small businesses. A survey by<a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/accounting\/resources\/why-small-businesses-lack-accounting-resources-2018\"> <span class=\"s2\">Clutch<\/span><\/a> found that less than half (45 percent) of small businesses employ neither an accountant or bookkeeper. This oversight could damage their finances or waste valuable time that could be invested in other areas of their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet, some firms face an uphill struggle to earn the trust of the business community. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/list\/a-small-business-barometer-for-2019\"><span class=\"s2\">Accounting Today<\/span><\/a> reports that many small businesses that don\u2019t work with an accountant have a \u201clow affinity\u201d for the profession and were less likely to use their services in the coming year. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How can you overcome these preconceptions and take your accounting firm to the next level? Here are seven strategies and tactics for growth that can help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">1.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Understand what\u2019s made you successful\u2014and what\u2019s holding you back<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many CPAs say are so busy providing services or too bogged down in compliance stuff like auditing and filing that they don\u2019t have time to market and grow their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Accounting is a stable industry, so it can be tempting to sit on your laurels. However, if you want to grow your business and broaden the value you bring to your small business clients, staying the course isn\u2019t going to cut it, it\u2019s time to adopt a growth mindset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpa.com\/media-coverage\/year-ahead-accounting-experts-look-2018\">Accounting Today<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> asked a panel of experts what key initiatives will drive growth, and one insight from panelist Angie Grissom, president of<a href=\"https:\/\/therainmakercompanies.com\/\"> <span class=\"s2\">The Rainmaker Companies<\/span><\/a>, was insightful:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201c<\/span><span class=\"s4\">Take a look at your firm as if it is brand new. Determine what has made you successful (a culture of client service, or technical talent, for example.) Determine what is holding you back (disorganization around growth, lack of processes, training, technology, or talent, for example.) Make a decision to continue to focus on and strengthen the areas of strength and to work on and strengthen the areas of weakness. Put good people in charge of these initiatives. Seek experts. Stay the path. Set the tone. Go after it.<\/span><span class=\"s1\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">2.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Learn from your competitors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Who is your competition and how do you measure up? Where are the gaps in the market for your niche services? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/resource\/swot-analysis-worksheet\"><span class=\"s2\">SWOT analysis <\/span><\/a>will help you understand how you measure up to the competition, identify opportunities for your firm, and what it will take to get there. For tips, read: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/competition-can-help-your-business-grow\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Keeping Tabs on the Competition: 6 Ways It Can Help Your Business Grow<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can even use this exercise to learn directly from the competition. If another firm is doing what you want to do, find a way to network with them and learn from their experiences. Of course, you don\u2019t want to target your direct competitors, instead, look beyond your zip code or use your LinkedIn or association memberships to meet and greet other firms in your space. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">3. \u00a0Become invaluable<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The accounting world is based on the premise of selling time or services. If you\u2019re to succeed as a trusted small business advisor and change your paradigm, you\u2019ll need to focus on selling your true value-add for those businesses \u2013 your knowledge and experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The most important quality or feature that small businesses look for in an accountant, according to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/list\/a-small-business-barometer-for-2019\"> <span class=\"s2\">Accounting Today<\/span><\/a>, is that they are \u201ca trusted advisor to me\u201d (78 percent). Accountants, arguably, provide the best source of advice on what businesses should be doing to grow. But don\u2019t try to be all things to all people. Find your niche \u2013 whether it\u2019s one or two high-demand areas \u2013 and focus on marketing those.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">4.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Market your knowledge fiercely<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of developing a marketing plan to help you reposition your business and what you have to offer. The good news is, there are many free tools you can draw on to help you get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The AICPA, for example, offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aicpa.org\/career\/marketing.html\"><span class=\"s2\">free marketing toolkit<\/span><\/a> that can help you attract new clients and improve relations with existing ones, show you\u2019re a trusted advisor, and educate your prospects and the business community about CPA services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Look for opportunities to pitch your expertise to the media, whether through interviews, byline articles, or blogs. Hold customer seminars on topical small business themes at your office or a local low-cost venue. Blogging is also a great way to show your expertise and drive traffic to your website. Here are a few articles that can help you in these areas:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s5\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/does-your-business-marketing-need-a-makeover\/\"><span class=\"s6\">Does Your Business Need a Marketing Makeover?<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s7\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s5\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-ways-generate-great-pr-small-business-budget\/\"><span class=\"s6\">8 Ways to Generate PR on a Budget<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/diy-public-relations\/\"><span class=\"s8\">DIY Public Relations for Small Business Owners<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s7\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s9\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\"><span class=\"s6\">Lots of Tips About Blogging<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> (you\u2019ll find multiple articles in this link)<\/span><span class=\"s10\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/10-public-speaking-tips-for-small-business-owners\/\"><span class=\"s8\">10 Public Speaking Tips and Tricks for Small Business Owners<\/span><\/a><span class=\"s7\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">5.<\/span><span class=\"s3\"> \u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s1\">Make your client\u2019s challenges your priority<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As you start to step outside your \u201ccommoditized\u201d role and seek to expand your relationships with your clients, be sure to involve them. Instead of appearing at tax time, make your clients business your priority. Set up meetings or take them to lunch to discuss not just their accounting needs, but their growth plans and their pain points. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Again,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/list\/a-small-business-barometer-for-2019\"> <span class=\"s2\">research<\/span><\/a> from Accounting Today reveals that the perennial problems faced by small businesses in the last 12 months include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cash flow problems \u2013 32 percent<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Low profitability \u2013 31 percent<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Loss of a major client \u2013 22 percent<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Need for capital \u2013 21 percent<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Too much debt \u2013 11 percent<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cash flow and profitability represent a big opportunity for accounting firms to act as trusted advisors. Cash flow is also a big obstacle to success (37 percent).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other ways to add value include identifying gaps in your client\u2019s knowledge and offering free or discounted training sessions to help bring them up to speed.

If you\u2019re going to be more hands on with your clients, you\u2019ll need a helping hand. This may involve hiring junior accountants or outsourcing some of your business functions to a virtual assistant. As you plan for growth, you may also need to consider hiring staff into non-accounting roles such as business development, sales, and day-to-day business management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What about your own skill set?
