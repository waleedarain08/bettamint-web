In his long and varied career, he\u2019s mastered numerous aspects of the graphic design and manufacturing industry: production and installation, drawing, and customer service.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>In this interview, Asher unpacks the business and financial strategies he\u2019s employed to grow his own shop in a competitive industry.<\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Origins: Big Guy Signs<\/h2>\n<p>Asher Collins grew up surrounded by business-owning kin. As a boy, he watched his mother run her own restaurant. Two more aunts owned restaurants, not to mention the one who had a flower shop. His uncle owned a heating and air company, and his brother succeeded in the logging industry. Collins, however, never imagined he\u2019d follow in his family\u2019s footsteps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate owning my own business, it just happened,\u201d Collins admits. He had spent years working his way up the ranks at manufacturing and graphic design shops. Then when his employer closed its doors, Collins knew it was time to follow in his family\u2019s footsteps. \u201cWhether I sink or swim, I\u2019m in,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward 30 years, he\u2019s still swimming. Since 2010, he\u2019s led his graphic design and manufacturing business, Big Guy Signs. Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, <a href=\"http:\/\/bigguysigns.com\/\">Big Guy Signs<\/a> provides businesses with signs, printing, apparel, vehicle wraps, and more.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8429\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8429\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8429\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Asher-and-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Asher Collins, of Big Guy Signs\" width=\"400\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Asher-and-banner.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Asher-and-banner-768x485.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8429\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Asher Collins, owner of Big Guy Signs<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Challenges<\/h2>\n<p>Before starting his own business, Collins spent years working his way up the ranks of sign installation, production, and customer service at other companies around town. His experiences gave him a keen eye for industry trends.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI&#8217;ve been around a long time,\u201d notes Collins. \u201cI know that if you don&#8217;t stay current, you die.\u201d Collins pushed Big Guy Signs to get ahead of the digital printing curve, and brought processes in-house. This enabled him to guarantee project schedules and deliver a better product and service to customers.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, Collins couldn\u2019t control one thing: his customers\u2019 budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Indianapolis businesses clamored for vehicle wraps, custom graphics that turn a company\u2019s truck or van into a roaming billboard. Collins had the equipment, but few clients could afford the price tag. &#8220;A customer would come in wanting a vehicle wrap, but would settle for something smaller,\u201d he says, \u201cI was making $600 instead of $3600.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>The Bigger Picture<\/h2>\n<p>The problem wasn\u2019t just the missed revenue\u2013he was starting to fall behind the competition. \u201cOther shops around me were growing their vehicle wrap business,\u201d Collins remembers.<\/p>\n<p>Yelp lists nearly 90 sign makers in Indianapolis, ranging from corporate names like FedEx and Staples, to independent establishments like Big Guy Signs. If Collins couldn\u2019t satisfy the demand for vehicle wraps, someone else would.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Collins couldn\u2019t bankroll every business that came knocking for vehicle work. He had to balance his accounts receivable with cash on hand so he could keep his day-to-day business commitments: purchasing supplies, keeping the lights on, and paying salaries. Because of when his clients cut checks, though, weeks could pass before he got paid for work that he\u2019d already delivered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a gnawing frustration every day when I\u2019d think, \u2018Man, my rent&#8217;s due and I got three checks coming in, but they\u2019re due in two weeks,\u2019\u201d Collins sighs. \u201cThat frustration of daily business can really get you down.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8430\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8430\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Team.jpg\" alt=\"Big Guy Signs team members\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Team.jpg 800w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Team-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8430\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Big Guy Signs team members working on some vehicle signage.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>A New Way<\/h2>\n<p>Collins needed a sustainable way to stay competitive. He couldn\u2019t keep \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul,\u201d nor could he slash prices. Banks couldn\u2019t help him either. \u201cBusiness was strong, but because my credit wasn\u2019t the best, I couldn\u2019t get a loan,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n<p>Collins financed his invoices to help with his cash flow, but that didn\u2019t change his customers\u2019 problem: they wanted a vehicle wrap but had to settle for less. He needed a solution that not only helped his business, but that also financially empowered his clients.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Collins found Fundbox Pay.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #00bd9c;\"><em>\u201c<a style=\"color: #00bd9c;\" href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\">Fundbox Pay<\/a> has opened doors for my customers and secured the way I do business,\u201d says Collins. \u201cI love the fact that I get paid upfront and my customers are happier because they have options\u2013they can get what they want and not settle.\u201d<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Success with Fundbox Pay<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/\">Fundbox Pay is a credit network for business transactions.<\/a> With Fundbox Pay, Collins\u2019s customers can get approved for a line of credit and Net-60 terms, which gives them purchasing power. Additionally, when they pay Big Guy Signs with their line of credit, Fundbox advances funds so Collins gets paid right away.<\/p>\n<p>Collins and 11 of his customers have signed up to transact together on Fundbox Pay, generating nearly $60,000 in payments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFundbox Pay has opened doors for my customers and secured the way I do business,\u201d says Collins. \u201cI love the fact that I get paid upfront and my customers are happier because they have options\u2013they can get what they want and not settle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s exactly the win-win solution that Collins needed to unlock his vehicle wrap services. \u201cI&#8217;ve probably grown 60% because of Fundbox Pay,\u201d he estimates. \u201cVehicle wraps have become a major part of my business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To Collins\u2019s pleasure, his customers have learned to use Fundbox Pay on other products as well. \u201cOne of my customers started using Fundbox Pay to wrap a truck, but now they use it on shirts, prints, and more,\u201d he notes.<\/p>\n<p>As for the competition? Thanks to Fundbox Pay, Big Guy Signs started snagging business that his competitors once controlled, leaving Indianapolis sign makers puzzled as to what had changed so quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Fundbox Pay, and the ability to offer customers better payment terms, has become a core component of how Collins runs his business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore, I had no options. You make it work or you lose the business\u2013the stress could be brutal,\u201d he says. \u201cFundbox Pay has been a godsend.\u201d<\/p>\n<table cellpadding=\"25\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/get-paid\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8426 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/CTA0001-Get-Paid.png\" alt=\"Do you run a business like Big Guy Signs?
