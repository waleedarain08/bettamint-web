By pondering your business goals and planning the steps you will take to achieve them, you&#8217;ll be better able to assess your businesses&#8217; financial needs going forward. If you think you&#8217;ll need additional capital in 2017, you can consider solutions such as cash flow lending and investigate your business financing options ahead of time. It&#8217;s always smart to know your options before you really need the money!<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Potential Reasons to Consider Cash Flow Lending<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of factors to consider when calculating your need for financing in the coming year. Here are some of the most important:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Equipment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Will your business need to invest in new equipment, such as machinery or computers, in the coming year? The initial outlay to purchase equipment (or even start a lease) can leave you temporarily short of cash. In this case, cash flow lending can be an ideal solution.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Facility<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Do you plan to open a new location, expand to a bigger location, or move your business to a new address for whatever reason in 2017? The money required for moving\u2014building out a new space, payments due at lease signing, not to mention the expense of hiring movers\u2014can be hard to come up with all at once. Cash flow lending can help you get over the crunch so you&#8217;ll have a smooth move.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Marketing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Marketing and advertising are vital investments for any small business hoping to succeed in today&#8217;s highly competitive environment. If you&#8217;re planning to increase your marketing budget next year, as many small businesses are, cash flow financing can be a great way to get the money you need.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Human resources<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In order to grow, your business needs to hire employees\u2014and train them, and wait for them to get up to speed. It may take a while for the new hires to pay off in increased sales. In the meantime, you might struggle to make payroll. Fortunately, cash flow financing offers a simple way to tap into your unpaid invoices so you can rest assured that your employees will always get paid on time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>What Is Cash Flow Financing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Cash flow financing can be a perfect solution for all the financing needs above because it is so simple, quick, and easy. All you have to do is create a Fundbox account (it&#8217;s free to register) and link it to your accounting software. Once approved, you can choose which of your unpaid invoices to clear. That money will be deposited in your bank account in as soon as one business day. You have complete control over your finances\u2014you can clear all your invoices or even just a couple to meet your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Repaying your advance on <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow lending<\/a> is also simple. You just repay the invoice value plus a small fee over a period of either 12 or 24 weeks (you choose). Weekly payments are a lot easier to deal with than the onerous daily payments that some financing options require.\u00a0However, the smaller weekly payments make it simpler to manage your cash flow than big monthly payments.<\/p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t it nice to know that the answer to your financing problems is right at hand\u2014in your accounts receivables?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the end of the year draws nearer, it&#8217;s time to start thinking about your plans for your business in &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":7302,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[],"yst_prominent_words":[7825,723,3202,713,8211,2649,968,989,1904,3198,8212,2652,2654,3516,841,3311,865,759,2157,3453],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Is Cash Flow Lending in Your Business&#039; Future? | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"If you think you&#039;ll need additional capital in 2017, you can consider solutions such as cash flow lending and investigate your business financing options."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Is Cash Flow Lending in Your Business&#039; Future? | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"If you think you&#039;ll need additional capital in 2017, you can consider solutions such as cash flow lending and investigate your business financing options."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-lending-business-future\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/shutterstock_458316967.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/shutterstock_458316967.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"707"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"If you think you&#039;ll need additional capital in 2017, you can consider solutions such as cash flow lending and investigate your business financing options."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Is Cash Flow Lending in Your Business&#039; Future? | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/shutterstock_458316967.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-lending-business-future\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7210"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7210"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7210\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16233,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7210\/revisions\/16233"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7302"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7210"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7210"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7210"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=7210"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
