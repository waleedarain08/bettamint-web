As you know, cash flow is crucial to a small business\u2019s survival. Unfortunately, late payments have become far all too common, which puts many small businesses at risk. A<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/fundbox-study-reveals-crippling-effects-of-late-or-unpaid-invoices-300424576.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox survey<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revealed 64% of SMBs have dealt with\u00a0 a past-due invoice which caused the following repercussions in their companies:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">79% of small business owners couldn\u2019t pay themselves<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23% couldn\u2019t hire new employees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">23% were unable to invest in new equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20% stopped their marketing efforts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18% delayed pay increases or bonuses for employees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">17% weren\u2019t able to build their inventory<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the customer\u2019s end, an outstanding payment is no picnic either. Late payments can lead to lower credit scores and the embarrassment of being hunted down for money or being turned over to collections.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Life of an Invoice<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoices are born in several different ways: They can get created before the project starts, or the transfer of goods occurs, or come at the end of the sale once the agreement is completed. In any case, the invoice notice informs the recipient of the amount of payment that\u2019s due, when payment is due, and what forms of payment are accepted. It may also contain a purchase order number, a notice of early payment discount, and penalty fees for a past-due invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the invoice reaches the customer, it is usually either paid right away or entered into the customer\u2019s system and then scheduled for payment. However, sometimes the unexpected occurs. There may be unforeseen circumstances that can delay payment, or your customer could have simply forgotten to pay. In these cases, the recommended\u00a0 practice is to act immediately. You want to give customers the impression they need to make their payments on time. .<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do\u00a0 you request payment from past-due invoices? Take a look at\u00a0 these tips.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Writing the Past-Due Invoice Letter<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll likely want to act soon after the payment is late. The definition of late depends on your industry\u2019s accepted practices. You also should consider whether the customer repeatedly pays late or if this is a rare occurrence. Then you need to decide when to chase the unpaid invoice down and politely remind your customer about the unpaid invoice. That payment reminder usually starts with a past-due invoice letter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fastest method to send a past-due invoice letter is by email, and that\u2019s become an accepted practice by most customers today. Sending by email also allows you to attach a request receipt, so you\u2019ll know when your customer has opened your email. Be aware the person you sent the message\u00a0 to may have to approve the read receipt\u00a0 before you\u2019re notified. You can also send your past-due invoice letter via postal mail, but you\u2019ll be left wondering whether the letter was ever received. Whichever way you send the reminder, make sure you record the date it was sent and schedule how soon you want to follow up. Invoicing programs allow you to automate sending reminders, so you don\u2019t forget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, the letter must contain all the pertinent information about the past-due invoice and payment details, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copy of the original invoice<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice number, date of invoice, and the date you are sending the reminder<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details of the service provided or products purchased<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount owed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment terms, including late fees<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment options<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contact person\u2019s name, phone number, email, and hours the person can be reached<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about the tone of the past-due invoice letter as you\u2019re writing it. You may want to address a past-due invoice that\u2019s a few days to a week late in a polite and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">understanding tone. If the invoice is overdue, your language in the past-due invoice letter could\u00a0 be more robust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between overdue and past-due pertains to time. A past-due invoice denotes the deadline for payment has recently passed, while overdue means an invoice payment is considerably late. An overdue invoice letter needs to convey urgency and relate the consequences if the payment remains in default. Hopefully, it won\u2019t come to this. Still, if it does, think about turning the invoice over to a collection agency and let the customer know that\u2019s one of your considerations if payment isn\u2019t forthcoming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t feel comfortable creating this type of letter, search the internet for a past-due invoice email template to guide you through the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/hub\/invoicing\/writing-overdue-invoice-letters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreshBooks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suggests using polite phrases when corresponding with your customers. Their research shows b<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eing polite in your past-due invoice letters can actually<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help you get paid.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Invoices that included terms like \u201cplease pay your invoice within\u201d and \u201cthank you for your business\u201d were 5% more likely to be paid. And, they add, you should make sure to include the words \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d in your letter even when the invoice is months overdue. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also include links to payment options with the tagline: \u201cfor your convenience.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a month or more, it may be time to toughen your tone. Think about using phrases such as \u201cAction Required\u201d and \u201cUrgent Matter.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Phone Call<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your company has sent three or more past-due invoice letters, then it may be time\u00a0 to make a friendly phone call. Once you get someone on the phone, it becomes more difficult for them to avoid you\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would want to approach the phone call with a positive attitude and the assumption that the customer has either forgotten about payment or is too embarrassed to respond because they cannot pay you at this time. Your company will have a better chance of getting paid if you can come to an understanding, such as creating a payment schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be ready to accept payment over the telephone and have all the information you need on hand, so you don\u2019t have to scramble. If the person is not ready to make payment at this time, try to find out what the hold-up is. Consider setting up a follow up call in a few days and let them know of any late fees you may charge . Late fees are typically determined by using an interest calculator, which calculates the cost based on the number of days the payment is late.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Final Push<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you believe payment is not forthcoming, you need to decide whether you want to send the past-due invoice to a collection agency and report the customer to the credit bureaus. If it\u2019s gone this far, you\u2019re likely to lose the customer for good, but you may not want to continue to do business with them anyway.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, because late payments are common when running a small business, it\u2019s crucial to have a backup plan, so your cash flow isn\u2019t seriously disrupted. Securing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ensures you\u2019ll have cash on hand in case of serious shortfalls. A line of credit gives you access to the capital you need and the confidence to handle late payment challenges without breaking a sweat.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A past-due invoice can cause all sorts of problems for a small business.
