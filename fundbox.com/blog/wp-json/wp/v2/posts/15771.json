In the U.S., minorities make up 32 percent of the population,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbc.senate.gov\/public\/index.cfm\/minorityentrepreneurs#:~:text=Over%20the%20last%2010%20years,totaling%20close%20to%20%24700%20billion.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but only 18 percent of business owners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minority business owners face their own set of unique obstacles when running their businesses. From access to education to equity, communication, and cultural factors, there are several systemic barriers that can create challenges for minority business owners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.mbda.gov\/page\/executive-summary-disparities-capital-access-between-minority-and-non-minority-businesses.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> developed by the Department of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency found that sufficient access to capital remains a key factor in limiting the establishment, expansion, and growth of minority-owned businesses. Findings from the same report showed that minority-owned businesses are less likely to receive funding and, if approved, receive smaller loans and higher interest rates than their non-minority counterparts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minority business owners are often faced with more institutional barriers to funding, such as limited banking options, insufficient credit history, and implicit bias. In addition, minority business owners are less likely to apply for funding due to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rockefellerfoundation.org\/blog\/breaking-barriers-to-credit-and-capital-access-for-black-latinx-and-women-owned-businesses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fear of rejection<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This can mean they miss out on equal funding opportunities or resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding what financing options are available can help business owners during difficult times and times of growth. There are different programs and loans designed specifically for minority-owned businesses. These options can provide a vital source of funding to help traditionally underserved communities launch or grow an existing business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding Funding for Minority-Owned Businesses<\/span><\/h2>\n<h4><b>Loans vs. grants<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loans refer to money borrowed with the expectation of paying it back (most often with interest) over a set and agreed-upon period of time. Loans are broadly available and offer flexibility in terms of eligibility requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grants offer funding with no expectation of repayment; however, they are less common than loans. Because they are few and far between, business owners can expect most grant programs to be highly competitive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>What are loans for minority-owned businesses?\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are loans that are specifically designated for businesses owned and operated by minorities, designed to increase funding access to traditionally underserved communities. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to minority-owned business loans. There are many options, and loans are available from a variety of different providers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of these loans is to level the playing field for minority-owned businesses and improve their chances of accessing the necessary capital to start, operate, or grow their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>What you need to qualify for a minority-owned business loan<\/b><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business must be minority-owned. That usually means a business must be at least 51 percent owned or operated by a person belonging to Black, Hispanic, Native-American, Asian, or other racial or ethnic group(s).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some federal loans and programs for minorities require your business to first apply for and obtain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nmsdc.org\/mbes\/mbe-certification\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minority business enterprise certification<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonprofits and other entities that are not connected with the government also create and extend loans. Loan qualification requirements vary depending on the loan and the lender.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of these programs and loans require lengthy applications and paperwork, plus a high FICO (credit) score or collateral. In some cases, you\u2019re only eligible for financing with a business history of at least two years.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten Minority-Owned Business Loans to Consider<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you Google \u2018minority-owned business loans,\u2019 you\u2019ll find pages and pages of results. Seeking out the right loan for your business can be overwhelming. There are a variety of options available, but as with other types of financing, eligibility and terms vary. Some are more favorable than others. Here are some of the best minority loan options to consider<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Small Business Administration is a federal entity created to foster small business growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>SBA Community Advantage Loans<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/partners\/lenders\/7a-loan-program\/pilot-loan-programs#section-header-0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA Community Advantage (CA)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> loans help small businesses in underserved markets. Under this pilot program, minority-owned businesses can receive up to $250,000 with a maximum interest rate of prime plus six percent. The SBA guarantees 85 percent for loans up to $150,000, and 75 percent for loans larger than $150,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA CA loan terms vary depending on how you use the funds: Loan terms for equipment and working capital may extend up to 10 years, while those for real estate may extend up to 25 years. These loans are a decent option for new businesses, as well as those with below-average credit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To apply for a CA loan you\u2019ll need to contact an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/document\/support-carl-lenders-state\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved lender in your area.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Approved lenders include community development corporations, SBA-authorized microloan providers, and community development financial institutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>SBA Microloans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/loans-grants\/see-what-sba-offers\/sba-loan-programs\/microloan-program%20\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA microloans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are open to all businesses, but are a good option for new minority small business owners or those seeking loans of $50,000 or less. The SBA microloan program offers up to $50,000 with seven-year maximum terms and interest rates typically ranging from 6 percent to 9 percent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These microloans are made available through third-party lenders. To apply, you must work with an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/articles\/microlenderrpt5_20170621.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA-approved intermediary<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your area.

The program is not designed specifically for minorities; however, a third of the 7(a) loans go to minority-owned businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest rates on SBA 7(a) loans are some of the lowest you\u2019ll find, allowing minority business owners to invest more profits in growth rather than paying off debt. You can qualify for up to $5 million with a repayment term of between 10 and 25 years. To apply for a 7(a) loan, you need to complete an application with an SBA lending partner, like a bank or credit union. The lender will submit your application to the SBA to receive a loan guarantee; this way, if you are unable to pay the loan, the SBA will repay the guaranteed amount to the lender.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>SBA 8(a) Business Development Program<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not technically a loan, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/federal-contracting\/contracting-assistance-programs\/8a-business-development-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA 8(a) Business Development Program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> helps minority-owned businesses gain access to federal contracts.
