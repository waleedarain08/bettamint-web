Not necessarily. Here are five warning signs that your company might be headed for cash flow problems.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your business is growing too fast.<\/strong> Rapid growth might sound like a nice \u201cproblem\u201d to have. In reality, though, growing faster than you expected or planned for can lead to serious cash flow problems for a small business. Growth typically means you will need to hire more employees, expand to a bigger location or manufacture more products to support your new customers. All of these changes require more money, but if the income from business growth isn\u2019t enough to support the new expenses, you can quickly find yourself in a cash crunch.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your receivables are out of whack.<\/strong> Are your customers paying slower than they used to, paying late, making partial payments or not paying at all? Any of these changes can put you into a cash crunch\u2014especially if it\u2019s an indicator of industry-wide financial troubles among your clients. Monitor your receivables closely on a regular basis. Set up systems to remind you when receivables are due; then reach out to customers to follow up as soon as the payment isn\u2019t received. This not only helps you get paid faster but also keeps you abreast of bigger problems, such as a key customer who starts having financial problems.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You aren\u2019t managing your payables wisely.<\/strong> While you should try to accelerate payments from your customers, paying your own payables early is a big mistake. Instead, try to delay your payments to vendors as long as possible so you can keep the cash in your bank account and working for you. Use automatic payment tools such as direct debiting to ensure you don\u2019t miss a payment deadline (and hurt your business credit score), but set them up to pay on the deadline or the day before, not two weeks ahead of time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t have adequate working capital to provide a cushion in case of emergency.<\/strong> Perhaps your cash flow is doing fine now, but what would happen if a big customer suddenly left you or stopped paying on time? Getting a business line of credit is a smart move to provide backup in case of the unexpected. (Be sure to apply for the line of credit <em>before<\/em> you need it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You don\u2019t monitor your business\u2019s cash flow.<\/strong> There\u2019s no excuse today for not staying on top of your cash flow. If you use accounting software, it\u2019s easy to generate financial reports and view your financial statements at a glance so you can spot problems and get out in front of them. Some business owners review their cash flow every day; others do so once a week. The right timing for you will depend on your financial plans, but whatever you do, don\u2019t be an ostrich with your head in the sand and never monitor cash flow at all.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customers are clamoring for your product or service and your business\u2019 sales are up, but does that mean all\u2019s well &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":3171,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11532],"yst_prominent_words":[1165,723,3202,713,705,739,798,5327,978,3198,714,3528,1529,5328,5329,851,1699,865,1387,3927],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"5 Warning Signs You Could Be Headed for a Cash Crunch","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Here are five warning signs that your company might be headed for cash flow problems."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"5 Warning Signs You Could Be Headed for a Cash Crunch"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Here are five warning signs that your company might be headed for cash flow problems."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-warning-signs-you-could-be-headed-for-a-cash-crunch\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shutterstock_293651120.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shutterstock_293651120.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Here are five warning signs that your company might be headed for cash flow problems."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"5 Warning Signs You Could Be Headed for a Cash Crunch"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shutterstock_293651120.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-warning-signs-you-could-be-headed-for-a-cash-crunch\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2154"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2154"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2154\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2472,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2154\/revisions\/2472"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3171"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2154"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2154"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2154"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=2154"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
