There are two ways to prepare your cash flow statement: the direct method of cash flow and the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">indirect method of cash flow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct vs. indirect method of cash flow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both methods of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/abcs-overcoming-cash-flow-gaps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> yield the same total cash flow amount, but the way the information is presented is different. The difference, however, only applies to the operating cash flow. The investing and financing sections present the same way whether you use the statement of cash flows direct method or indirect method.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the <\/span><b>direct method of cash flow<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you count only the money that actually leaves or enters your business during the designated reporting period. To do that, you start with a blank slate, then add and subtract all your company\u2019s operational cash transactions. These transactions could include receipts from product or service sales, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/simplify-small-business-payroll\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payroll<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, rent, supplier payments, or materials expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><b>indirect method of cash flow<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-accounting-method-business-cash-accrual\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accrual accounting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is when you record revenue and expenses at the time a transaction occurs, rather than when you actually lose or receive the money. Using your income statement, you start with your company\u2019s net income as a base. From there, you refer to the changes on your balance sheet to add and subtract from your net income. Keep in mind that the indirect method accounts for non-cash factors like depreciation, while the direct method doesn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why use the indirect method of cash flow?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the Financial Accounting Standards Board generally prefers the direct method <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement of cash flow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, both the direct and indirect methods of cash flow are in line with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the direct method can be tedious and time-consuming, which is why business owners tend to prefer the indirect method. Plus, since most businesses already use accrual accounting to record their financial information, using the indirect method to calculate cash flow from operations keeps things consistent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to calculate operating cash flow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business\u2019s operating cash flow is the first section of a cash flow statement. Operating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-for-freelancers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows how much net cash your business generates from everyday business operations, which is why it\u2019s a good indicator of how profitable your company is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-planning-for-a-food-truck-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive operating cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means you\u2019re bringing in more money from your core operations than you&#8217;re spending. Negative operating cash flow, on the other hand, could be a sign that you need to readjust your pricing model, reduce your expenses, or apply for funding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The formula for calculating operating cash flow is:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Operating cash flow = net income + depreciation &#8211; change in assets and liabilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, we\u2019ll explain how to put this formula into action step by step.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to create a cash flow statement using the indirect method<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use an Excel spreadsheet to prepare your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow statement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or check out the resources and templates your accounting software offers. Whichever route you choose, make sure you have your most recent income statement and balance sheet on hand to draw from.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Record your net income and adjust for non-cash expenses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by recording your net income for the reporting period in question. Calculating net income requires subtracting your business\u2019s expenses, operating costs, and taxes from your total revenue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, adjust your net income to account for non-cash expenses, like depreciation of your assets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Adjust for assets\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/understanding-balance-sheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balance sheet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, adjust your net income for increases and decreases to your assets. Your assets include things like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/difference-between-factoring-and-receivables-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounts receivable<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, inventory, property, stock, and cash. In general, increases to your assets (except for cash) decrease your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complete cash flow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while decreases to your assets increase your cash flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an example, if you buy a commercial property, you accumulate another asset, but the amount of cash you have decreases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Adjust for liabilities\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you account for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/assets-liabilities-equity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">assets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, adjust your net income for changes in your liabilities, like accounts payable, expenses, and debt. Keep in mind that decreases to your liabilities\u2014say, for example, making a loan payment\u2014can decrease your cash flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, increases to your liabilities in the form of credit\u2014like adding a vendor payment to accounts payable\u2014may either increase your cash flow or keep it steady.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4: Include cash flow from investing and financing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To finish off your cash flow statement, you\u2019ll need to include <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">direct cash flow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from your investing and financing activities. Investing activities could include buying or selling property or equipment, or issuing or buying back common stock.
