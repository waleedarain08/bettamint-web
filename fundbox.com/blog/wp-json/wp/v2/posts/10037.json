Leaving behind a comfortable 9 to 5 to turn a dream into a full-time job takes a measure of doing. When you consider the long hours, the stress, the people management, and the never-ending list of responsibilities, there\u2019s only one thing that keeps small business owners going when times start to get tough: passion.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens when that passion starts to wane and your motivation begins to suffer?<\/p>\n<p>You may think it won\u2019t happen to you, but there are many reasons why passion fades as a business grows.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are also ways to avoid it. Here are a few things to look out for as you seek to stay motivated through the challenges of running a small business, as well as tips on how <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/lp.lendio.com\/simple-small-business-loans\/?medium=PR&amp;source=Earned&amp;campaign=Fundbox&amp;adgroup=Part3Passionate&amp;keywords=2\">smart financing<\/a><\/span>\u00a0can help you maintain the passion you need to succeed:<\/p>\n<h2>Burnout<\/h2>\n<p>Success doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and small business owners know that. But reaching for success day in and day out can often lead to burnout. It might not be obvious when burnout rears its ugly head; some common signs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exhaustion<\/li>\n<li>Anxiety and panic attacks<\/li>\n<li>Feeling overwhelmed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It\u2019s not uncommon for hardworking small business owners to feel a burnout approaching. A 2016 <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">study<\/span>\u00a0from Business Networking International found that one in four entrepreneurs say they feel moderately burned out. When burnout starts to happen, there are a few ways small business owners can pump some gas back into the tank:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delegate to lessen the workload<\/li>\n<li>Exercise<\/li>\n<li>Take a vacation<\/li>\n<li>Disconnect from digital life, including work e-mail, for a few days<\/li>\n<li>Designate at least one day off every week and stick to it<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Burnout isn\u2019t something to take lightly\u2014understand the signs of burnout and have a few tools for managing it so you can come back refreshed and energized.<\/p>\n<h2>Fear of competition<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty normal as a small business owner to fear a competitor might put you out of business. But that fear can be crippling. By fearing your competitors and putting your focus on them, you are giving them a great deal of power. Instead, focus your time and energy on making your customers happy and improving your own business.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a bad idea to keep up with what your competition is doing, but it\u2019s more important to reflect on your own business. Take some time to ask yourself these questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is your business good at?<\/li>\n<li>What is your business bad at?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your long-term plan?<\/li>\n<li>Who is your competition?<\/li>\n<li>How are you going to make adjustments to improve?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Instead of fearing the competition or being complacent about it, think of all the ways you can be better and subsequently, outperform the competition.<\/p>\n<h2>Feeling uninspired<\/h2>\n<p>Getting stuck is part of life. We all hit roadblocks, fall into exhaustion, and have difficult challenges to navigate. In business, learning how to get unstuck is critical. If you\u2019re feeling stuck, try taking a break, free from guilt. You\u2019ll come back more relaxed and productive.<\/p>\n<p>Another effective way of getting out of an uninspired rut is to talk to someone. It\u2019s much easier to approach a problem with support from people in your network. Talk to an employee, a business partner or even a business coach to get the ideas flowing again and restore your excitement and motivation.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10040\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/shutterstock_523778200.jpg\" alt=\"Running a business, it's easy to get burned out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/shutterstock_523778200.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/shutterstock_523778200-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Money troubles<\/h2>\n<p>Every business has to handle peaks and valleys in revenue, and these large swings can make it difficult to manage your cash flow.
