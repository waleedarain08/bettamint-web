This is especially true for small businesses and their employees, as well as independent contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On March 27, the government passed the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\u2014the CARES Act<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and on December 27, 2020, the Covid Relief Bill was added to renew financial assistance programs. These stimulus packages were designed to give financial relief to individuals and businesses that have been negatively affected by the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These acts include two loan options for businesses: the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP), and the SBA\u2019s Economic Injury Disaster Loan, or EIDL. <\/span><b>This article focuses on just the PPP loan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a PPP loan? What makes it different? Why should I be trying to take out yet another loan at a time like this?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The PPP loan is a new program from the Small Business Administration <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as of 2020<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I think it may be a disservice to call this program a loan. It&#8217;s more like a loan that converts to a grant, and it&#8217;s for small businesses\u2014typically those with fewer than 500 employees\u2014to help them maintain their employees and their payroll over <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is hopefully the most significant business disruption.

It only guarantees loans provided through SBA-preferred financial institutions, such as banks, microlenders, and even some fintech companies. In order to get a PPP loan, <\/span><b>you have to apply through a financial institution<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which then submits the application to the SBA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So your first step could be to ask the financial institution you do your business banking with if they are an approved PPP lender, and if they are accepting PPP applications. If your business bank is not an approved SBA lender, you need to find a lender now. You can find a state-by-state list of approved lenders on the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/sba.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>SBA.gov<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you learn that your business&#8217;s bank or credit union is not an approved lender\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/coronavirus-relief-options\/paycheck-protection-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The SBA can help you find a lender<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the lender approves your application, it gets sent to the SBA for approval and then it\u2019s time to cross your fingers and hope you get approved before May 31, 2021 or before the next round of funding is exhausted, whichever comes first. If you are lucky enough to get your application approved before the funds run out, <\/span><b>you will get notification (usually by email) to sign final agreements, you&#8217;re then issued an SBA loan number, and then payment is electronically deposited into your business bank account within 10 days.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can I do to maximize my chance of getting approved for the loan?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, it&#8217;s important to act fast, since these loans are considered on a first-come-first-served basis.

This choice depends on how long you wish to pay your employees while being held to the criteria for forgiveness, as explained below).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These forgiveness rules are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>60% of the money for payroll costs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within a period of 8 weeks or 24 weeks\u2014beginning on the day the PPP funds were deposited in your business bank account.
