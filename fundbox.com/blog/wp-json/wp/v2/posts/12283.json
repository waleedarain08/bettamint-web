The results were astounding.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are few areas of the economy in which millions of dollars in goods and services could be received solely with an IOU. Yet, such a system prevails for the millions of U.S. businesses that engage in trade credit relationships with their business partners. One eye-popping figure demonstrates just how prevalent the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d B2B payment practice has become: $3.1 trillion is the net amount U.S. firms are owed in accounts receivable on any given day,\u201d according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/smbs\/2019\/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms\/\">PYMNTS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/smbs\/2019\/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms\/\">Download the free report from PYMNTS.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Launch: OroCommerce teams with Fundbox<\/h2>\n<p>OroCommerce, the B2B e-commerce software provider, selected Fundbox to offer the Oro\u2019s marketplace customers a powerful new checkout solution that unites fast credit decisions with on-demand access to trade financing. Owned by Oro, Inc, a company that was founded in 2012 by industry leaders in open-source business application development, OroCommerce is dedicated to revolutionizing B2B commerce through digital transformation.<\/p>\n<p>PYMNTS reported on the partnership: &#8220;Trade credit has been around for decades and is less than efficient, with $3.1 trillion tied up in outstanding invoices. To grease the wheels of commerce, Fundbox and OroCommerce are joining forces to provide B2B credit through the two-sided platform model. Jason Smith, vice president of business development and partnerships at Fundbox, tells PYMNTS that a data-driven, machine learning-enabled model makes all the difference between access to capital \u2014 and turns gridlock into growth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2019\/06\/25\/1873962\/0\/en\/Fundbox-Tapped-By-Top-B2B-E-Commerce-Software-Provider-OroCommerce-to-Power-Net-Terms.html\">press release<\/a> for details about the partnership.<\/li>\n<li>Read the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/b2b-payments\/2019\/fundbox-and-orocommerce-team-to-break-the-3-1t-trade-credit-logjam\/\">article in PYMNTS<\/a> for insights from Jason Smith, Fundbox Vice President of Business Development and Partnerships.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Launch: AND CO + Fundbox integration for freelancers<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve launched our integration partnership with AND CO, enabling approved freelancers to get faster access to credit than ever before, all from within their AND CO workflows.<\/p>\n<p>AND CO wrote on their blog: \u201c71% of freelancers have trouble getting paid at some point in their career.
