Walsh has a long history in traditional banking, having worked at Lloyds Banking Group, Wells Fargo and American Express. That experience is in part what led him to his hopes of molding the future of banking, and co-founding Varo, a new type of bank.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Varo\u2019s mission? \u201cAll-in-one mobile banking.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9290\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9290\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9290 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colin-Walsh-headshot-small.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Walsh, CEO of Varo\" width=\"300\" height=\"265\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colin-Walsh-headshot-small.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colin-Walsh-headshot-small-768x678.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Colin Walsh, CEO of Varo<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Varo\u2019s stated goal is \u201cto improve customers\u2019 financial health.\u201d The firm integrates banking products and services we all know well (deposits, savings, and lending) with financial health tools, like cash flow projections, spend tracking, and smart alerts. The company website explains, \u201cThis combination of integrated financial solutions and proprietary technology makes us the first entrant to truly challenge the existing banking model.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Varo aims to be like the Disney of the banking world; they say they\u2019re \u201creimagining what banking can be.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Building the Future of Banking<\/h2>\n<p>As part of our interview series on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The State of Small Business Lending<\/span>, we talked to Walsh about the future of banking and how Varo is embodies 21st\u00a0century banking.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fundbox: <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Will mobile banking replace traditional banking? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: I don\u2019t think it will replace traditional banking. There will always be a segment [of the population] who want to go into a branch or sit on hold on the phone. But, mobile banking is growing quickly. Just look at the statistics: In 2011, 13% of people used mobile banking. In 2016, it was 56%.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">There\u2019s a new generation of consumers who\u2019ve grown up on and with their phones. They were basically born with phones in their hands, and their usage is much more commonplace.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0What will the 21st Century banking experience be like?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: It will be intuitive and personalized. You\u2019ll be able to solve everyday problems with a few taps on your phone. Today, all your financial data is trapped in silos. Banks don\u2019t recognize you\u2019ve been their customer for 20 years.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">But, consumers need a bank that understands them. For instance, if a consumer wants to make a big purchase, [a bank should] inform them they have a mortgage payment coming up. And maybe they would rethink the purchase.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Banks should help solve problems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">They should anticipate what will happen, so consumers don\u2019t have to worry about it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">When we started we were surprised to learn that people are so hands off with their money and finances. They don\u2019t do budgets and spreadsheets. Most millennials (75%) are particularly hands off\u2014they manage their finances by checking their bank balance on their phones two times a week.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Banks profit from human failure. Last year they made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/banking\/2018\/banking-overdraft-fees-cfbp-credit-unions\/\">$34.3 billion<\/a> on overdrafts. At Varo, we want to help people get ahead. To avoid bad things and lead a financially healthy life.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Speaking of millennials, what do they expect from services like Varo\u2019s? How does this expectation influence your product roadmap?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: Free banking is a given\u2014a big one. They don\u2019t expect to pay for things that should be free. Millennials want to know, \u201cWhy am I paying fees to give you my money?\u201d And they want good products that don\u2019t cost a lot.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Millennials want frictionless banking experiences. They benchmark banks against companies like Facebook, Instagram, Amazon and Google, which have spent billions taking the friction out of consumer experiences.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">They expect things to work intuitively. They think banks should supply solutions so consumers don\u2019t have to wait in line, fax forms or wait on the phone. Millennials won\u2019t put up with that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">They\u2019re also looking for the \u201cdelight\u201d factor. They want to get an alert that\u2019s useful, or be able to set up a savings account in 30 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Have the big banks turned Millennials and Gen Z off?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: They\u2019re pretty unloved. There\u2019s been a fundamental misalignment of experiences. Like I said, banks profit on human failure. Consumers get charged for unexpected expenses, late fees, overdrafts and more. This all piles up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I saw this when I was working for big financial institutions. There are antiquated processes in big banks. They do things the way they\u2019ve always been done. And millennials have a low bar for what they\u2019ll put up with.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;\">Don\u2019t get me wrong. There are well-intentioned people who work in banks. But some are not helpful, and younger people say they\u2019d rather deal with a bot than an unhelpful, unfriendly person in real life.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What are traditional banks missing when it comes to customer experience?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: There are several issues: fundamental, organizational and technological.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The fundamental issues. As I said, the data is trapped in silos. There\u2019s Mortgages; Checking accounts; Credit card group. They don\u2019t talk to each other. There\u2019s no holistic view. Marketing might know, but that does not translate to daily experiences [of consumers].<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The organizational issues. There are fiefdoms and leaders with big egos all vying for their individual goals, not thinking about holistic customer relationships. Their internal politics are misaligned. The branch people are protecting their turf from the mobile and online people and so on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The technological issues. The technology is antiquated\u2014it\u2019s 30-40 years old. The programmers who created it are retired or dead. And it\u2019s hard to attract new talent\u2014who wants to program in Fortran?<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The big banks have acquired so many smaller banks and tried to knit their systems together\u2014but it\u2019s like spaghetti. It takes a long time to untangle and put something new in front of consumers. Banks can\u2019t get out of their own way.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">At Varo, every 90 days our app looks different. We ask, \u201cWhat do customers want?\u201d And we build it.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How do you counter the notion that\u2019s been pushed for years that entrepreneurs should \u00a0make \u201cfriends\u201d with their bankers?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: Back in the day, entrepreneurs were held hostage to their banks. But [at Varo], we view it through the lens of \u201cDon\u2019t tolerate stuff that\u2019s not right for you.\u201d It\u2019s disrespectful to expect [consumers to do] that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Consumers\u2019 new expectation is, \u201cGive me what I want. I\u2019m giving you my money.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Varo is a credible alternative to a big bank. We offer better rates on savings, easy access to lending, and tools to track spending. Small businesses don\u2019t have [these things]. But, the next generation will bring alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What did you observe while building Varo that surprised you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: We were surprised that consumers were so hands off. We thought, let\u2019s let them engage\u2014but most consumers don\u2019t want to. They think, \u201cGive me the information I need when I need it. I don\u2019t want to spend time on banking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It\u2019s important to get the tone of voice right. Consumers don\u2019t want to be nagged and told they\u2019re doing it wrong. They <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do<\/span>\u00a0want coaching and support that\u2019s friendly, accessible and approachable.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">How we speak to consumers is important. We\u2019ve been obsessed with our customers. We\u2019ve set up listening posts. We look at <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all<\/span>\u00a0the app reviews. If we only get one or 3 stars, we figure out what went wrong.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It\u2019s amazing how often our \u201csuggest a feature\u201d is used. We get thousands of comments. People wanted mobile check deposits and customer service \u00a0at night and on weekends. And we\u2019ve given it to them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Our Net Promoter Score\u00a0has shot up. Customer acquisition has shot up. We\u2019re listening. And people are not used to being listened to. They tell us, \u201cYou actually listened to us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What\u2019s next for Varo?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span>: We\u2019re still listening and innovating. We have lots of product enhancements on our roadmap, and we\u2019re staying ahead of what customers want. An Android app is coming soon, which will double the population we can reach.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Varo was the first fintech to apply for a national bank charter. We\u2019re the first bank for those who want mobile banking. We are building the future of banking.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>Hear from more financial industry thought leaders:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/jared-hecht-mission-change-face-small-business-lending\/\">Fundera&#8217;s Jared Hecht is on a Mission to Change the Face of Small Business Lending<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/state-small-business-lending-fundbox-qa-lendio-ceo-brock-blake\/\">The State of Small Business Lending: Q&amp;A with Lendio CEO Brock Blake<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/freshbooks-vp-of-marketing-on-how-small-businesses-can-win\/\">FreshBooks VP of Marketing Bart Molenda on How Small Businesses Can Win<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a lot of ways, banking hasn\u2019t changed much over the years.
