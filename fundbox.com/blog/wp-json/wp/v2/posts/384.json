The form reports wages, tips, income tax, federal, social security and Medicare tax withholding, and other employment-related payments.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on your payroll system, W-2s can be completed in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/fw2.pdf\">paper format<\/a> and given to employees or processed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/employer\/\">online<\/a> and printed out automatically. This year\u2019s mailing deadline for W-2s is January 31, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve issued your W-2s to employees, be sure to ask them to check that all the information on the form is accurate. Any errors can be corrected and re-filed using Form W-2C.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you\u2019ll need to send a copy (Copy A) to the Social Security Administration (SSA) by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialsecurity.gov\/employer\/paperFormInstr.htm\">mail<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialsecurity.gov\/employer\/\">electronically<\/a>. The SSA will share this information with the IRS. The deadline for mailing copies is February 28, 2014, if you file electronically you have until March 31, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the W-2, you should also submit a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/fw3.pdf\">W-3 Form<\/a> (basically a recap of all your W-2s that summarizes all wages paid to employees and all federal taxes withheld). Again, this should be submitted by February 28, 2014.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What About Reporting the Cost of Healthcare Coverage?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Affordable Care Act has resulted in a change in W-2 reporting requirements, but only for employers who retain 250+ employees. These employers must report the cost of health insurance coverage under an employer-sponsored group health plan on all W-2s in 2014. Small employers (those with under 250 employees) were slated to begin reporting coverage in 2013, but this has since been delayed until the IRS decides otherwise. Read more in this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/p5187.pdf\">FAQ<\/a> from IRS.gov (refer to Q4).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Prepare and Distribute Form 1099-MISC to Contractors <\/strong><br \/>\nDid you use the services of an independent contractor in 2013? Generally, if you paid an independent contractor $600 or more in payments in 2013 or at least $10 in royalties or broker payments, then you must issue them with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/Form-1099-MISC,-Miscellaneous-Income\">Form 1099-MISC<\/a> (Copy B and Copy 1) by January 31, 2014. For more specifics on when you are required to issue 1099s, check out this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/Form-1099-MISC,-Miscellaneous-Income\">guidance<\/a> from the IRS.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to file a paper 1099-MISC, you\u2019ll need to use an original copy (not the PDF on IRS.gov) you can order these directly from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Online-Ordering-for-Information-Returns-and-Employer-Returns\">IRS online<\/a> or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM. Forms are also available from office supply stores.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed all your 1099s, you\u2019ll need to send Copy A to the IRS by February 28, 2014 (March 31, 2014 if you file electronically). The forms should be accompanied by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-1096\">Form 1096<\/a>\u00a0which totals all the information from the 1099 forms. Copy 1 goes to your state tax department (usually by February 28 also, but check your state tax department), Copy C is for your records.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Got Questions?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to consult a tax advisor or your payroll provider to ensure you have all your boxes checked when it comes to staying compliant with wage, tax withholding and 1099 reporting requirements.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tax season is upon us and for most small business owners it begins with the annual W-2 and 1099 reporting &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":385,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232],"yst_prominent_words":[4021,4020,4017,4016,4026,4015,4011,4023,4019,4018,3373,4013,4022,4014,4028,3360,4025,4012,4024,4027],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Is Your Small Business Ready for Tax Season?","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Tax season is upon us.
