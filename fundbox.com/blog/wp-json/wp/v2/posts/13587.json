To <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-business-owners-wish-they-knew-starting-out\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learn from their mistakes and successes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we spoke with eight business owners about how they\u2019re adjusting to the new normal\u2014and what they plan to do going forward. Here are their tips.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Don\u2019t be afraid to change your business model<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSince the COVID-19 outbreak, I\u2019ve had to pivot my operations from a conventional front-facing business to a 100% e-commerce consultancy. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I offered services traditionally delivered in person via instruction, facilitation, or coaching. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I missed the personal interactions and connecting with local businesses, but I\u2019ve enjoyed meeting new prospective clients online. My online marketing strategy has allowed me to have a broader reach than my direct market, which means I can connect to customers outside my market and increase my visibility.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Angelique Hamilton, MBA, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrchiquegroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HR Chique Group<\/a>, an organization that provides professional and business development and training services<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe strategies that have worked well for me and my clients have been those based on an early adopter or risk-taking mentality. Many of my clients have begun to explore how to leverage virtual service delivery to fundamentally change the way their services are bought and sold. For example, I recently worked with a client to develop a new service offering that involves a subscription-based health and wellness coaching package.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the clients I have that took the risk to explore telehealth\u2014not just as a survival tool, but as a new component of their clinical service delivery\u2014found themselves at a great advantage over clinics that tried to hunker down and ride out the storm. As we move out of the crisis, many clinicians are beginning to see the potential of leveraging technology to help patients improve their clinical outcomes, increase engagement, and improve course of care completion rates.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rafael E.

Pivot your offerings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNot only did we have to pivot internally to a 100% remote team, but we also had to pivot some of our product offerings. In February, we launched our in-real-life Sonder Circles, an immersive self-care and guided journaling experience for our members. During [shelter-in-place], our customers needed the intimacy and support of their peers more than ever, so we ended up transferring the guided journaling experience from IRL to virtual. Not only was this quicker to spin up, but we were able to access a much wider audience versus only specific regions.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Meha Agrawal, the founder and CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.silkandsonder.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Silk + Sonder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a monthly wellness planner subscription<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn May, I launched the No Small Business Left Behind [Virtual] Summit, focused on income generation and providing resources to small business owners\u2014mainly Black and Black women\u2014for survival. On July 1st, we held the second summit, where we focused on opportunities for brick-and-mortar business owners to think creatively about space use and marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe our Summit will continue monthly as we see attendees not just surviving but thriving from the resources, information, and connections made through our platform. The Summits have also benefited our speakers and vendors because they can share their expertise, make new connections, and acquire new clients.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Michelle Y. Talbert, the founder and chief curator of Her Power Space, a coworking space, business event venue, and podcast studio in Broward County, South Florida<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe were a high-touch boutique digital marketing consultancy. Many businesses cut their budgets significantly and could no longer afford the types of services we offered, but still needed digital marketing support and assistance. So we created a SaaS tool that creates social media content and posts to social channels automatically. The product can do it all: find the content to post, design the imagery, write the caption, and post at an appropriate time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We essentially replicated our social media management offering using machine learning so we could cut out the most expensive elements: the strategy and content creation hours spent by humans. This means we can still offer high quality social media assistance but without paying for humans to do it.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Khaleelah Jones, the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carefulfeet.me\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Careful Feet Digital<\/a>, a digital marketing agency<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy company develops event\/experiential technology, and because of COVID-19, all our events and brand activations have been canceled. So we started working with brands to create virtual AR\/VR technology to connect with their audience and amplify their brand voice and music. Reaching out and networking with brands during this time worked well. They were hesitant about what to do next, and they had a lot of time to chat and brainstorm new ideas on how to engage with their audience, which is where we came in.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Chynna Morgan, the founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/gifsoutloud.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GIF Out Loud<\/a>, a company that creates experiential technology for brands and musical artists<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examine your services and products to see what\u2019s no longer relevant.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brainstorm new ways to serve customers and clients.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experiment with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> services, events, and communication.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider turning your services into products.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Prioritize customer service<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCustomer service is imperative now more than ever. People are holding on to their income, so you have to work harder to earn it. My office used to use retainers only. Now we\u2019re doing retainers and monthly payment plans to make it easier for clients to pay smaller sums. I\u2019m also providing free online webinars to help potential and current clients.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Maria M.

Barlow LLC<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe number one quality I think business owners, especially those in the healthcare space, need to thrive in this new normal is empathy and understanding. You need to understand the needs, desires, and goals of your patients and clients in order to offer services that are seen as meaningfully different and valuable.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Salazar<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s important to appreciate those customers who are still buying from us. Even though our revenues have not bounced back, I gave our monthly paying customers a moratorium on their July invoices. They continued to pay us during the height of the pandemic and I wanted them to know they are appreciated and helped us through a very rough time. Talking to and cultivating relationships with our customers, operating relationally and not transactionally, is a quality to hone in this time and continue once we reach the other side.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Talbert<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask customers and clients for feedback.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/service-businesses-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customers\u2019 needs first<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by offering different solutions to their problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find ways to thank customers and clients for their support.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Take advantage of opportunities to innovate<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe mindset I hope to carry forward will be to try and cultivate the habit of seeing opportunity in the midst of chaos. Yes, the economy shut down. Yes, many outpatient and ancillary healthcare services were prevented from continuing in-person treatment. And yes, many referral sources dried up. But even in that environment, there remained opportunities to radically change the way the clinic did business, to expand into new service areas, to become real innovators in the healthcare space.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Salazar<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think you must continue to learn and implement new and innovative technologies if you want your business to survive, especially in this climate. As a business owner, it\u2019s your job to stay relevant and continue to evolve with the times. Make sure you\u2019re open and able to adapt to the landscape of your current market. You might have to reposition yourself in your industry, but the key is to create opportunities that will allow you to monetize your business during this time and post-COVID-19.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Morgan<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was shifting my makeup line to e-commerce from a brick-and-mortar business model, I didn\u2019t know how to build a community or how people would try on makeup without seeing it physically. But I went through some tech accelerators and grew my knowledge and the windows of opportunity swung open.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I have partnered with Algoface and I\u2019m providing virtual makeup try-ons to people who come to our website wanting to know which product matches their skin tone. We\u2019ve implemented quizzes to give recommendations to customers. My strategy is to utilize experiences that were unique to physical retail and make them applicable to the digital world. My goal is to make it a better experience to buy makeup online than it is in person.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Kim Roxie, the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/lamikbeauty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAMIK Beauty<\/a>, a vegan makeup line made for multicultural women<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for opportunities within your industry and business to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/economic-development-initiatives-reward-innovation-support-small-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">innovate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritize learning.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Improve internal communication<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The biggest change for me has been increasing communication cadence. As a former software engineer and product manager, I&#8217;ve applied the agile development principles of Sprint Planning and Daily Standups to my team. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every week, we sync and discuss: 1) what went well the previous week, 2) what could have gone better, 3) what we hope to achieve this upcoming week, and 4) any pressing questions or blockers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps our entire team get crystal clear on what needs to be prioritized and where collaboration is required. In remote team environments, communication is the key ingredient to holding ourselves and others accountable. At the end of every month we also discuss celebrations, challenges, and action steps. This promotes a culture of independence and ownership while simultaneously allowing for mistakes and learnings.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em>\u2013 Agrawal<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop a system for sharing team updates and asking questions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/running-business-remotely\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate frequently<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with employees to make sure everyone is on the same page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be open to learning.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Collaborate with other business owners<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen we took that initial hit of a 95% revenue dip within the first 30 days of quarantine, I became very insular and inward-focused. It was only when I began to focus outward, first by posting daily videos where I highlighted other women business owners and their products and services, and then by launching the Summits, that my own perspective expanded and my income increased. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publicly highlighting customers and other members of our community had two benefits: it kept us top of mind without making it all about us, and also endeared us to our community during a time of great uncertainty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d recommend connecting with other business owners to see if there are ways to pool resources, whether that\u2019s raw materials of production or one another\u2019s client bases, and offer bundled services or create affiliate relationships that expose you each to new markets. Also, seek out mentors and peers. Ask folks to meet for virtual coffee on Zoom. Give people you\u2019ve worked with good reviews on LinkedIn. Attend online events and connect in the chats. Add value and share your expertise and ask great questions.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Talbert<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connect with other entrepreneurs to discuss ideas, collaborate on projects, or refer one another.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find ways to support other business owners in their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7.

It\u2019s one of the most challenging eras of our time, and no one has a quick answer to ending the crisis. Continue to ask your customers what they need, and try to find the answers to solving their problems. And if you\u2019re in need of financial assistance, contact your local Small Business Administration office for available funding, and search for available assistance to help. Most of all, be tenacious and embrace the transformation. Personally, I\u2019m more determined to adapt to change. The crisis has allowed me to become more proactive in my planning instead of reactive to what is occurring around me.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Hamilton<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLook at ways to generate income from existing resources in your business that may be underutilized. For instance, if you have a brick-and-mortar business, you can register with an online shopping site, like Wish, and become a pick-up location for local orders. If you can\u2019t fill the space with people then use the unused square footage for inanimate objects, like parcels. Repurpose and rethink anything that isn\u2019t being used to make income because of COVID-19.\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Talbert<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s important that business owners have compassion for themselves right now and take a few days off. It might sound and feel contrary to everything going on around you, but that space can really assist you in thinking more creatively about solutions that can help you thrive now and in the future. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a few days isn&#8217;t an option, even a few hours a day for a week can help.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<br \/>\n<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013 Jones<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key takeaways:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on being resourceful and adaptable.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for ways to generate passive income or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ppp-loan-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">obtain financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritize your personal wellbeing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a business in this new normal takes patience, strategy, and resourcefulness, but it\u2019s still possible to thrive.
