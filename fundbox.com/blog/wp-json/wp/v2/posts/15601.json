Also called Latinx Heritage Month, Hispanic Heritage Month takes place from September 15th to October 15th, a time when we<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> celebrate the histories, cultures and contributions of American citizens whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFrom the businesses we shop at every day, the food on our table, the music we dance to, and the homes we live in to the doctors and nurses on the frontlines, the teachers in our schools, and those serving in our government, the list of contributions Hispanics and Latinx have made in this country is endless,\u201d said Rachel Matos, the founder and CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluelotuscollective.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Lotus Collective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the co-founder and CMO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycajita.com\/?SID=qoba4jefu2kmkkbtk1s4rp52e1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MyCajta<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity for businesses to pay homage to those contributions, Matos explained, and \u201clearn the origins of traditions and cultures that have greatly impacted our society.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are five ways your business can honor and celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Seek out and support Hispanic-owned businesses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hispanic Heritage Month is an especially great time to champion Hispanic and Latinx <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/minority-entrepreneur-funding\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to Stanford University\u2019s 2019 State of Latino Entrepreneurship report, the number of Latinx business owners has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gsb.stanford.edu\/sites\/gsb\/files\/publication-pdf\/report-slei-state-latino-entrepreneurship-2019.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grown 34% over the last decade<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, compared to just 1% for all business owners. Collectively, Latinx-owned companies generated $470 billion in revenue in 2016, but the average revenues for individual Latinx-owned businesses are still only half those of non-Latinx-owned businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cImagine the incredible impact if opportunities and resources for Latinx business owners were equal to those of non-Latinx business owners,\u201d said Matos.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business owner, you can help uplift Hispanic business owners and their employees in a number of ways. Here are a few ideas:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase office supplies and other business necessities from Hispanic-owned companies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a Hispanic-owned operation for one of your business needs, like printing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/content-marketing-local-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> materials or maintaining equipment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compile a list of Hispanic-owned businesses in your community and encourage your employees to visit them.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leave positive online reviews for the businesses you buy from.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Educate your employees about Hispanic Heritage Month<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big part of honoring Hispanic Heritage Month is learning about the history and achievements of people of Latin descent. After all, these communities aren\u2019t just rich in history\u2014they are also rich in diversity, encompassing a multitude of different countries and lifestyles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educating your employees can help them gain new perspectives, develop more cultural awareness and sensitivity, and reevaluate stereotypes. To help teach them, consider hosting a virtual seminar or lunch centered around Hispanic Heritage Month. You can go over:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The history of Hispanic Heritage Month\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latinx culture in your local community\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notable Hispanic figures in your business\u2019s industry<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important culinary, artistic, and political Hispanic influences<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Host an event that celebrates Hispanic culture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fun, easy way to participate in Hispanic Heritage Month is to host an event that showcases a unique part of the varied Hispanic cultures. If you have a brick-and-mortar workplace, consider hosting a movie night featuring films made by Latinx filmmakers, or a concert celebrating Latin music and dance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAnother way to celebrate is to host a potluck, where everyone creates an authentic dish or purchases one from a Latinx business,\u201d Matos suggested. If your employees work remotely, you could attend a virtual Latinx art show or concert, she added, or host a Hispanic heritage trivia game with prizes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Donate to a Hispanic-focused nonprofit organization\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donating to an organization that centers and uplifts Hispanic and Latinx people is a powerful way to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month. You can either support a handful of different organizations, or contribute a percentage of your business\u2019s September and October revenues to one particular cause.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To involve your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-motivate-employees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, consider matching their donations up to a certain dollar amount or holding a workplace contest. Whoever receives the best customer feedback or scores the highest monthly sales gets to choose which Hispanic-focused nonprofit they want you to donate to.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need a place to start, here are some organizations to check out:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hispanicheritage.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hispanic Heritage Foundation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> supports and connects Latino leaders in the community, classroom, and workforce.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/votolatino.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voto Latino<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a grassroots political organization dedicated to educating and encouraging voters.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/unitedwedream.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">United We Dream<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an immigrant youth-led community that works to protect immigrant rights and end discrimination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthyamericas.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Alliance for Hispanic Health<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a science-based, community-driven organization that provides health services to communities in need.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a good idea to look into your community\u2019s local Hispanic-centered organizations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Treat your employees to something special<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get your employees excited about Hispanic Heritage Month by giving them a gift that celebrates Hispanic culture. Think: a gift card to a local Spanish, Mexican, Cuban, or Salvadorian restaurant, a stipend for culinary classes or music lessons, or an artisan product.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matos said corporations used her subscription box service to order Day of the Dead boxes by the hundreds for their employees. \u201cThey also requested virtual demos and information packets as part of the celebration,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only are they educating their staff about this tradition, but they are also buying from Latinx business owners.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Celebrate with respect\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect time to honor and support Latinx businesses and communities. As you celebrate, make sure to lead with respect, be inclusive, and have fun in the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a business owner, one of the best ways to support different cultures is to participate in commemorative festivities, such &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":83,"featured_media":15604,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[],"yst_prominent_words":[723,875,719,1132,866,3760,3761,1157],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-left-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"5 Easy Ways Your Business Can Honor and Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect time to honor Hispanic culture and support Latinx businesses and communities."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"5 Easy Ways Your Business Can Honor and Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect time to honor Hispanic culture and support Latinx businesses and communities."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-easy-ways-business-can-honor-celebrate-hispanic-heritage-month\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-15-at-2.16.06-PM.png"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-15-at-2.16.06-PM.png"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1606"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"806"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Hispanic Heritage Month is the perfect time to honor Hispanic culture and support Latinx businesses and communities."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"5 Easy Ways Your Business Can Honor and Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-15-at-2.16.06-PM.png"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-easy-ways-business-can-honor-celebrate-hispanic-heritage-month\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15601"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/83"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15601"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15601\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15606,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15601\/revisions\/15606"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/15604"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15601"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15601"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15601"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=15601"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
