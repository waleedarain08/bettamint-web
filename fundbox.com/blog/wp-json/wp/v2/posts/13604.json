Here are some examples and suggestions for collaborating during the new normal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA sudden downturn in business takes a toll on a business owner,\u201d said Traci Bisson, the owner and founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ittakesavillagenh.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It Takes a Village Pet Care<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New Hampshire. \u201cAfter taking time to adjust to your new circumstances, you realize the way you used to do business may no longer work.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why it helps to \u201creach out, commiserate, and talk about what comes next\u201d with other professionals in your industry, Bisson said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.alignable.com\/member-resources\/coronavirus-report-smb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">May 2020 survey from Alignable<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, small business owners said the best recovery resource\u2014beyond <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ppp-loan-forgiveness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial assistance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014would be a discussion with business owners in their industries and communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s invaluable to have input from other business owners on how they\u2019re opening after COVID-19, said Gabriella Braddock, co-owner of <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thevaultstudio973.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vault Music Studio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New Jersey. \u201cThe ideas and gems that can be dropped during this conversation could be the difference between you being hesitant to open versus feeling empowered, educated, and confident.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019ve recently reopened or are in the process of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/plan-for-reopening-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creating a plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, connecting with local and faraway business owners can help. Here are five easy ways to collaborate with and support other businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Join industry organizations and groups\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can chat with business owners in your industry through online discussion forums, groups, and professional organizations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bisson founded the NH Pet Industry Professionals Group, where members \u201cshare ideas, tips, strategies, dreams, and goals for advancing the pet industry in New Hampshire as well as in their own businesses.\u201d Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the group has held online meetings to network, discuss new protocol, and brainstorm ways to address customer concerns, Bisson said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUsing Facebook Live and StreamYard has also been a great way for us to stay connected and offer expert advice to other group members,\u201d she added.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not yet part of an industry organization, union, or group, consider joining one or creating your own. Having a space to discuss the future of your industry with other professionals\u2014whether they\u2019re experienced or new to the field\u2014can give you the knowledge and motivation you need to pivot your business model or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upgrade your marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> upon reopening.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Connect with local business owners\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to talking with people in your industry, it may be helpful to reach out to business owners in your community. Braddock recommended starting a Facebook page for all the businesses in your area. \u201cAllow each business person to add their social media channels, their websites, specials, and promotions,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use the page to host virtual events, coordinate Zoom meetings, post COVID-19 updates, and share suggestions for improving safety practices and increasing foot traffic, Braddock said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How quickly your business recovers after <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/improving-business-while-closed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reopening<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depends on a number of factors, one of which is your community\u2019s ability to come together and support small businesses. Reassuring the community starts with local businesses supporting one another and being transparent about their reopening procedures, Braddock said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCheck in on each other, promote [each other] on social media, keep all communication channels clear, and hold weekly meetings to work together to ensure each business is fully covered,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to extend your reach, get in touch with your city\u2019s business council organization, join a local <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SCORE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chapter, or look for the Small Business Administration\u2019s closest <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/find-local-sba-office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Development Center<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These organizations offer resources like free business mentoring, workshops, newsletters, and networking events.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Partner with businesses for promotions and events<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/spring-cleaning-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with other businesses can help you boost your revenue and expand your customer base upon reopening. \u201cYou get double the brain power and double the network reach,\u201d said Bisson.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to other business owners in your area or industry to discuss the potential for collaboration. You could partner with another company to promote each other\u2019s services or content in blog posts or email newsletters, Bisson said. \u201cThis also offers critical backlinks,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-promotions are also helpful. If you own a flower shop, for example, you could partner with the boutique gift shop across the street to give customers a 15% discount code. The key with referrals and discounts, Braddock said, is to \u201cgive your customer base an incentive to follow through on that other business\u2019s offer.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnerships can also take the form of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-event-marketing-strategies-grow-business-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">events<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like teaming up with other local businesses to organize a monthly farmers market or artisan day. If you\u2019ve never worked with another business before, now is a great time to consider a collaboration. Thoughtful partnerships can have short-term boosts <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> long-term benefits for both businesses involved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Get involved in your community\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As cities and neighborhoods begin to reopen, it\u2019s important to show your support. Getting involved in your community can help you bring in new business and rekindle relationships with previous customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do that, Bisson founded the NH Dog Walking Club, a community outreach program dedicated to improving the lives of pets and pet owners in her area. \u201cQuarterly, we partner with a New Hampshire-based pet charity to create awareness and raise funds for their mission,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe also host live Q&amp;A sessions where pet owners can ask questions and engage with dog trainers, veterinarians, canine enrichment experts, animal communicators, pet first aid\/CPR instructors, sustainable pet care experts, and more,\u201d she said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of ways to participate in your community\u2019s reopening and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Depending on what your community needs, you could consider donating a percentage of your profits to a local charity, hosting a community clean-up event, or offering to sponsor a community member doing valuable work in the area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Embrace outsourcing and referrals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting other businesses shouldn\u2019t be a short-term goal, but a lifelong commitment, Braddock said. \u201cWhenever you are given the opportunity, outsource and refer to local small businesses.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run an architecture firm, for example, you could use local restaurants for your team meals or outsource your marketing to local freelance designers and writers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a good idea to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-ways-improve-referral-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">refer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> other businesses on your social media platforms, Braddock said. \u201cUse your stories and, if comfortable, your posts to highlight [someone else\u2019s] business and promote how it might apply to your client pool and follower base.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking the time to advance other businesses sets a good example for business owners everywhere, and helps foster a culture of support and community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaborating with other businesses isn\u2019t just a nice gesture\u2014it\u2019s a good way to rebuild your operations after COVID-19 shutdowns. In addition to promoting other businesses, focus on forming meaningful partnerships and participating in community discussions.
