Right now in the U.S., according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/smbs\/2019\/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research from<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PYMNTS<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, American small businesses have $900 billion in outstanding receivables. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did this happen? A lack of good funding options is a big part of what led to this situation. In the past when buyers wanted to make purchases, merchants (sellers) were essentially forced to act as a bank. Sellers of goods and merchandise didn\u2019t want to go down this path. They became lenders (extending trade credit, also known as net terms) so buyers could afford to purchase their products. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In today\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/welcome-new-net-terms-economy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Net Terms Economy<\/a>, in order to enable buyers to keep purchasing from them, sellers are enticing buyers with terms of 30, 60, 90 days or more. This means sellers are waiting months and months to get paid, leaving them without funds to reinvest in their own businesses. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Trade-Credit-Dilemma-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 research from\u00a0PYMNTS\u00a0and Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows that sellers say extending trade credit \u201cconstrains their abilities to make capital expenditures (29.4%), expand production (27.2%) and purchase inventory (26.6%).\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Net Terms Economy is not inherently flawed\u2014and it is common.

At this point, the situation is so familiar to sellers, it\u2019s easy to just shrug it off, thinking it\u2019s the status quo and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. But something can be done. You can escape the vicious cycle. And you may need to\u2014if you want to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow your business, reduce your costs of doing business and lessen the risks you face from buyers who never pay their invoices. \u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at how you can do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash Flow Issues Inhibit Growth<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sellers who extend net terms and aren\u2019t paid for weeks or months can easily encounter cash flow problems. You\u2019re likely familiar with how these issues can negatively impact your business prohibiting you from:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring needed employees; paying competitive salaries\/bonuses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding to a new location<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating new marketing campaigns<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in R&amp;D<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening new sales channels<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paying for production of your goods<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in new technologies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reinvesting in your business in general<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s much more difficult for businesses with cash flow problems to grow. Independent analysts found B2B sellers can, on average, increase revenues by approximately 25% to 35% if payments are received immediately and invested in strategic growth activities such as expanding production capacity, purchasing inventory in a timely manner, and\/or investing in new product innovation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increased Cost of Doing Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business survival depends not just on revenue, but profitability, and profitability is often lost in hidden ways, like wasted human capital. In some small businesses, most employees wear many hats. They need to invest their time wisely and effectively in the activities that bring in sales while improving profit margins. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it might be more difficult to do that when key company personnel have to act as bankers as well. Companies that extend net terms have to first spend time and money evaluating the creditworthiness of buyers who want credit. Then, if the buyers are late making payments, they have to chase down the money. This is a time suck, diverting time and attention from more profitable tasks and responsibilities. And if they decide to hire a collections agency, they\u2019re not going to receive the full amount due them\u2014plus they have to pay for the collection services.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there\u2019s the lost opportunities because sellers don\u2019t have the funds on hand to take advantage of being able to quickly purchase inventory, order more goods from their factories or qualify for early payment discounts from their suppliers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An independent analysis shows the cost of managing a net terms program can add, on average, an estimated 8% to 10% to the total cost of business operations. So, if B2B companies can escape the Net Terms Economy, the cost of doing business could be reduced by up to 10%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Risks of the Net Terms Economy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issues we\u2019ve already addressed\u2014cash flow and higher costs of doing business\u2014are the usual byproducts of participating in the Net Terms Economy. But, it not only costs you time and money\u2014it\u2019s fraught with risks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smaller B2Bs are competing every day with their larger counterparts, who often have deeper pockets enabling them to endure late (or no) payments. Bigger companies can offer longer terms, which smaller businesses mostly simply cannot match and stay in business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A small business could be devastated if their buyers default altogether, something larger sellers can more easily withstand.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, larger businesses may have departments and divisions with employees trained to evaluate creditworthiness or collect delayed payments. The salesperson who makes the sale in a smaller business typically cannot build a close relationship with a customer if they\u2019re also pestering them for payment. For bigger businesses, in general, extending terms is less risky than it is for smaller B2Bs. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if small businesses don\u2019t extend net terms, they risk losing clients altogether, since those clients can do business with the larger companies that sell the products they want and offer the terms they need. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to 2020 <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/ebooks\/frost-sullivan-the-future-of-b2b-commerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">independent analysis Frost &amp; Sullivan<\/a>, revenue losses from late payments, payment defaults, and customer churn range from approximately 6% to 8% for SMBs. And the probability of non-payments and late payments increases when net terms are given. To avoid these scenarios, B2B sellers often promote shorter-duration net terms, putting them at a disadvantage compared to their larger competitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solutions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some businesses may find this tradeoff pretty bleak, striking a balance doesn\u2019t have to be so costly. Businesses don&#8217;t have to rely on old-school credit solutions, like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-invoice-factoring\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">factoring<\/a>, working capital loans and credit cards. A\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business line of credit from Fundbox<\/a><\/strong> can provide business owners with the financial breathing room to keep operations going despite, despite irregular or late payment on receivables.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Using a business line of credit, which can be based on incoming invoices, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offers these possible advantages:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faster financing so businesses can get paid as soon as their work is completed.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continued ability to offer net terms. As noted earlier, if sellers don\u2019t offer net terms, buyers will simply move on to a company that does. But sellers need to be able to handle the risk of offering terms to customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to focus on growing your business, devote your energies to doing what you do best, it may be time to free yourself from being a part time \u201cbanker\u201d and explore a solution that takes the worry out of giving your buyers credit. In the end both your customers and your business will benefit. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s been a lot of talk lately about how offering trade credit in the form of net terms adversely affects &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":13303,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[723,1706,1132,713,705,2148,3919,2960,11073,1787,3842,11074,2102],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"circle","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Why Merchants Should Be Cautious About Offering Net Terms | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"The Net Terms Economy adversely affects small businesses, B2B in particular.
