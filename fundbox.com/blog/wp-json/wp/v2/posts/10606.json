Financial challenges, however, tend to loom the largest. Not only are business finances a complex, ever-changing entity, but they\u2019re also the engine of any operation. A good financial situation can keep a business running, while too many financial hardships can cause even the most pristine machine to sputter and stall out.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, improving your business\u2019 financial health doesn\u2019t come down to luck. The more you understand common small business pain points, the better you can learn to manage them.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the top five financial challenges facing small businesses this year \u2014 and how to overcome them.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Lack of cash flow<\/h2>\n<p>Managing cash flow is a perpetual struggle for most business owners. According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guidantfinancial.com\/small-business-trends\/\">2019 Small Business Trends report from Guidant Financial<\/a><\/span>, 33 percent of small business owners surveyed cited a lack of cash flow as their greatest challenge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a constant, regardless of the year,\u201d said Ken Wentworth, owner of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/mrbizsolutions.com\/\">Mr. Biz Solutions<\/a><\/span>. It doesn\u2019t matter how many assets you might have as a business owner. \u201cWithout cash,\u201d Wentworth said, \u201cyou have no business.\u201d Beyond covering major recurring costs like payroll and rent, you also have to pay business taxes, fulfill vendor invoices, and purchase supplies and equipment just to maintain operations.<\/p>\n<p>One way to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/improve-business-cash-flow\/\">improve your cash flow<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is to experiment with your payment processes. \u201cWork on stretching out when you pay cash for your purchases without being late,\u201d Wentworth said, \u201cand shortening the amount of time it takes to get your invoices paid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you typically ask clients to pay you in 30 days, for example, consider cutting that window to 15 days. Just make sure you notify your clients and customers of the change before the next payment cycle so they\u2019re not surprised or unprepared.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-design-invoices-that-get-paid-faster\/\">Related: How to Design Invoices That Get Paid Faster<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may also want to streamline your business\u2019 payment process so clients can pay <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">you<\/span>\u00a0faster and with less hassle, Wentworth suggested. If you don\u2019t already accept major credit cards, that\u2019s a good place to start, he said. You could also set up an online payment portal or accept payments through <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/get-paid\">Fundbox<\/a><\/span>, PayPal,\u00a0or Apple Pay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSending automated payment reminders is another easy-to-implement, yet effective measure you can take,\u201d Wentworth said.<\/p>\n<p>If you have clients or customers who regularly pay late, think about how you can incentivize them to pay sooner, said Matthew Ross, co-owner and COO of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rizknows.com\/\">RIZKNOWS<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/myslumberyard.com\/\">The Slumber Yard<\/a><\/span>. If \u201cone of your key customers has 40-day payment terms, why not offer a 3 percent discount if they pay within 10 days?\u201d he suggested.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to stretch out when you pay your suppliers. If the invoice says your payment is due in 30 days, pay on day 29, said Wentworth \u2014 and do it with a business credit card. \u201cDepending on your billing cycle,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat means you have an additional 30 to 45 days before you have to lay out cash to pay your credit card bill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you pay off your balance in full each month, though. Carrying a balance and incurring interest on your credit card isn\u2019t advisable, Wentworth added.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Sticking to a budget<\/h2>\n<p>Another common business challenge is budgeting. \u201cBudgets are absolutely key to running a clean operation,\u201d said Ross. \u201cBy creating a budget and routinely reviewing actual results versus projections,\u201d he explained, \u201cyou can keep a close eye on expense accounts and make timely cuts when needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In order to stick to a budget, though, you have to create one that\u2019s realistic for your business\u2019 goals and profit potential. If this sounds daunting, don\u2019t worry; there are many useful <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-free-small-business-budget-templates\/\">free budget templates<\/a><\/span>\u00a0out there to get you started right.<\/p>\n<p>To create your budget, begin by looking at all your sources of income to get an idea of how much money you\u2019re working with. Include your sales numbers, investment earnings, and any accounts receivable you have. Next, tally all your fixed expenses, like rent, equipment leases, or loan payments.<\/p>\n<p>From there, make a list of expenses that are subject to change from month to month, like contractor wages, marketing, travel, or office supplies. Finally, include enough money to cover emergencies and expensive one-off purchases like equipment or accounting software\u2014we\u2019ll expand on this later.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve created annual and\u00a0quarterly budgets, start scheduling monthly budget reviews to ensure you\u2019re on track. \u201cLet\u2019s say your revenue goal for the month is $100K and you see on the 15th that you are only at $30K,\u201d Wentworth said. Then \u201cyou can motivate your sales team to step up to close the gap during the last two weeks of the month.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Building and reviewing a budget regularly creates accountability, he explained, and also helps you make smarter financial decisions throughout the year.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>According to the Guidant Financial survey, 15 percent of business owners said <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guidantfinancial.com\/small-business-trends\/\">marketing and advertising is one of their top challenges<\/a><\/span>. \u201cThe three main online advertising platforms (Google, Facebook, and Instagram) have become extremely competitive,\u201d said Ross. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for small businesses to compete with the large, dollar-intensive marketing and CPC campaigns that large companies routinely run,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, some small businesses are being left behind. According to Infusionsoft by Keap\u2019s <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/keap.com\/infusionsoft\/resources\/small-business-marketing-trends-report\">2019 Small Business Marketing Trends Report<\/a><\/span>, 29 percent of business owners said they won\u2019t use digital marketing in 2019, while 22 percent said finding the time and resources to market remains their biggest challenge.<\/p>\n<p>To stay competitive without draining your cash reserves, you need to get creative. Instead of simply advertising, Ross said, try developing valuable <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\">SEO content<\/a><\/span>. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that if you create helpful videos that address related topics in your industry,\u201d you can improve your search ranking <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and<\/span>\u00a0attract potential customers looking for similar products or services, Ross explained.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Lack of capital<\/h2>\n<p>Cash is essential to keep your business afloat, but paying the bare minimum to cover basic operating expenses only gets you so far. To grow your business, you also need a healthy amount of capital to invest in bigger projects.\u00a0More working capital can free you up to focus on long-term growth efforts, like hiring, relocating, or purchasing a second business. According to this 2018\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.lendingclub.com\/the-state-of-small-business\/\">survey<\/a><\/span>, 49\u00a0percent\u00a0of business owners say they want to spend any additional capital on expansion.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of small business challenges, Guidant Financial ranks <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guidantfinancial.com\/small-business-trends\/\">a lack of capital on par with a lack of cash flow<\/a><\/span>. That\u2019s partly because acquiring funding can be difficult. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biz2credit.com\/small-business-lending-index\/may-2018\">Biz2Credit\u2019s May 2018 Small Business Lending Index<\/a><\/span>, big banks only grant about one in four small business loan applications. Though the approval rating has gone up slowly since the recession, it still hovers around 25 percent.<\/p>\n<p>The major limiting factor in approval seems to be tied to business credit. According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/insights\/?utm_source=Entrepreneur&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=american_dream_gap_report\">Nav\u2019s Small Business American Dream Gap Report<\/a><\/span>\u00a0from 2015, one in five business owners who applied for funding in the last five years were denied, and 82 percent of all the business owners surveyed didn\u2019t know how to interpret their credit scores. The research also showed that individuals who have a better understanding of their business credit score are 41 percent more likely to be approved for a loan.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to lay out a plan for identifying and improving your business credit score. Then, before you move forward with financing, get\u00a0clear on how you would use any extra capital and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/business-financing\/\">check out your options<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to see what makes the most sense to help you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\">grow your business<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Unforeseen expenses<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re already busy managing a multitude of recurring business expenses, it\u2019s easy to forget about the costs you can\u2019t easily predict. Think: damaged equipment, stolen inventory, or a broken AC system. In a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/accounting\/resources\/small-business-accounting-tips-2018\">2018 small business accounting survey from Clutch<\/a><\/span>, 35 percent of small business owners cited unforeseen expenses as their main financial challenge.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Ross recommended building emergency expenses into your budget every quarter, so nothing is a surprise or source of stress.<\/p>\n<p>How much money should you allocate for these unforeseen costs? Wentworth said your past records can help you better predict what you might spend. For example,\u00a0maybe you operate 10 vehicles for your business and need to gear up for potential repair costs. \u201cUse your expense history\u2014if in the prior three years, you spent $600 per vehicle for these types of expenses, then add $6K in your budget for that,\u201d Wentworth suggested.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, no matter how much you pad your budget, occasional <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/resources\/prepare-business-disaster\/\">crises happen<\/a><\/span>. When that\u2019s the case, try to figure out how you can offset that cost and bring your budget back on pace, said Wentworth. Can you ramp up sales for the month, for example? Cancel an upcoming work trip? Decrease your marketing spending? Unforeseen expenses are inevitable, but the more adept you become at predicting and preparing for them, the more stable your business financials will be.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Overcoming common business challenges comes down to education and preparation. Taking the time to determine your small business\u2019 pain points and lay out a plan of attack can help set you up for success.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From challenges with hiring\u00a0to maintaining product relevance, small businesses face countless obstacles every day.
