With Q2 nearly here, it\u2019s time to repeat the exercise.<\/p>\n<p>While you may think Q2 planning is all about prepping for tax season, there are a lot more activities you can add to your to-do list to help you stay focused on the right things and grow your business.<\/p>\n<p>Here are six items to add to your Q2 small business checklist.<\/p>\n<h2>1. \u00a0Create a (one page) business plan for the quarter<\/h2>\n<p>Most small business owners have a sense of where they want to take their business, but often overlook writing things down. A quarterly plan makes it much easier to get where you want to go.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this document doesn\u2019t need to be encyclopedic, shoot for a one-page plan instead. Start by identifying 3-5 goals or focus areas for the quarter. Then add the tasks that need to be accomplished to achieve each goal, critical milestones, who\u2019s accountable for each task, and the deadline. It\u2019s also useful to have one or two KPIs to track success against your goal, such as cost reduction, revenue improvement, reduced customer churn, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping your Q2 plan short and sweet makes it easier for everyone to understand where the business needs to go and their role in making that happen. It also makes it easier to refer to and check off key milestones and achievements throughout the quarter.<\/p>\n<h2>2. \u00a0Prepare reports for your tax preparer<\/h2>\n<p>We couldn\u2019t stay off the topic of taxes for long. If you haven\u2019t yet organized your most important financial documents in preparation for filing your 2018 business tax return, this chore is one to add to your checklist.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you work with a tax preparer or do your taxes yourself, assemble the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profit and loss statement<\/li>\n<li>Balance sheet<\/li>\n<li>Cost of goods sold (including beginning and ending inventory amounts, materials and supplies, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Expenses (marketing, utilities, travel, depreciation, business insurance, office supplies, training costs, home-office expenses, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Form 1099-MISC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Read more from the IRS on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep\">what kind of records you should keep<\/a><\/span>.
