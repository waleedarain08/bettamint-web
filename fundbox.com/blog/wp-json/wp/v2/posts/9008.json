Just invite your customers to transact with you on Fundbox Pay, and Fundbox will take care of the rest by providing your approved customers with convenient, flexible financing and net terms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<table cellpadding=\"25\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/get-paid\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8952 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/CTA0003-Vendor.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\/pay\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8953 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/CTA0004-Customer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2018, Fundbox unveiled a new payment and credit solution for small businesses serving other businesses (SMB2B) called Fundbox Pay. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":61,"featured_media":9020,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[],"yst_prominent_words":[8433,8429,1132,8423,8417,739,8418,8416,838,2897,8440,8439,3040,8441,1126,8412,8435,8420,8419,8434],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"circle","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"March Media Roundup: Welcome Fundbox Pay | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"In 2018, Fundbox unveiled a new payment and credit solution for small businesses serving other businesses (SMB2B) called Fundbox Pay.
