More specifically, 34.08% earn between $100,000 and $149,999, 30.04% earn between $150,000 and $199,999, and 21.52% earn more than $200,000.<\/p>\n<p>With the right plan in place and the determination to reach your goals, the sky\u2019s the limit.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12247\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_414437299.jpg\" alt=\"A crowd and several food trucks\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_414437299.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_414437299-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Challenges\"><\/a>Understand the challenges of running a food truck business<\/h2>\n<p>Building a small business from the ground up is hard work\u2014regardless of the industry. Like all small business owners, food truck owners have to worry about building a brand, selling high-quality products at good prices, finding good employees and keeping them happy, and making sure customers find the food truck in the first place\u2014and enjoy their experiences every time.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond those common business problems, food truck owners all experience a few other industry-specific issues when they\u2019re just starting out, van Moessner says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe biggest challenges are balancing your new business and\u2014hopefully\u2014customer demand with marketing and social media and having the right amount of ingredients, supplies, and customers on a daily basis,\u201d van Moessner explains. Technology, however, can make all of it a lot easier. \u201cUsing an inventory tool or POS system with data built in can help you predict what your staffing and supply needs will be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It can also be difficult to figure out how much inventory to have on hand at any time and where to store your food items and associated accouterments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFood and recipe costing can be really challenging\u2014especially if you\u2019re dealing with more limited food storage than a traditional brick-and-mortar restaurant,\u201d van Moessner says.<\/p>\n<p>There are also cash flow issues to consider, particularly since most food trucks are unable to take advantage of the economies of scale that some traditional restaurants enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou might not be able to buy your supplies in bulk at lower prices,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou also have to consider things like vehicle maintenance and fluctuating fuel costs, insurance, licenses, and permits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Permits and licenses <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thebolditalic.com\/a-closer-look-at-sfs-food-truck-industry-69a56055dc05\">don\u2019t always come easy<\/a><\/span>, either. For example, San Francisco food trucks need to complete at least 32 procedures to get proper permits. All told, each food truck needs 11 permits to operate legally in the city\u2014at a cost of nearly $3,500.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on where your food truck operates, you may have a different set of challenges.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foodtrucknation.us\/wp-content\/themes\/food-truck-nation\/Food-Truck-Nation-Full-Report.pdf\">recent report<\/a><\/span>, San Francisco food truck operators spend $28,642 to run their businesses each year while food truck operators in Portland spend $5,410 to do the same. Boston food truck operators have it the worst, paying nearly $38,000 each year to run their businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, competition can also be challenging. If there are an endless amount of food truck options in the vicinity, it may be hard to break through the market and end up profitable on the other side.<\/p>\n<p>As any small business owner knows, challenges come with the territory. With a solid business plan in place and the right approach to these obstacles, you can build a highly successful food truck business.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Finance\"><\/a>How to finance a food truck business<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re ready to face the challenges food truck operators face and you can\u2019t wait to start serving customers. But you still need to turn your idea into reality\u2014which means you\u2019ll need capital.<\/p>\n<p>Food trucks businesses may be cheaper to start than other businesses, but they still require a good amount of cash. A used food truck can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancesmb.com\/how-to-start-a-food-truck-business-2888645\">cost<\/a><\/span>\u00a0as much as $40,000, while a brand-new one can cost up to $100,000, for example.<\/p>\n<p>There are also many other kinds of costs to consider: vehicle repairs, a POS system, uniforms, supplies, gas, office supplies, a website, inventory, kitchenware, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Some food truck entrepreneurs may have access to that much capital, but most don\u2019t. If you find yourself in the same category as most other food truck owners, there are several financing options to consider.<\/p>\n<p>Silverstein financed The Peached Tortilla by raising $40,000 from investors and funding the rest of the business out of his own pocket.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe odds of me getting a substantial enough loan to run the business were not good\u2014I had no track record,\u201d Silverstein says. \u201cBanks look at food trucks or restaurants like high-risk loans. I had trouble securing a loan for my restaurant\u2014and that was after I\u2019ve proven myself in the food truck. Why would anyone loan me money for my food truck?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other food truck entrepreneurs take different routes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost food truck operators start with a mix of savings, crowdfunding, and microloans,\u201d van Moesser explains. \u201cFor some lower-cost operations, getting started is as easy as taking out a low-interest rate business card.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to finance your food truck business out of your own pocket, that can create a whole other set of problems\u2014even if you have the cash to spare.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSelf-financing has its pros and cons,\u201d van Moesser continues. \u201cYou can start your business debt-free and right away when you are self-financed. But it\u2019s easy to quickly run out of money without a backup plan on the long road to profitability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses\/\">Crowdfunding<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is another financing option food truck business can consider.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCrowdfunding is a great idea for food trucks because it also provides a crash course in marketing and a proof of concept before you set up shop,\u201d van Moessner concludes. \u201cIf you can get a community excited and bought in on your food truck and products, they will likely support you by purchasing your food once you\u2019re open and established. This also allows you to start your business with minimal debt.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still, even with financing in place, cash flow problems can always loom.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think what makes the food truck business challenging is the margin, the day-to-day hustle and grind, the amount of stress and energy you have to put in to be successful,\u201d Silverstein says. \u201cIf your volume isn\u2019t big enough, you can\u2019t go with vendors that deliver, so then you end up having to go out to a commercial warehouse to buy your products.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite these obstacles, with a solid business plan, financing on hand, and a contingency plan in place if you need more funding, you can grow your food truck business into something much more\u2014as Silverstein\u2019s story demonstrates.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Find\"><\/a>How to find food truck businesses for sale<\/h2>\n<p>If you dream of running a popular food truck, you don\u2019t <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">have <\/span>to start your food truck business from scratch. You could always opt to buy one outright, assuming you can find a seller with an existing business you like.<\/p>\n<p>A quick Google search reveals several sites dedicated to selling food trucks to entrepreneurs such as yourself. \u00a0But buyer beware: When you take over the business, you inherit everything that comes with it\u2014including the truck.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are very few food trucks in the United States that are running out of a vehicle that was built as a food truck,\u201d Silverstein says. \u201cUsually, there\u2019s a truck base or a truck shell that was an old UPS truck or an old FedEx truck and they\u2019ve been retrofitted. The problem with that is that they\u2019re old vehicles, they have a lot of miles on them, and they\u2019re not meant to support the amount and weight of equipment that is on the vehicle itself. You end up having a lot of problems\u2014transmission problems, chassis problems, tire problems, you name it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say that old trucks won\u2019t work. Silverstein actually built his own business on the backs of two retrofitted trucks. It can work, and it does work for many successful food truck entrepreneurs. You just need to be careful.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge gamble because you know you\u2019re going to have a lot of problems,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know how this truck was treated. It\u2019s got a lot of miles, so you know there\u2019s going to be a lot of repairs. It\u2019s just the nature of the business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12246 size-600\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_1095843908.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman standing in front of a food truck\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_1095843908.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_1095843908-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Equipment\"><\/a>Food truck business equipment and expenses<\/h2>\n<p>As you consider starting your own food truck business, you need to get a good idea of how much it might cost to run or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/truck-loans\/\">consider a truck loan<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily for us, the folks over at Food Truck Empire put together a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/foodtruckempire.com\/how-to\/costs\/\">handy list<\/a><\/span>\u00a0of food truck startup costs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The food truck itself\u2014fitted with equipment and branding\u2014can cost anywhere between $25,000 and $100,000<\/li>\n<li>Initial inventory costs between $1,000 and $2,000<\/li>\n<li>A point-of-sale system can cost another $1,000<\/li>\n<li>Kitchenware (e.g., pots and pans) can cost up to $2,000<\/li>\n<li>A website can set you back another $5,000 (but you can also build something respectable for less than that)<\/li>\n<li>A fire extinguisher is anywhere between $100 and $300<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are far from the only\u00a0expenses to consider. Permitting and licensing fees (and taxes) all vary on a state-by-state and city-by-city basis\u2014so set up shop accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need a uniform of sorts\u2014some T-shirts and hats might do the trick. And there are office supplies, marketing expenses, fuel costs, insurance, payroll taxes, and other miscellaneous fees to keep in mind as well.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"How\"><\/a>Step by step: How to run a food truck business<\/h2>\n<p>By now, you know what\u2019s involved with starting a food truck business, how much it might cost to get up and running, and the challenges that food truck operators experience.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re still stoked on the idea\u2014awesome!<\/p>\n<p>Here are five things to keep in mind as you get ready to serve your first delicious meal.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Choose the right menu and set the right prices.<\/h3>\n<p>If there are 20 food trucks in your city and they\u2019re all serving tacos and burritos, you may want to think twice about opening up yet another truck that sells Mexican food.<\/p>\n<p>Do a bit of research and see what kind of food truck businesses are in your neck of the woods. The more you know about your local market and competition, the better chance you\u2019ll have of standing out. One way to stand out is to come up with a menu that\u2019s unique\u2014something that your city\u2019s missing.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re happy with your menu, it\u2019s time to set prices. You don\u2019t want to charge too much, because you\u2019ll scare customers away. And you don\u2019t want to charge too little, either, because you won\u2019t make any money.<\/p>\n<p>Best practices <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dummies.com\/business\/start-a-business\/menu-pricing-methods-for-your-food-truck-business\/\">suggest<\/a><\/span>\u00a0targeting food-cost percentages between 20\u201340%. By this logic, if it costs you $3 to make an item, you would consider charging between $8 and $15.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Come up with a catchy name.<\/h3>\n<p>Like any restaurant or dining establishment, the name you give your food truck business can have a tremendous impact on your company\u2019s success.<\/p>\n<p>Spend a lot of time brainstorming potential names. Consider the theme of your menu and the vibe you\u2019re trying to convey. You want customers to be able to tell what kind of food you\u2019re selling with a quick glance. That said, you don\u2019t want to be too restrictive; you never know when you might want to expand your menu in the future, and you don\u2019t want to confine yourself in a corner.<\/p>\n<p>Your food truck\u2019s name should also memorable and easy to pronounce\u2014yet different enough to stand apart from other businesses. If the name is incredibly long, no one will remember it.<\/p>\n<p>Not super confident in your idea? Don\u2019t be afraid to bounce names off of trusted people in your circle for feedback. Your food truck\u2019s name is very important, so you should gather as much data as you can before you make a final decision.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Hire the right people.<\/h3>\n<p>You might create the best business plan in the world and have an even better menu to back it all up. But at the end of the day, there\u2019s only one of you. Unless you\u2019re planning on doing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">everything <\/span>on your own, you\u2019ll need a team of dedicated workers to help your business get to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing who to hire is another incredibly important decision you\u2019ll have to make. While the right employees will help delight your customers, toxic ones will scare them away.<\/p>\n<p>Look for employees who are reliable and friendly. It doesn\u2019t hurt if they are well-connected to the community either, because you can probably bank on some of their friends supporting your business. Great food truck employees will also have a working knowledge of the kitchen and will be able to talk in detail about the meals you serve\u2014what\u2019s in them, whether gluten-free options are available, where the food comes from, whether it\u2019s possible to customize the order, that sort of thing.<\/p>\n<p>Because this decision is so important, you should choose your employees very carefully. It\u2019s probably worth working really hard for a few more weeks if it means the difference behind hiring someone you can\u2019t count on and hiring a rock star.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Get your legal affairs in order.<\/h3>\n<p>The geographic area you choose to operate your food truck business out of will determine what you need to do to ensure you\u2019re complying with local laws and regulations. No matter where you wind up, you will have to obtain a food service permit that will need to be renewed on a regular basis (e.g., once a year).<\/p>\n<p>While each jurisdiction\u2019s specific requirements will vary, you\u2019ll generally need to register with the health department to make sure your vehicle is up to code and that your food is stored properly. You\u2019ll also need to make sure that your water supplies are free from contaminants. If you use a commercial kitchen for food prep, inspectors will want to check that out, too.<\/p>\n<p>The health department may also want to see your team in action. To this end, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll stop by your food truck unannounced to see whether your staff is wearing gloves and that foods are stored at proper temperatures, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to passing health inspections, you\u2019ll also need to secure business licenses, obtain an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/how-to-apply-for-an-ein\">Employer Identification Number<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for tax purposes, keep your vehicle registered and insured, and pass a fire safety inspection.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll have to familiarize yourself with local ordinances and zoning policies. What hours can you sell food during? Where can you park (in San Francisco, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thebolditalic.com\/a-closer-look-at-sfs-food-truck-industry-69a56055dc05\">food trucks<\/a><\/span>\u00a0can\u2019t be within 75 feet of a restaurant)? Are there any limitations on how long you can stay in one location? These are the kinds of questions you\u2019ll have to find answers to.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Embrace your inner entrepreneur.<\/h3>\n<p>Running any kind of business is hard work. Many people underestimate how much is involved in starting any business.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you only serve meals during the lunch window, there are all sorts of other tasks you\u2019ll need to tend to\u2014like processing payroll, ordering supplies, managing your finances, meeting with your team, networking with other businesses in the community, reaching out to media outlets for coverage, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Get ready to work like a machine. If all goes according to plan, you\u2019ll be able to hire more employees and delegate some of these tasks. Investing in modern technology can also help streamline a lot of business-related responsibilities\u2014like managing HR, processing payroll, keeping track of inventory, and even solving cash flow issues.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a good idea of what you need to do to run your business, let\u2019s take a look at some ideas on how you can effectively market your business to attract more customers and grow your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-600 wp-image-12248\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_516896896.jpg\" alt=\"People eating at a food truck business\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_516896896.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/shutterstock_516896896-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Market\"><\/a>How to market a food truck business<\/h2>\n<p>You might be thinking: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">If you park it, they will come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s probably not going to be that easy. Sure, you might open up shop and get passersby to give you a whirl. But if you really want to grow your food truck into a successful business, you\u2019ll need to spend some time and money marketing your operation.<\/p>\n<p>Here are six easy ways to do that.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Pay attention to your truck\u2019s design.<\/h3>\n<p>Wherever your truck goes, the eyeballs will follow. Pay close attention to the way you ultimately decide to design your truck and brand it with your logo.<\/p>\n<p>Your food truck itself serves as a mobile advertisement for your business, so you want to make sure it commands attention and is pleasing to the eye. Since your truck is the first thing people will see when they encounter your business, it\u2019s worth going the extra mile to make sure your design is engaging and appealing.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Get more trucks.<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ve got awesome branding on your truck. But there\u2019s a problem: Like you, your truck can\u2019t be in two places at once. If business is going well and the market wants more of what you\u2019re selling, you can buy a new truck, give it the same branding, and double your exposure.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have enough liquid cash to buy a new truck, don\u2019t sweat it. You can apply for an <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/equipments-loan-financing\/\">equipment loan<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to get the money you need to expand your reach with a new truck\u2014or even a few of them.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Post on social networks.<\/h3>\n<p>Everyone is on social media and everyone likes looking at pictures of delicious food (except when we\u2019re hungry!), so setting up a presence on Instagram is a no-brainer. You probably want to be on Facebook, too, because that\u2019s where all of your customers are. Twitter is another platform to consider. And unless you\u2019re building a food truck empire, you probably don\u2019t need to be on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>Grow your social network by offering unique deals and discounts to fans and subscribers who promote your business. What\u2019s more, if your food truck is mobile and not in the same spot every day, your social media fans will be able to easily find out where you are by following your status updates.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Use email marketing to grow your fanbase.<\/h3>\n<p>As you grow your social networks and build up an email list, use email marketing to reach out to your customers every now and again, letting them know about new offerings, special deals, and any events coming up that your food truck is participating in (e.g., a music festival).<\/p>\n<p>Tools like Mailchimp can automate many of these tasks, so you won\u2019t have to worry about staring at a computer all day and can instead focus on what you do best: serving your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Cater private parties and community and business events.<\/h3>\n<p>People are increasingly hiring food trucks to cater all kinds of events: corporate outings, weddings, birthday parties, baby showers, graduation parties, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Not only do these types of opportunities give you a chance to generate more revenue, they also present great marketing opportunities. Stack a pile of buy-one-get-one-half-off coupons on your counter and let guests that are interested grab one at their leisure.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Encourage word-of-mouth advertising.<\/h3>\n<p>More than 80% of customers seek <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/marketing\/numbers-dont-lie-2016-nielsen-study-revealed-referrals-01477256\">recommendations<\/a><\/span>\u00a0before making buying decisions. This is why word-of-mouth advertising is incredibly effective.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t force customers to advertise on your behalf. But you can take proactive steps to ensure they have great experiences\u2014increasing the chances they do.<\/p>\n<p>Be friendly, be prompt, and be courteous. Serve up great experiences to your customers on a regular basis, couple that with great food, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before patrons recommend your food truck to their friends and colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve built a great food truck business and\u2014thanks to your marketing efforts\u2014you\u2019ve grown your revenue considerably. Now it\u2019s time to expand your food truck business to get to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we\u2019ll explore exactly how you can do that.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_12249\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12249\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-600 wp-image-12249\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/CurryUpNow-and-Steph-Curry.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/CurryUpNow-and-Steph-Curry.png 930w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/CurryUpNow-and-Steph-Curry-768x491.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-12249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Curry Up Now scored a visit to their food truck from basketball star Stephen Curry, and got some big love on their social media, too.

It just might not be smooth sailing the entire time.<\/p>\n<p>After Silverstein launched The Peached Tortilla, he truly understood how difficult the food truck business actually was. Eventually, he realized that\u2014instead of driving around from spot to spot or parking in one location\u2014a different path forward made more sense.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe ended up turning to private events and kind of became this very food-truck-based catering company initially,\u201d Silverstein continues.<\/p>\n<p>That decision opened the door for more opportunities. After Silverstein proved his Peached Tortilla concept successful, he targeted expansion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe margins became a lot better. We became profitable and we were able to reinvest those profits back into the business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead of adding more food trucks to the fleet, Silverstein opted to follow the same route as Kapoor, opening a bona fide restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the success of his food truck, Silverstein had access to the cash he needed to open a brick-and-mortar location.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRaising money wasn\u2019t too challenging,\u201d Silverstein continues. \u201cI got a line of credit. I put my own money back into the business. I asked my investors to re-up and add more money to the pool and reinvest which they all did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely every business owner will have as easy a time securing the capital needed to expand.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re eying the next step in the evolution of your food truck business and need financing, a flexible <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\">line of credit<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is a good option.<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"Bestareas\"><\/a>The top 10 areas to run a food truck business<\/h2>\n<p>We all need to eat.
