While this is not a complex process\u2014you decide where you want to open your account, gather the necessary documents and apply\u2014there are a few additional steps you could take.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The advantages of a business bank account<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do you need a separate business bank account instead of using your personal bank account? If you\u2019re serious about running a small business, then you need to start your business professionally. That means:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never mingling company funds with your personal money. Never.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having checks with a company name on it<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making it easy for your bookkeeper or accountant (or even you) to keep track of sales and expenses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business bank account is the first step in establishing business credit, which you will need as you grow.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to accept credit card payments, you will need to open a merchant account, which you cannot open if you don\u2019t have a business checking account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your business a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), a C Corp, or any other type of corporation? Then, having a separate bank account is a must. Technically, a corporation is a separate legal entity. You don\u2019t want to breach that corporate shield, or you could lose the legal protections from personal liability being incorporated provides, putting your personal assets at risk.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But even if you\u2019re a sole proprietorship, you may still want to maintain separate personal and business bank accounts because it may make it easier when dealing with\u00a0 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business bank accounts have a different structure than personal bank accounts, and the application process differs as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How do you open a business bank account?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most other bank accounts, business accounts can typically be opened online or in person. Depending on the bank you choose, these options may vary. Most banks don\u2019t require a minimum deposit to open an account, but some do, so ask first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the basic steps you should follow when applying for and establishing a business bank account.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>1\u2014Get an EIN: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you can open a business bank account, you need to have an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/employer-id-numbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employer Identification Number<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EIN), also referred to as a Federal Tax ID number. Per the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), if you can answer yes to any of the following questions, you need to get an EIN:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have employees?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you operate your business as a corporation or a partnership?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you file any of these tax returns: Employment, Excise, or Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you withhold taxes on income, other than wages, paid to a non-resident alien?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a Keogh plan?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you involved with any of the following types of organizations?<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trusts, except certain grantor-owned revocable trusts, IRAs, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Returns<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estates<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate mortgage investment conduits<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-profit organizations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Farmers&#8217; cooperatives<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan administrators<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an EIN is necessary when opening a business bank account since it identifies you as a legal business entity. You can <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apply for your EIN<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the IRS after you\u2019ve legally established your business entity in your state.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a sole proprietor, you don\u2019t need an EIN to open a bank account; your social security number will suffice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>2\u2014Compare your banking options: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business bank accounts range from those providing basic banking services to those servicing more complex business needs or enabling sales transactions. First, what do you expect your bank to do? What will you use the account for? Standard banking services? Or will you also use it to accept payments? Do you need an account that offers merchant services?\u00a0Knowing the answers to these questions will help you figure out what features you should look for when comparing banks and their account options<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some things to keep in mind:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fees: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since business checking accounts often involve larger, more frequent deposits, the fees charged differ from those of personal accounts, so you\u2019ll want to compare fees closely to understand how they are structured, including:<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><b>Activity limits:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Will your business make frequent or high dollar transactions?

If your cash flow is steady, getting a checking account with minimum balance requirements may save you money.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\"><b>Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Will you need to transfer money between accounts frequently? If so, look for a bank account that allows free ACH transfers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Interest checking and saving<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Some business accounts earn interest. Compare rates and requirements to see if you can make a little extra cash through your account.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Merchant accounts: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to accept debit and credit card transactions, look for a bank that offers merchant accounts.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Online\/mobile banking:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Online banking is a convenient and easy way to bank.

While your EIN shows proof your business is registered with the IRS, your business formation documents prove you\u2019ve taken the appropriate steps to establish your business in your state. These documents, also known as your \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d or \u201cArticles of Organization,\u201d help the bank verify what type of business you have (LLC, S-corp, C-corp, LLP) and show who the directors of the organization are.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your EIN\/Federal Tax ID number<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name and address of your business\/certificate of assumed name\/DBA<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The date your business was established<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state in which your business was formed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state in which your business operates\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Social Security Number, address and date of birth, and that of any of other owners\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business licenses<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will also need to show\u00a0your personal identification when signing up for your business account.
