They\u2019re simply a series of informed predictions designed to help you run your business smarter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of business forecasting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The three most common types of business forecasting include cash flow forecasting, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sales forecasting<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and market forecasting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cash flow forecasting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimates the total amount of cash that will come in and out of your business during a given period of time. You can use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow forecasts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to plan for expenditures and debt payments, evaluate your business costs, adjust accounts receivable and payable, and figure out whether or not you need working capital.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Sales forecasting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimates the amount of sales or revenue your business is likely to generate during a specific period. Sales forecasts can help you order the correct amount of inventory for busy seasons, prepare for downtime, make strategic hiring decisions, and analyze your business\u2019s profit margins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Market<\/b> <b>forecasting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> predicts future market <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/2021-small-business-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trends<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including changes in your market size, customer demographic, or industry. You can use market forecasts to review your marketing strategies, assess your competition, and find more effective ways to reach your customers or clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business forecasting timelines\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business forecast looks ahead to a particular period of time, whether it\u2019s two months or two years away. In general, the shorter a forecast\u2019s time horizon, the more accurate the forecast is. Here are the three most common forecast timelines:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Short-term forecasts <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cover<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the next 30 to 90 days in your business. Short-term forecasting is a great way to identify your business\u2019s immediate cash flow needs, plan for production, and set a monthly sales or revenue target.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Medium-term forecasts <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">generally<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">look ahead one year. You can use medium-term forecasts to build annual budgets, set quarterly financial goals, estimate yearly sales or revenue, and explain your business\u2019s potential to lenders.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Long-term forecasts <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usually touch on business happenings that are several years out. Long-term forecasting tends to be more difficult because it\u2019s further out into the future, but it\u2019s a good way to map out your business\u2019s long-term <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, set yearly benchmarks for success, or create a five-year business plan to show investors.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to do business forecasting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting in business <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be complicated. There isn\u2019t one perfect method or formula to follow, but here are the general steps for getting started:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Choose your forecast type and timeline<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The type of business forecast you\u2019re interested in depends on your industry, business needs, and goals. If you\u2019re concerned about your business\u2019s cash flow for the next quarter, you may want to do a short-term cash forecast looking at the next three months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to map out a year\u2019s worth of revenue, a medium-term sales forecast could be helpful. Or maybe you want to pitch your business to a potential investor; in that case, a long-term market forecast would be the way to go.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Pick your data point<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business forecast needs a data point, question, or problem to center on. If you\u2019re doing a short-term sales forecast, for example, the question might be: What will our business\u2019s revenue look like over the next 30 days? If you\u2019re doing a long-term market forecast, you may want to see how the size of your market will change over the next three years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A central data point or question doesn\u2019t just inform the type and amount of data you need to collect\u2014it also dictates which variables you have to consider. If, for instance, you\u2019re forecasting cash flow for the next six months, you\u2019ll need to take the following into account:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the past six months<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business\u2019s cash flow during the same six month period from a previous year<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The various factors that affect your business\u2019s cash flow, including your accounts receivable, your expenses, and your payment guidelines<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Make your assumptions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A critical component of business forecasting is making assumptions. Assumptions guide your data collection process and dictate your testing methods, helping you narrow your focus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s use the same six-month cash flow forecast example as above. If your sales and production are fairly consistent, you could make the assumption that your business\u2019s cash flow will be equal or close to the cash flow from the last six months. On the other hand, if your sales fluctuate\u2014maybe because you run a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seasonal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> operation\u2014you might assume your business\u2019s cash flow over the next six months will be sporadic or negative.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Use the right forecasting method and tools\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two general <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forecasting methods<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: qualitative and quantitative forecasting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Qualitative forecasting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> relies more on expert opinions and customer feedback than numbers. To gather data for qualitative forecasting, you might poll customers, ask subject matter experts for their predictions, or consult your business accountant for advice. Qualitative forecasting isn\u2019t necessarily the most accurate forecasting method, but it can be helpful for long-term horizons and broad predictions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Quantitative forecasting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses hard numbers and data to arrive at a conclusion. Depending on the exact method, you might draw from historical company data, current company data, or market statistics\u2014or use a mix of all three. There are a handful of complex quantitative forecasting methods, but the simplest is time series forecasting, where you use past data to assess the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business forecasting can be complicated, so it\u2019s crucial to enlist the help of an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/find-right-accountant-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, financial planner, or digital forecasting tool. Most forecasting software integrates with your existing business solutions\u2014like inventory management or payroll software\u2014to give you the most accurate results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a combination of machine learning and complex formulas, forecasting tools take into account factors like accounts receivable and payable, purchase orders, inventory restocking times, and even invoice approval times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Compare your forecasts to your results\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting isn\u2019t over after you test your assumptions. The final step in business forecasting is to compare your forecasts to what actually happens over time. Reviewing your forecasts for accuracies and deviations helps you improve the process, so your future forecasts will be more reliable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you take note of the data points you used, as well as any outside factors that might have influenced your results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forecasting for success<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harnessing the power of business forecasts can help you make smarter decisions around your business\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, finances, and long-term growth.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
