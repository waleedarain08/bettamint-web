Collect a portion of fees up front<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s certainly not uncommon for small businesses to run into cash flow problems. Should any of your clients find themselves in such a situation, well, you know what that means when it comes to getting paid for your services in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<p>If such a scenario sounds all too familiar to you, it might be time to start considering asking your clients to pay a portion of their bills up front\u2014whether that\u2019s 10, 15, or 20 percent is up to you. After all, it\u2019s not a completely unreasonable request. As such, you might want to think twice about doing business with prospective clients who outright refuse such arrangements altogether without agreeable reasoning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Don\u2019t overextend your business<\/strong><br \/>\nIn order for your company to expand, you\u2019ve got to take on additional clients. While landing new accounts is certainly something to celebrate, be careful not to bite off more than your team can collectively chew. Remember, you\u2019ve built your business on delivering a high level of service to your customers. You don\u2019t want to grow too quickly and compromise on your ability to consistently provide that specialized touch you\u2019ve built your reputation on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Trim the fat<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen you scrutinize your personal finances, chances are you\u2019re able to identify a few ways to save money. For example, let\u2019s say you go out to eat eight times a month; if you went out once a week and cooked more at home, your wallet would be heavier.<\/p>\n<p>Your company\u2019s finances will be noticeably healthier when you put your operations under a similar microscope, so to speak, and see exactly how you\u2019re spending your money. Are you sure you\u2019re getting the most competitive communications prices? How much are you paying for insurance? Is your underutilized office <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/benefits-of-coworking-space\/\">really necessary<\/a>? These are some of the questions you might want to ask yourself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Utilize an invoice-clearing service<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re running into cash flow problems and have invoices that haven\u2019t yet been paid, it might be time to think about whether your business would benefit from using a service like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\">Fundbox<\/a> to advance payments on outstanding invoices. For a small fee that\u2019s repaid over 12 weeks, Fundbox gives you the peace of mind that comes with knowing you have access to the cash you need to help your business grow.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve all heard the early bird catches the worm: It\u2019s true. Those who are proactive often are the ones who get ahead.
