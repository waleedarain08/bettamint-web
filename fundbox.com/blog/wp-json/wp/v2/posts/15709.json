According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/jolts.nr0.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10 million job openings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the country this summer, marking the highest number ever on record. With more jobs available than people searching for them\u2014and with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/jolts.nr0.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">millions of Americans quitting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014small businesses are struggling to find and hire new employees.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To capture the attention of job seekers in the current climate, business owners need to stand out <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer the right incentives. Here are four smart ways to attract qualified candidates (beyond just posting a job ad):<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Expand your online presence<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expanding your business\u2019s online presence takes upfront work and consistent effort, but it\u2019s an effective way to draw potential employees in. These four strategies can help your business become more visible and memorable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Post frequently on LinkedIn: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn is the platform for job hunting and referrals, so it\u2019s a good place for employees to learn about your business. In addition to posting job ads and industry updates, you may want to spotlight employees, feature positive customer reviews, and share your business\u2019s accomplishments or achievements.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tap into social media: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-tips-planning-social-media-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the easiest ways to get in front of prospective employees. When you\u2019re brainstorming post ideas, think of how you can get job candidates excited while staying authentic to your brand and style. If you run a bakery, for example, you could share a behind-the-scenes video of how you make your croissants. If you operate a dental office, you could make an infographic that breaks down your employee benefits and workplace perks.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Improve your website:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your business\u2019s website is usually the first place job candidates visit when researching an open role, so it\u2019s crucial to make a positive impact. Start by revamping your landing page so it\u2019s visually intriguing, scannable, and informative. Next, update your \u201ccareers\u201d page with more information about your business, workplace culture, and employee benefits. You may also want to update your business\u2019s \u201cabout\u201d section or include relevant keywords throughout your site to improve SEO.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Alert the presses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive press can pique the interest of job seekers. Consider writing a press release to announce good business news, like an expansion or new product launch. You could also reach out to local news outlets to pitch a story about your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Share job ads with niche communities\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Posting a job ad on a job search website is like shouting into the void; your post can get buried under thousands of other similar ads. Instead of relying solely on job search sites, make an effort to show up in the places where prospective employees spend their time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by listing out the skills, qualifications, and experience level necessary for the roles you\u2019re hiring for. From there, research activities, communities, and groups that line up with the skills and qualifications you outlined. For example, if you need hard-working summer staff for your beach cafe, you could post a flyer at a nearby high school. If you\u2019re looking for employees with basic medical knowledge to work at your orthopedic practice, you could share your job ad in the local university newsletter or campus pre-med Facebook community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Lead with your values and workplace culture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees today have higher expectations for the businesses they work at. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/people-and-organizational-performance\/our-insights\/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majority of employees want three things<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to a 2021 McKinsey report: a better work-life balance, more flexibility, and more emphasis on well-being at work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To attract job candidates, it\u2019s important to explain <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/employee-appreciation-day\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what you can offer employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> beyond a paycheck. On your business website, in your job ads, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on your online platforms, work on the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Share your business\u2019s values: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees want to work for companies that align with their beliefs and support causes they care about. By openly discussing your business\u2019s values and bigger purpose\u2014whether it\u2019s to expand education or support your local community\u2014you can attract job candidates who will be excited and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-motivate-employees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">motivated to work for you<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Highlight your workplace culture: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Describe your unique workplace culture on your website and in your social media posts and job ads. Maybe you give employees flexible arrival and departure times, for example. Or maybe you encourage everyone to share ideas in company meetings or take a certain amount of time off every quarter.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Revisit your compensation structure and benefits package\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn\u2019t matter how often you post on social media or how widely you distribute your job ads\u2014if you don\u2019t offer competitive compensation and attractive benefits, you\u2019ll have a difficult time filling open positions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restructuring your compensation and benefits offerings may require you to drastically change your budget and company policies, but taking action now can pay dividends in the long term. Here are three tips:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consult your accountant: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To figure out what you can realistically offer current and potential employees, start by examining your finances. Meet with your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/accountant-can-business-cant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and ask what\u2019s feasible. Can you bump up the base salary for certain positions, for example, or give quarterly bonuses to employees who reach specific sales targets? It\u2019s also important to look at industry standards and check out what your competitors are currently doing.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/equal-pay-employer\/\"><b>Ensure pay equity<\/b><\/a><b>: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider hiring an outside expert to review your compensation plan for equity and inclusivity. An expert can assess whether there are any pay gaps, then give you practical recommendations for resolving them.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Reevaluate your benefits:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> According to a 2020 study from MetLife, a comprehensive benefits package is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.metlife.com\/content\/dam\/metlifecom\/us\/ebts\/pdf\/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number three driver of employee well-being<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To reevaluate your offerings, do some industry research or survey your employees to ask about their needs. Then consider what you can offer in addition to health insurance. The possibilities are endless. Think: extended disability leave, stipends for mental health services, reimbursements for fitness subscriptions, paid lunches, and additional vacation time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retaining employees\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding qualified employees to fill the gaps in your business can be tricky\u2014which is why it\u2019s critical to put just as much effort toward <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee retention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as you do recruiting.
