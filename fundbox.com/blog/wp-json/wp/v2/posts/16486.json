A Fundbox Line of Credit offers more flexibility than financing options from traditional lenders, such as banks and\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit unions. Traditional lenders can take weeks or even months to approve applications and release funds. Fundbox offers a fast, paperless application, quick access to funds, and flexible repayment terms. A Fundbox Line of Credit is revolving, so your available credit replenishes as you repay, giving you the flexibility your business needs to succeed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Fundbox Line of Credit, eligible customers can also take advantage of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox Flex Pay<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and get three extra business days to pay expenses and automate payments, ensuring vendors and expenses can be paid on time.
