The unofficial holiday reminds us to celebrate our blessings by going out of our way to do good deeds unexpectedly to both strangers and the people we already know.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a small business owner, you might\u2019ve never given too much thought about how your company could benefit from Random Acts of Kindness Day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But it turns out that a few small acts of kindness\u2014on the holiday or really on any other day, for that matter\u2014can have a profoundly positive impact on your team, your customers, and your community.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a small act of kindness?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like the name suggests, a small act of kindness is a minor gesture you do to put a smile on someone\u2019s face or make them feel happy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re not talking about giving a random person $100,000 or anything like that. Think more along the lines of helping an older person cross the street, holding the coffee shop door open for the person who\u2019s pushing a stroller behind you, or complimenting your waiter for going above and beyond and being exceptional at their job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are many small acts of kindness you can do that don\u2019t cost a penny, you might also want to leave that great waiter a large tip or pay to fill up a random person\u2019s gas tank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do small acts of kindness impact others?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of simply being a nice thing to do, exuding kindness can have a profoundly positive impact on our personal and professional lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It improves our health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/stress-management\/in-depth\/how-sharing-kindness-can-make-you-healthier-happier\/art-20390060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayo Clinic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, being kind to other people makes us happier and reduces our own pain and tension. It might even slow down the aging process, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When our minds are cluttered with negative emotions, it\u2019s harder for us to think clearly and make the best decisions. Being kind helps us function at a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/dont-forget-the-basil\/201806\/being-kind-others-benefits-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher psychological level<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which enables us to figure out the best way forward in any situation instead of making rash decisions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, studies have shown that being kind can be more impactful on the giver than the recipient. So, next time you feel like going out of your way to do something nice, don\u2019t hesitate to do it even for selfish reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It makes other people feel generous<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kindness is contagious. In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/11\/making-kindness-a-core-tenet-of-your-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">studies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that when folks perceive others as being kind to them, they are more likely to return the favor and be kind to other people, and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, not only will you feel healthier by being kind to other people\u2014you will improve <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">well-being, too. Instead of being an irate boss adding to their stress, your kindness has the opposite effect, and that effect can ripple across your entire small business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of a sudden, all of your employees become kinder overnight, which improves your company culture and impresses every customer that interacts with your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It makes you more persuasive as a leader<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a small business owner, you\u2019re tasked with getting your team to see your vision and trust you enough to follow you on the journey.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2013\/07\/connect-then-lead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kindness helps here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, too. When you are warm and friendly with your team, you\u2019re more likely to build rapport and camaraderie\u2014making it that much easier for you to convince your team to follow your lead.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some random acts of kindness I can do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wondering how to be kind this National Random Acts of Kindness Day, here are three ideas to get you thinking in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Write your employees handwritten thank-you notes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your employees are the lifeblood of your small business. How often do you sing their praises for hitting it out of the park day in and day out? In the digital age, a handwritten note is something that makes us stop and think. Spending some time writing brief letters to everyone on your team to convey what they mean to you and your business can go a long way toward bringing some brightness to their lives\u2014brightness that can persist for months and even years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Be more flexible with collecting client payments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every company has deep pockets. So, why not help the less fortunate? For example, you might decide to secure a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/podcasts-videos\/fundbox-podcast-chocolatier-pivots-during-covid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which would enable you to give your cash-strapped clients a few extra weeks to pay their bills. This is exactly what Strider, an online marketing and SEO agency, did to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/helping-underserved-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help underserved clients<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> invest in marketing without losing sleep over an invoice they needed to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Volunteer to help your local community<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great way to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day is by enlisting your team to volunteer their time to help support a local cause. For example, you might decide to clean up a park, cook meals for the less fortunate, or have a bake sale and donate the proceeds to a local nonprofit. As an added bonus, such activities double as team-building exercises, which can help you cultivate a stronger team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it boils down to it, there are an infinite number of ways to celebrate Random Acts of Kindness Day. No matter what you decide to do, just remember that there\u2019s no rule preventing you from being kind day in and day out.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 17 is Random Acts of Kindness Day in the United States.
