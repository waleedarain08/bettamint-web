Maybe someone in your building wants to share office supplies, buy in bulk or form a small group health insurance plan. Other businesses partner up to share rental costs on an office space.<\/p>\n<p>Still others partner out of a need to grow their client base. Customer referrals and new clients are a few of the benefits your business can win by partnering with another leader in your field. But how do you go about forging your first partnerships? Here are a few suggestions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Look for symbiosis<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you were shopping for your wedding cake, you might appreciate a shop owner who referred you to the best location to buy your wedding bouquet, right?<\/p>\n<p>Research companies in your industry. While you may not want to partner with direct competitors, find businesses you could forge a symbiotic relationship with. Maybe you offer consulting services to clients in a development phase and you could refer them to a partner who services them when they\u2019re ready to take action. Your partner could refer other clients back to you if they still need development advice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The approach<\/strong><br \/>\nHow do you reach out to a business you\u2019re interested in partnering with? You have to ask. Unless you have a prior relationship, it\u2019s going to be a cold call, but you can find the most personal way to reach out. That may be through a mutual connection or a contact form on the company\u2019s website. Try to reach out to the most senior executive you can get a hold of.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Promote, promote, promote<\/strong><br \/>\nCompanies are always looking for a way to promote their brand and there are more platforms than ever that brands have to pay attention to. Make marketing easier on a potential partner by promising to promote their brand across your platforms, including social media channels, newsletters, blogs and through word-of-mouth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set goals<\/strong><br \/>\nOnce you establish a partnership, it\u2019s necessary to outline expectations. How much business do you hope your partner will push your way? Are there any resources you could share to cut costs? How will you solve disputes?<\/p>\n<p>This may be a casual conversation or, if a lot is at stake, you may need to consult a lawyer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Track and re-evaluate<\/strong><br \/>\nDon\u2019t let your partnership become a one-sided affair, make sure you get as much as you give. Track the benefits and favors your partner provides. Is your partner helping you grow? If the partnership is costing your business in time or resources, it may be time to re-evaluate the situation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t stop at just one<\/strong><br \/>\nPartnerships come and go and generally last as long as it\u2019s convenient for both parties. Don\u2019t put all your effort into one partnership, play the field. Other businesses may offer more products and services than your first partner. You could even build a tight knit group of partners who work in conjunction to make clients\u2019 lives less of a hassle, earning each company repeat business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether business is booming or you\u2019re bootstrapping a startup, you should consider establishing partnerships with other entrepreneurs.
