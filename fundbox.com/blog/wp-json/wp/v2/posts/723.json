Do you have new investors? If you answered yes to either of these questions, it may be time to think about hiring a chief financial officer (CFO).<\/p>\n<p>But how can a CFO help a small business? Aren\u2019t they expensive? Could you do it yourself?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the role a CFO performs, when you should look for a CFO, and your options for hiring a CFO on a small business budget (as opposed to doing it all yourself).<\/p>\n<h2><b>What does a CFO do?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>A CFO can help you plan, model, forecast and make better business decisions. A CFO looks at your business holistically\u2013this includes people, processes and systems\u2013and ensures that together you have accurate financial information to plan for the future.<\/p>\n<p>A CFO also considers external factors such as the marketplace, your industry, and any socioeconomic, regulatory, tax, and industry issues that could have an impact your business strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Using this information, CFOs help business owners and executive teams make informed decisions. They interpret results, assess and recommend cost cutting measures and more.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, CFOs help steer companies by looking at the big picture.<\/p>\n<h2><b>When should you consider hiring a CFO?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>You may be wondering, when in the life of your business, is the right time to hire a dedicated CFO?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no one right answer to this question. It can depend on the industry you\u2019re operating in, and the nature of your business.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your business has many frequent or complex transactions, this might signal a need for fiduciary and strategic oversight.<\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps your financial data just isn\u2019t detailed enough to give you the insight you need to make important decisions. A CFO can help you decide whether you can afford to take on new employees, expand your business plan, or invest in new technology.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid growth is also another point where small businesses might consider the need to hire a CFO. Hiring a CFO\u00a0can help drive expansion across the business\u00a0and make sure that operations are optimized to handle growth. They can also help make a case for securing capital for growth.<\/p>\n<h2><b>What are your options?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>If you think you need to hire a CFO but don\u2019t have the budget to hire a full-time body, you can outsource the function to a management consulting firm.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, if budget is really an issue, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/mentors\">SCORE<\/a>. Sponsored by the Small Business Association, SCORE connects small businesses with business mentors. Many are experienced CFOs who want to give back to their local business communities, and they can\u00a0provide advice and counseling, for free.<\/p>\n<p>Just visit the SCORE website and search for \u201cchief financial officer\u201d in your zip code for a list of potential candidates in your area and industry.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10149\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/shutterstock_1100789435.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/shutterstock_1100789435.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/shutterstock_1100789435-768x492.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Can you \u201cdo it yourself\u201d?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>In a small business environment a CFO is a trusted adviser. Accepting this role yourself, especially if your business is scaling and growing, is a serious challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019ve mastered the basics of accounting, to be a good CFO you need broad technology, strategic skills, and finance skills. Perhaps more important, you need a broad view of all your business operations that will help you take your business to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>Stepping away from the day-to-day job of running your business to manage CFO tasks isn\u2019t easy. As your business grows and becomes more complex, would you trust yourself to assess the real risk of your actions, whether financial or regulatory? The role of CFO is often best left to someone who has experience in the field and completely focus on it.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t employ many of the principles that CFOs use to better manage your business and personal finances.<\/p>\n<p>Here are just a few tips to help small businesses and freelancers be savvy with their business and finances:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Track every expense: <\/b>This is common sense for business owners and a necessity if you\u2019re to claim the correct tax deductions. A CFO goes one step further, not just tracking expenses but analyzing them as well.

This blog offers tips on how to get the most out of a business budget.<\/li>\n<li><b>Be lean: <\/b>Controlling spending is half of the equation for better managing your business cash flow.
