Please join us in congratulating <a href=\"http:\/\/akhire.com\">AKHIRE<\/a>, the Fundbox <b><i>Small Business of the Year<\/i><\/b> for 2019!<\/p>\n<h2>Putting Alaskans to Work<\/h2>\n<p>AKHIRE (pronounced \u201cA K hire\u201d) is a full-service staffing agency based in Juneau, Alaska. Founded in 2005, AKHIRE serves more than 20 industries, locally and throughout the state. Always free to job seekers, AKHIRE fills a critical role in quickly connecting businesses with the hard-to-find skilled people they need\u2014for daily, seasonal, or permanent positions.<\/p>\n<p>AKHIRE\u2019s work is that much more important because Alaska suffers the <a href=\"http:\/\/live.laborstats.alaska.gov\/labforce\/\">highest unemployment rate<\/a> in the U.S., currently at 6.2 percent (compared to the national average of 3.6 percent, the lowest level of unemployment in half a century).<\/p>\n<h2>Weathering the Ups and Downs<\/h2>\n<p>Seasonality plays a big part in AKHIRE\u2019s business. Summer brings the most clients (such as seafood production, tourism, and shipping), yet winter boasts the largest contracts (primarily mining). These fluctuations in demand can create serious challenges for the agency.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cClients don&#8217;t always pay in a speedy fashion,\u201d notes Todd Saunders, CEO of AKHIRE. \u201cThey&#8217;re supposed to be on net 7 days, but people still don&#8217;t pay until about 45 or even 60 days out.\u201d Their Fundbox line of credit helps AKHIRE smooth the rough patches between income cycles that might otherwise shake up a business.<\/p>\n<p>A staffing firm is a cash-intensive operation. It requires you to cover the payroll, payroll taxes, and worker\u2019s comp\u2014both for the temp workers sent on contracts and your own employees. Even though AKHIRE might have to pay out $20K to $30K before the client actually pays, \u201cYou have to learn to live with the delay because you can\u2019t scare off the client,\u201d says Saunders.<\/p>\n<h2>The Fundbox Award and Its Rewards<\/h2>\n<p>Saunders appreciates the simplicity of Fundbox. The online dashboard\u2019s interface is very straightforward, and future payment is clear.<\/p>\n<p>To win this <i>Small Business of the Year<\/i> award, AKHIRE was selected from dozens of our best customers (submitted by our own Customer Service team), then narrowed down to six finalists, and finally judged by a diverse team of Fundbox employees.<\/p>\n<p>While coincidental, the fact that AKHIRE is an employment agency really hit home with Fundbox. Our company CEO and founder, Eyal Shinar, was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/zoe-henry\/jeff-bezos-investing-in-fundbox-50-million.html\">inspired to start Fundbox<\/a> when his own mother&#8217;s local staffing firm struggled to stay afloat due to <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/solution-construction-companies-cash-flow-problems\/\">cash flow<\/a> delays, despite having good revenues.<\/p>\n<p>The Fundbox <i>Small Business of the Year<\/i> award is about more than just rewarding one of our valued clients. As Shinar points out, \u201cThis award is an inspiring exercise that\u2019s part of our company culture, promoting an internal contest that gives all our employees an opportunity to learn more about our customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to AKHIRE, Fundbox\u2019s 2019 <i>Small Business of the Year<\/i>, now we (and the people of Alaska) are all winners.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All our Fundbox customers deserve kudos, but every year we like to recognize one particular company that really stands out. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":12745,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11504],"yst_prominent_words":[],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"top-right-risks","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Staffing Agency AKHIRE named by Fundbox as Small Business of the Year","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Fundbox recognizes AKHIRE as the 2019 Small Business of the Year, for its service as a staffing agency to more than 20 industries throughout the state of Alaska."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Staffing Agency AKHIRE named by Fundbox as Small Business of the Year"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Fundbox recognizes AKHIRE as the 2019 Small Business of the Year, for its service as a staffing agency to more than 20 industries throughout the state of Alaska."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/fundbox-2019-small-business-award\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/shutterstock_516700861-1-scaled-e1578352172891.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/shutterstock_516700861-1-scaled-e1578352172891.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Fundbox recognizes AKHIRE as the 2019 Small Business of the Year, for its service as a staffing agency to more than 20 industries throughout the state of Alaska."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Staffing Agency AKHIRE named by Fundbox as Small Business of the Year"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/shutterstock_516700861-1-scaled-e1578352172891.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@Fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/fundbox-2019-small-business-award\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12737"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=12737"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12737\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13692,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/12737\/revisions\/13692"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/12745"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=12737"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=12737"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=12737"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=12737"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
