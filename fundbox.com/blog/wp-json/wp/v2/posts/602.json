Gut Instincts or Hard Data"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>How do you make important financial decisions for your business? \u00a0Do you fly by the seat of your pants and go with your gut instinct or are you more methodical in your approach? Sometimes our instincts can be right. They can also be great at spurring us on to move things forward, especially when making important financial decisions about our <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-indicator-financial-health\/\">business health<\/a>. It&#8217;s never an easy decision to know whether to trust your gut instincts or hard data to move your business forward.<\/p>\n<p>Trusting our gut instinct is a common practice among entrepreneurs and small business owners. According to a poll by the UK\u2019s Daily Telegraph of more than 2,000 small companies, more than half of entrepreneurs (56%) admitted to relying on gut instinct to make key business decisions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Merits of Going with Your Gut<\/strong><br \/>\nThe results of the Telegraph\u2019s poll also suggest that one of the strengths of small business owners is that they can think on their feet and be more flexible when opportunities emerge. \u00a0Take Jo Malone, for example. The powerhouse perfume business owner who sold her \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jomalone.com\/\">Jo Malone<\/a>\u201d brand to Estee Lauder in 1999:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<i>My gut instinct is something I rely on every day \u2014 with the packaging of the product, for example. My instinct is telling me one thing and reality is telling something else. I rely on my gut instinct all the time in business. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, I\u2019m not going to do it, which can be very tricky in a team and in a small business<\/i>,\u201d she told the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/06\/10\/business\/global\/10iht-manager10.html?_r=0\">New York Times<\/a>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That being said, Malone is not shy about the dangers of relying on your gut:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I\u2019ll run with something because I truly believe it. If it goes wrong, it\u2019s on my head and I\u2019ll have to take responsibility for that, and I do. But when it\u2019s an entrepreneurial business I can already see the product, see the shop opening in New York. I\u2019m already there in my mind, and the reality is that I sometimes jump too quickly for the business and for the people in it.<\/i>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So how do you reach a happy medium of being propelled forward by your gut, without jumping in too fast and bringing your business crashing down with you?<\/p>\n<p>It all starts with knowing your numbers (aka analytics).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Drive Business Decisions with Analytics<\/strong><br \/>\nWe all make gut decisions in our personal and business lives \u2013 such as taking a new job or choosing one route to a destination over another. But these decisions are usually made when you only have so much information to go on.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not an excuse in business. With the amount of supporting data you have at your fingers, there\u2019s no reason to ignore your financials when making decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re planning on bringing on a new employee, budgeting for a marketing campaign, investing in a new product line, or just restocking inventory \u2013 listen to your gut, but be sure to wrap your arms around your financials too.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much do you make?<\/li>\n<li>How much do you sell?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your cash flow cycle?<\/li>\n<li>What trends are you seeing?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use your accounting dashboards, talk to your accountant \u2013 use all the tools you can to enable better decision making. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do historic sales trends and forecasts support your decision to stockpile inventory ahead of busy season or in support of a product push?<\/li>\n<li>Is your cash flow sufficiently positive to ensure that you can make a new employee\u2019s payroll each month?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s your true <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.fundinggates.com\/2014\/02\/understanding-cogs\/\">cost-of-goods-sold (COGS<\/a>) and how is that impacting the profitability of current and future business lines?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-indicator-financial-health\/\">blog<\/a> for some other key financial indicators and the decisions they can help inform.<\/p>\n<p>If you review your financial statements on a weekly or monthly basis, alongside your instincts, this is your roadmap to success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How do you make important financial decisions for your business? \u00a0Do you fly by the seat of your pants and &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3127,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[723,4140,719,713,4145,3382,978,4138,4137,4135,4142,4136,4141,4144,4139,4143,1472,1657,712,709],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Gut Instincts or Hard Data - What do You Trust Most?","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Its not easy to know when to trust gut instincts or hard data.
