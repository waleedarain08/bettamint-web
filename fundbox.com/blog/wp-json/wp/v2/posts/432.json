During the Hangout, CPA and tax expert Greg Lemons (of <a href=\"http:\/\/pbsfranklintn.com\/\">Padgett Business Services<\/a>) covered a ton of topics and answered questions from new and established small business owners alike.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve got questions about your small business tax return or tax strategies in general, you can bet Greg covered them.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, here are some of Greg\u2019s top tips:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0Were there any tax changes in 2013 that impact my small business?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to stay up to date on what\u2019s going on out there, \u2026without getting too technical the best thing is to get with a professional because they\u2019re aware of these changes, as they happen. On the business side, other than <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/obamacare-mean-business-cash-flow\/\">Obamacare<\/a>, there are really not a lot of big changes out there for 2013,\u201d explains Greg. \u201cHowever, there are several personal tax credits that are set to expire.\u201d When in doubt, consult a pro.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\u00a0How can a small business set itself up for a hassle-free tax season?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cThe most important thing is to maximize your deductions\u2026and, in order to do that, you&#8217;ve got to maintain a proper set of books and records,\u201d explains Greg. \u201cThis means using financial software, reconciling your bank account every month \u2026it\u2019s not an annual or tax season event, it\u2019s a monthly event.\u201d An accountant or tax advisor can help with this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\u00a0Who can help me maintain a solid set of small business books?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cThere are a lot of small business accounting firms out there. Interview them, talk to them, gauge costs. Depending on the size and complexity of your business you can pay as low as $200 a month for basic accounting and book keeping services.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> Greg stresses the importance quality of service. For example, his firm offers monthly financial statements as well as advice on how to use these tools to run your business. \u201cI want my clients to manage their business \u2026 over the year\u2019s businesses change, different challenges present themselves, and understanding how those impact you financially is going to make you a better business owner and more profitable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\u00a0What are the pros and cons of using DIY tax software?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cDo it yourself software is actually pretty good, I used it myself for a lot of years. But the big difference is I know what I\u2019m looking for, I know what to enter, and I know how to find the information to enter. The problem with someone who doesn&#8217;t know what they\u2019re doing is that the software can\u2019t tell you what numbers to put in,\u201d said Greg.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time I have a new or existing client walk in, I sit down and interview them and dig down into what has happened in their life (or business) during the year. This can help determine their eligibility for certain deductions. There\u2019s no way a piece of software is going to be able to do that for you. You have to have that understanding, going into it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> Greg offered this case scenario as an example where having a tax pro on hand can really save you money:<br \/>\n\u201cThe other day a lady walked in who\u2019d used a DIY piece of software, it was showing that she owed $2,500 and she didn\u2019t feel that was right. She came in and I got it down to $1,000 because I saw some things she was missing. We\u2019re also in the process of filing an amended return for the last couple of years and are getting her some more money back because it was a repeated error that she had made.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.\u00a0What are some typical tax deductions errors that small businesses make?<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the most abused (and error-ridden) deductions that small businesses make, explains Greg, is business use of the automobile and associated record keeping, or lack of:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe IRS wants you to have a mileage log to track business miles. You can either do a <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tools\/tax-tips\/Small-Business-Taxes\/Business-Use-of-Vehicles\/INF12071.html\">mileage deduction or do an actual deduction<\/a>, based on those miles. The problem is that most people will try and estimate it at the end of the year\u2026 if you\u2019re estimating and guessing you\u2019re probably going to cheat yourself out of a tax deduction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Tip<\/i><\/b>: Mileage costs can be expensed for all manner of business travel reasons \u2013 whether it\u2019s travelling to a conference, training venue, or client meeting. You can also deduct tolls and parking as a business expense. Use your odometer to calculate your exact mileage. There are also numerous smart phone apps that make the per-trip mileage calculation a breeze.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6.\u00a0What do I need to know about claiming the small business home office deduction?<\/strong><br \/>\nWith this one you really need to understand the IRS definition of a home office, explains Greg: \u201cThe area has to be used exclusively for business\u2026it could be a separate room or a desk in the corner of an office. The reason for the exclusivity rule is so that you can\u2019t write-off the bonus room with the ping pong table and the big screen TV just because you\u2019ve got a desk in there!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> To calculate the deduction, take the square footage of the house and the square footage of the office space, then take a percentage of your expenses (rent, insurance, utilities, etc.). Read more in our blog: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-claim-small-business-tax-deductions-for-your-home-based-business\/\">How to Claim Small Business Tax Deductions for your Home-Based Business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7.\u00a0What tax deductions might get you into trouble?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cMeals and entertainment\u2026 are some of the more commonly abused deductions that we see. Basically, anytime you have a meal and you\u2019re talking business, whether with a client, employees or a professional advisor \u2013 that would be a valid deduction. Some of the problems we see are with family businesses, who claim that every meal involves a business discussion! Well, I go back to the IRS definition of business deduction \u2013 is it \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed\/Deducting-Business-Expenses\">reasonable and necessary<\/a>\u201d? It\u2019s not reasonable to claim that every lunch is a business meal,\u201d said Greg.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tip:<\/em><\/strong> The only time a personal meal, where it\u2019s just you, qualifies as a deduction is if you\u2019re on overnight business travel and are grabbing a bite to eat. But keep your receipts (and for business meetings, make a note of who you dined with, the business purpose and date).<\/p>\n<p><strong>8.\u00a0What happens during a tax audit?<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cFirst of all you\u2019ll get a nastygram from the IRS! You\u2019ll be told when you need to respond or pay the difference by. Audits can go from one line on a tax return to the whole thing,\u201d explains Greg.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> In the event of an audit, your best defense is to ensure you have accurate books and records in the first place. Then, if you\u2019re targeted for an audit, you should be covered. Greg recommends keeping tax records for seven years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9.\u00a0Does every business need to file a business tax return?<\/strong><br \/>\nAs Greg explains, if you&#8217;ve earned more than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p334\/ch01.html#en_US_2013_publink1000313173\">IRS-defined minimum income threshold<\/a> during the business year, you\u2019ll need to file a return. Likewise, if you receive a 1099 form in the mail from a client, you\u2019ll definitely need to file.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you have very little income, or no income, you may have some expenses, especially if you\u2019re a start-up. Let\u2019s say you start a business on December 1<sup>st<\/sup>, you\u2019ll have a whole load of expenses even though your revenue has started coming in and should file a return.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The April 15 tax deadline is rapidly approaching and the blogosphere is lit up with advice and\u00a0tax tips for small &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":435,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232],"yst_prominent_words":[3940,723,719,3937,3935,3941,3945,3938,3038,3374,3943,712,709,3939,3942,3259,3936,1391,3434,3944],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"9 Year-End Tax Tips for Small Business Owners | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"As April 15 tax deadline is rapidly approaching here are our top 9 tax tips for small business owners.
