There are more than <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/infographic-the-state-of-us-small-businesses-2013-9\">28 million small businesses<\/a> in the U.S., which means over 13 million of them have cash flow concerns! Even more worrying, 55% of microbusinesses (those with 5 or fewer employees) don\u2019t have enough cash set aside to cover one month\u2019s worth of expenses! Setting up a business savings account is an often-overlooked cushion that offers several benefits:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It can help you stay ahead of cash flow demands<\/li>\n<li>It helps you set aside a percentage of your income to pay your estimated taxes each quarter<\/li>\n<li>The cash invested can bail you out in emergencies and cover unexpected expenses<\/li>\n<li>Finally, opening a business savings account is a great way to build your business credit rating because it demonstrates to banks that you have the means to pay back borrowed capital.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Here are a few best practices for starting and managing a savings plan:<\/p>\n<p><strong>How Much Do You Need To Save?<\/strong><br \/>\nMost financial planners recommend that individuals and business owners have 3-6 months of savings in place to cover their expenses. It really depends on your personal comfort level, A good rule of thumb is to start small and make it a habit, and then increase it over time. Set a goal for yourself. How much do you want to save and by when? Then budget accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Compare Business Savings Account Products<\/strong><br \/>\nDo your research to ensure you\u2019re getting the best interest rates, features, etc. It\u2019s often a good idea to open a savings account with another institution, not your regular bank \u2013 it helps establish a clear separation between checking and savings. You can compare rates on business savings accounts\u00a0from banks and credit unions using this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.depositaccounts.com\/savings\/business-savings-accounts.html\">tool<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.depositaccounts.com\/\">DepositAccounts.com<\/a>. Don\u2019t get hung up on comparing interest rates, at the end of the day this is not a retirement savings account, it\u2019s rather a source of ready cash, should you need it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transfer a Fixed Amount Each Month<\/strong><br \/>\nA simple and automated way to save is to set-up a regular transfer from your checking account to your savings account. Most savings accounts can be linked to your checking account (even across different financial institutions) making the transfer of cash easy. This can also help eliminate some of the fees that banks charge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deposit Your Tax Refunds into the Account<\/strong><br \/>\nDon\u2019t just blow your tax refund on a vacation or new TV, deposit the funds directly into your business savings account. Think of it this way, a refund isn\u2019t new money; it\u2019s simply cash you\u2019ve already made that\u2019s been handed back to you. Use this \u201cfound\u201d money wisely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reduce Expenses and Invest the Savings<\/strong><br \/>\nReducing your business expenses is a key part of improving cash flow. The less you have going out, the better. If you can afford to, pay the cash that you save into your savings account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Build Savings into Your Business Budget<\/strong><br \/>\nAdd a line item to your business budget to ensure that you set aside the appropriate funds each month and don\u2019t spend it on other items!<\/p>\n<p>A savings account is a great way to build-up cash reserves, but don\u2019t forget that cash flow management needs to be tackled from many angles \u2013from <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-ways-to-find-fix-small-business-cash-flow-problems-before-its-too-late\/\">identifying and fixing the reasons behind your cash flow issues<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/switching-to-online-accounting-software-why-and-how\/\">making the switch to online accounting software<\/a>, and using <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-apps-tools-manage-your-cash-flow\/\">tools and apps to manage your cash flow on the road<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\">more<\/a>.
