Whether you have your own contract or are asked to agree to your client\u2019s contract \u2013 pay attention to the language and terms. If you have a problem with anything, such as how frequently you can invoice and payment terms, speak up. Now is when you have the most leverage. Your client is eager to start the project and may be willing to make some tweaks to accommodate your demands. You may also want to build in other items such as kill fees, late fees, milestone payments, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The skill is to avoid any ambiguity in the contract so that both parties are clear about what\u2019s expected and what should happen if the contract is cancelled, you are paid late, or scope creep is introduced to the engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice invoice hygiene<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big reason for cash flow woes among freelancers is not getting paid on time. Most clients have payment terms of 30, 45, or even 60-days. In addition, many clients still pay by check which can easily add another week to the process. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bill.com\/about-us\/press-release\/billcom-survey-reveals-gig-economy-workers-prefer-clients-use-digital\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Bill.com found that 54% of freelancers say it takes too long to get their money and 45% say clients don\u2019t pay them on time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help mitigate the risk of late payments, invoice promptly and accurately. If you can, don\u2019t wait until the end of the month. Either bill your clients once the project is complete or invoice twice monthly (if your contract permits it). Always include as much detail as you can on your invoice so that there\u2019s no push back or delays. Detail the hours you worked, your hourly rate, a PO number if issued, project specifics, and your client point of contact so that accounts payable knows who to turn to for approvals. Most importantly, include your payment terms. This will give you extra leverage to chase late payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, keep a spreadsheet showing all submitted invoices. Record the date, invoice number, client, amount, and project specifics and if payment has been received. Check your spreadsheet regularly and chase any amounts that are past due.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Set money aside for your estimated taxes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Estimated taxes are paid quarterly to the federal and state government. Yet many new freelancers aren\u2019t aware that they are required to make these payments as they go and are caught with a hefty tax bill at the end of the year. Even seasoned freelancers can get caught out if they don\u2019t plan for those quarterly payments and find themselves with an unexpected cash flow crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most efficient way to avoid both scenarios is to save as you go. Instead of pocketing your earnings and spending it all, consider opening a separate bank account and depositing 30-35% of your revenue each month or on a schedule that works for you. You can then draw on this cash to pay your estimated taxes without feeling the pinch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Consider forming an S Corporation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most freelancers operate as sole proprietorships, and, while the administrative burden may be minimal, the tax obligation can be significant. Sole proprietors pay 100% of their self-employment taxes and are taxed on all profits of the business, less deductible expenses \u2013 this can put a huge strain on your cash resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forming your business as a limited liability company (LLC) and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/s-corporations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electing to become an S corporation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the eyes of the IRS could help you realize savings. When structured as an S corporation, as the business owner, you are treated as an employee and draw a salary from the profits of your business. In this scenario, only your wages are subject to self-employment tax. The remaining profits are then distributed to you as dividends on which you pay personal income tax.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An S corporation is not right for every freelancer. It all really depends on your income level, the tax bracket you occupy, and willingness to deal with the additional paperwork and state fees. You may also need to retain the services of a tax advisor or accountant to help you meet all your administrative responsibilities. Talk to a pro before you make the leap.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Reduce your tax burden with an SEP retirement plan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to reduce your taxable income, preserve cash, and plan for your future is to open a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plan or SEP-IRA. Unlike a traditional IRA, a SEP lets you contribute more to the plan each year \u2013 up to 25% of your total income or $57,000 (refer to the IRS for the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-seps-contributions#:~:text=How%20much%20can%20I%20contribute,living%20adjustments%20for%20later%20years).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">latest contribution limits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Compare that to the current IRA limit of $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great benefit of a SEP is that you can vary your contributions for the tax year up until tax-day. If you have a profitable month, go ahead and put more money into your SEP (as long as you don\u2019t go over the limit). Plus, all those contributions are tax deductible \u2013 potentially helping your cash flow situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SEP is first and foremost a retirement strategy but it\u2019s also a great fit for freelancers concerned about cash on hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Use a line of credit as your safety net<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every freelancer needs a safety net. But if you don\u2019t have enough savings to tide you over when cash flow is tight, consider applying for a business line of credit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">line of credit<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a useful tool that can help freelancers overcome cash flow gaps without the complications that come with a more traditional bank loan. You can borrow a pre-agreed amount of money from a financial institution when you need it and repay back when you don\u2019t. For example, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fundbox<\/strong><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> you can apply online<\/strong> and get a decision in minutes. If approved, you can draw on funds anytime you need them and have them transferred to your account as soon as the next business day. Plus, if you pay back early you save and there\u2019s no impact to your credit score just for applying.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also don\u2019t have to use the money right away you can simply have the line of credit on hand as a safety net for when unexpected cash flow issues arise. Unlike a business loan you can also use the funds for any purpose \u2013 paying bills, marketing, and so on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Always have an eye on cash flow<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re busy, you wear many hats, clients are asking for more and more \u2013 but remember cash is king. Don\u2019t wait until the tough times arrive to start worrying about cash flow. With careful planning you can offset the common cash flow pitfalls of being a freelancer and be more comfortable and successful for it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
