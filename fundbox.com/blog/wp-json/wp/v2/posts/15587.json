Last summer, during a global pandemic, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/newsletters\/axios-capital-07b1c7b4-99d3-43b9-9759-a0c54919bdc2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a record number<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Americans applied for new Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) or tax ID numbers, according to Axios.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pace of startups has slowed some since then, there is still a lot of activity around startup businesses making 2021 an excellent time to start a business. And if you need some help regarding how to start your own business and which businesses you should start in 2021, you\u2019ve come to the right place.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Small Business Ideas<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully, you have a list of small business ideas that appeal to you. The idea is to identify those ideas that can become profitable small businesses. Often, startup entrepreneurs are advised to follow their passion. While that might work in some cases, the truth is just because you are passionate about something doesn\u2019t mean consumers will care. The most successful businesses are the ones that offer products or services that consumers (whether B2B or B2C) want at a price they\u2019re willing to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what do consumers want today? Here are a few small business ideas that may be worth pursuing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>B2C Small Business Ideas<\/h2>\n<h3><b>E-commerce<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NRF (National Retail Federation) forecasts overall 2021 retail sales to grow between 10.5% to 13.5 %, to between $4.44 trillion-$4.56 trillion.

Many of these sales took place online, boasting an amazing revenue growth of 75% growth from 2019 to 2020. NPD recommends brick-and-mortar retailers continue to offer BOPIS (buy online, pickup in-store) or curbside pickup options since they provide convenience to busy parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fashion dolls and accessories (+56%), sports toys, including skates, skateboards, and scooters (+31%), games (+29%), building sets (+26%), and summer seasonal toys (+24%) were top sellers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>New online customers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/startup.unitelvoice.com\/ecommerce-website-builders\">open an online store<\/a>, your target market of customers has significantly grown.

Virtual kitchens are stripped-down commercial cooking spaces with no dine-in option. Functioning as hubs for online delivery and catering orders, they circumvent the need for costly buildouts in premium locations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less prime real estate also means more space to accommodate delivery and catering vehicles that would otherwise jockey with customers for parking space.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Tutoring<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tutors are in great demand today, and starting a tutoring service is a great side business idea. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ziprecruiter.com\/Salaries\/Private-Tutor-Salary-per-Hour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ZipRecruiter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reports private tutors are averaging sales of nearly $45,000 a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>B2B Small Business Ideas<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All those new startups are going to need help launching and growing their businesses.
