But the latest information shows they\u2019re not as \u201cdifficult\u201d as first reported.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, according to the newest <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adeccousa.com\/about\/press\/Pages\/2015-college-student-survey-stability-vs-dream-job.aspx?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=socialmedia&amp;utm_campaign=2015wtw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Way to Work<\/a> survey from Adecco Staffing\u00a0USA, 70 percent of Millennials surveyed would rather have a stable and secure job\u2014and aren\u2019t expecting to be emotionally attached to what they do.<\/p>\n<p>The survey also shows Millennials aren\u2019t into job-hopping\u00a0but do want to be given opportunities for advancement and promotion. Dan Schawbel, founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/millennialbranding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Millennial Branding<\/a>, says the top reason Millennials leave their jobs is \u201clack of career opportunity.\u201d If given the opportunity to advance, he says, Millennial workers would stick around for at least five years.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials appreciate additional job training, don\u2019t mind being mentored and would like help assessing their career goals within your company. Why not set up on internal mentoring\/coaching program where Millennials and older gen workers can help one another? Mentors can show Millennials the ropes, while Millennials can get the older workers up to speed on technology, showing them, for instance how to use social media, post a blog or edit an online video.<\/p>\n<p>As for doing \u201cwork that matters,\u201d only 19 percent of those surveyed say this is the most important factor when choosing a job. Even more interesting, factors like friendly work environments and flexible hours ranked near the bottom of their priority lists.<\/p>\n<p>While many think Millennials are glued to their smartphones, scanning their social media accounts all day, and not interacting with other employees, studies have shown they\u2019re actually more collaborative in the workplace than any other generation. A 2013 survey from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cornerstoneondemand.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cornerstone<\/a> revealed 60 percent of Millennials prefer in-person collaboration vs. 34 percent who would rather collaborate online. Take advantage of this by allowing them to team up and work on group projects. Work of this nature also encourages in-office participation, so you don\u2019t have to struggle with work-at-home requests.<\/p>\n<p>This also means inviting them to brainstorming meetings, asking for their input in general and making them feel like a valued member of your team.<\/p>\n<p>Their smartphone obsession also means they don\u2019t resent getting weekend,\u00a0or after-hours emails\u2014as long as they\u2019re not expected to drop everything and respond immediately.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking Millennials wouldn\u2019t want to work for a small business like yours, think again. Schwabel says Millennials actually prefer the flexibility of working for a small business and particularly chafe at workplaces \u201cwith strict corporate guidelines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some of the conventional wisdom about Millennial employees is true, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. They do want regular feedback, whether formal or informal, which is certainly helpful to business owners who can give guidance that\u2019s welcomed and not resented. This also helps you keep your vision and mission on track.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials and the next generation (some call it Gen Z) are the future of the workforce. They are very entrepreneurially-minded\u00a0but are willing to apply that mindset to their lives as employees, before tackling business ownership. So it\u2019s up to you to take advantage of this bright, open and hard-working generation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lot has been said about Millennials in the workplace these past few years, most of it negative: \u201cThey\u2019re entitled, &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":1968,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[326],"yst_prominent_words":[723,4799,866,5242,4885,5243,807,5245,1535,1772,5246,712,804,794,5244,5247,3090,5241,1528,1522],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Best Tips for Managing Millennials","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"There is no doubt Millennials have different expectations than older generations of workers from their jobs and their employers.
