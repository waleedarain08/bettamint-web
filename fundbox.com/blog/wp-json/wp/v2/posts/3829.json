You\u2019re increasing revenues, bringing in more clients, generating more sales, and constantly looking for new ways to grow.<\/p>\n<p>After all the effort you put into bringing sales in the door\u2014are you working equally hard to make sure the money you\u2019ve made is put to good use?<\/p>\n<p>No matter how profitable your business may be on paper, if the amount of cash coming in doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s going out of your business, you can\u2019t survive in the long term.<\/p>\n<p>Here are seven areas where your business may be losing money fast, along with seven ways to plug the leaks before they can destroy your future profitability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1) Accounts Receivable<\/strong><br \/>\nBefore we can even talk about the many areas where your business may be bleeding money\u2014let\u2019s take on the biggest financial hemorrhage of all: accounts receivable. Are your clients paying their invoices on time? Is the money coming into your business reflecting the work that you do?<\/p>\n<p>If your clients don\u2019t know for sure they\u2019ll hear from you the moment a payment is late, you\u2019re at high risk to be taken advantage of by customers, and you\u2019ll fail to get paid on time.<\/p>\n<p>Set clear policies with your customers for penalties and consequences when payments are late, such as a 5% late penalty after five days and work stoppage after 30 days past due.<\/p>\n<p>Internally, create a timeline for when you\u2019ll send the initial invoice, when payment reminders will go out, and when you\u2019ll make collections phone calls or when you\u2019ll cut off services if past invoices aren\u2019t paid. Auto-schedule each of these events through a software tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundinggates.com\/\">Funding Gates<\/a>, or just set a weekly appointment on your calendar to review your receivables and send out any needed invoices or reminders.<\/p>\n<p>In order to stop your business from bleeding money, you first have to make sure the money is coming in the door. Clean up your receivables and deal with clients who have long outstanding invoices before you address any other item on this list.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Fines, Fees, and Interest<\/strong><br \/>\nDo you know what your debt is costing your business? Whether from interest on business credit cards, loans and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-loans\/lines-of-credit\">lines of credit<\/a>, or even late payment fees on vendor invoices\u2014it\u2019s incredible how much being in the red can put you, well, even further in the red.<\/p>\n<p>Take the time to do a careful audit of all your costs of current debt, and look for ways to get those debts paid and off your plate. If you have a high interest <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fundera.com\/resources\/small-business-loans\">small business loan<\/a>, or even a few, research ways to refinance or consolidate those debts into a lower interest option.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a business credit card, make sure that you are paying it off every month to avoid paying interest, or consider using a debit or check card instead to avoid interest and fees. The difference of avoiding a few percentage points of interest may seem minor, but you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly it adds up to big savings for your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) Petty Cash<\/strong><br \/>\nIndividually, those five, ten, and twenty dollar purchases seem like no big deal. An office supply here there, some extra print services or packages mailed, even taking a client or two out for a casual lunch. But if you&#8217;re not paying attention, those small expenses add up quickly to become a significant drain on your budget.<\/p>\n<p>Take back control of your petty cash expenses by creating clear processes for managing receipts and tracking purchases. Then, set a monthly appointment to review purchases made, and evaluate whether that\u2019s really how you want to be spending your hard earned revenue. You may be surprised when you see how quickly the dollars add up, and having those figures in black and white is a great motivation to make changes and improve your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) Office Space<\/strong><br \/>\nYour swanky corner office with a view of the downtown skyline is nice and all, but do you know how that valuable real estate is affecting your profit margins?<\/p>\n<p>As more and more business endeavors go online, the cost of pricey office space is making less and less sense for many business owners. Not only could you be saving overhead on renting space, but studies show that your <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/01\/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home\">employees may actually be happier and more productive<\/a> if allowed to work from home. And with the growing proliferation of internal communication tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\">Slack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sococo.com\/\">Sococo<\/a>, and HipChat, you may hardly notice a difference in not having your team members just a few feet away.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Unproductive Time<\/strong><br \/>\nEvery minute you spend doing work that the customer is not willing to pay for is another cost against your bottom line. That means time you spend checking invoices, paying bills, tallying timecards or processing payroll? Yep, those are all dollars falling right out of your pocket.<\/p>\n<p>If you review your calendar or think about an average week in your life as a business owner, that is probably <em>a lot <\/em>of time. Obviously, these are all tasks that need to get done, but could there be a more productive way to complete these managerial tasks?<\/p>\n<p>With some research, you\u2019ll find there are many tools available that can drastically reduce your time spent on menial management tasks. Save time processing paper timecards with an employee time tracking tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tsheets.com\/\">TSheets<\/a>, expedite payroll and benefits processing with <a href=\"https:\/\/gusto.com\/\">Gusto<\/a>, or avoid the back and forth of scheduling employees\u2019 shifts with <a href=\"http:\/\/wheniwork.com\/\">WhenIWork<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Each of these tools does involve some upfront cost, but in many cases that cost is far lower than the value of your precious time spent doing extra work by hand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6) Marketing Spend<\/strong><br \/>\nOf all the line items on your balance sheet, marketing spend may be the area with the highest likelihood of scope creep\u2014or the subtle addition of unexpected costs adding up over time. Particularly in the age of content marketing, that addition of costs will often come from drains on employees\u2019 time, as hours spent maintaining social media profiles, updating the company blog, or creating marketing materials can escalate faster than one might expect.<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re not closely monitoring the return on your marketing dollars spent, you may be spinning your wheels on marketing efforts that do little or nothing to improve your revenue\u2014meaning you\u2019re bleeding cash in both directions.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re handling marketing internally or working with an outside agency, create clear parameters with your team for how you spend your marketing dollars, and what kind of return you expect. Stay focused on your website analytics and other metrics to determine what\u2019s working, and cut costs that don\u2019t show an impact on your revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, not every marketing effort will result in an immediate return. Some efforts take time to pay off, and that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not worth pursuing. But if you can\u2019t see some evidence of a positive result, or your team can\u2019t offer a data-based reasoning for pursuing a particular strategy, it may be time to reevaluate and reign in your cash.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7) Sloppy Accounting<\/strong><br \/>\nIn reality, there are an endless number of ways your business could be losing money\u2014even if just a few dollars at a time\u2014but you\u2019ll never know exactly where those costs are coming from unless you stay on top of your accounting.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not already, start making use of a simple accounting tool like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">Freshbooks<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\">Quickbooks<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.waveapps.com\/\">Wave<\/a>. Be sure you\u2019re tracking the money coming into your business as well as what\u2019s going out, and regularly keep your balance sheets and profit and loss statements up to date.<\/p>\n<p>The less you know about where your money is going, the more likely it is that you\u2019re wasting it, and fast. If you hope to maintain a successful business well into the future, it\u2019s essential that you keep a firm eye on your bottom line\u2014and all the other lines along the way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Day after day, you wake up, get dressed, go to work, and put in long hours of hard work to &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":4087,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11532],"yst_prominent_words":[1683,723,1721,3202,6059,3836,1797,785,3499,808,6060,6061,841,6058,4740,6062,3846,3300,4828,3090],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"7 Places Your Business is Bleeding Money\u2014and How to Fix it | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Day after day, you wake up, get dressed, go to work, and put in long hours of hard work to build your business.
