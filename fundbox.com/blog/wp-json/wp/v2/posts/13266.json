You need financial aid for your business\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business\u2019s revenue has declined due to closures or decreased customer demand, the PPP loan could help you save money <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> protect your employees. Not only can you potentially keep all your employees on payroll\u2014or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/retail-business-covid-survival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">replace your compensation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you\u2019re a sole proprietor\u2014you\u2019ll also get help covering your mortgage, rent, utilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an uncertain time, but having funding can help you weather the slower periods and keep your team intact as the economy gradually begins to reopen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your business is still open and operating to some capacity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have been forced to close during the past couple of months, but some businesses are still open, even if they\u2019re working at a reduced capacity. If your business is essential or if you\u2019re still operating to some degree, you may be in a better position to remain open and slowly build up your revenue until it\u2019s back to normal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, the PPP loan could give you the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/retail-business-covid-survival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> flexibility necessary to continue serving customers. Putting the loan money toward payroll expenses, rent, and utilities gives you the freedom to allocate the revenue you do bring in to other essential costs like inventory and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/retail-business-covid-survival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. You have low overhead costs\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of the PPP\u2019s strict rules around use, the loan may not provide enough financial flexibility to businesses with high overhead costs. However, if your operation has low overhead costs\u2014because you\u2019re an independent contractor, for example, or your staff <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/retail-business-covid-survival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">works virtually<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 you may be more likely to benefit from the loan\u2019s forgiveness clause.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say, for instance, that you\u2019re a self-employed graphic designer whose regular costs include a website subscription and Wi-Fi; you may be able to allocate 100% of your PPP funding to your salary compensation and likely get the loan completely forgiven.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.

You\u2019ve already applied and haven\u2019t heard back<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you applied for the PPP loan through a bank but had no success, you may be allowed to apply with a different <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-ppp-lenders\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lender<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
