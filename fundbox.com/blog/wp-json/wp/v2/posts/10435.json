Call it \u201cpink-washing\u201d or \u201crainbow-washing,\u201d call it whatever you like. The point is, it\u2019s not good enough.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you truly celebrate diversity? And why does it matter? We talked to four business leaders about the value of diversity\u2014and also got their tips for creating a vibrant and inclusive workplace.<\/p>\n<h2>Why does diversity matter?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re reading this article, you probably already know diversity\u2019s important. But if you need the numbers behind the impact, consider McKinsey\u2019s report on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/organization\/our-insights\/why-diversity-matters\">why diversity matters<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Among its most salient points were these two figures:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When compared to national industry medians, companies with the most racial and ethnic diversity were 35% more likely to have higher returns\u2014and companies with the most gender diversity were 15% more likely.<\/li>\n<li>For every 10% increase in racial and ethnic diversity among senior executives, company earnings rise 0.8%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation, the evidence does suggest that companies who commit to diverse leadership are more successful.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMore diverse companies, we believe, are better able to win top talent and improve their customer orientation, employee satisfaction, and decision making, and all that leads to a virtuous cycle of increasing returns,\u201d states McKinsey.<\/p>\n<p>In agreement is Stefan Kollenberg, co-founder and chief marketing officer of Crescendo, which offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/getcrescendo.co\/workplace-inclusion-blog\/2018\/10\/9\/shared-diversity-inclusion-strategies-resources\">diversity and inclusion training<\/a> tool. He cited the McKinsey report and also offered additional insight in a recent conversation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat really allows diverse workforces to thrive is when they feel like they\u2019re accepted and appreciated at work,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis feeling empowers employees to share their different \u2014\u00a0and potentially conflicting \u2014\u00a0opinions, leading to better group problem solving, more innovative products and larger profits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Anuja Ketan is co-founder and chief technology officer of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newtonx.com\/\">NewtonX<\/a>. Her company, an\u00a0AI-powered expert knowledge platform, has embraced\u00a0diversity since its launch. She says pandering to diversity doesn\u2019t work,\u00a0and highlights <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4814714\/uber-diversity-sexism-kalanick-report\/\">Uber<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2017\/11\/20\/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem\">Tesla<\/a>\u00a0as cautionary tales.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you go through the motions of hiring without emphasizing diversity, you will end up reproducing the bias of your industry,\u201d she says. And once your company grows, she notes that could \u201cseverely impact your public perception\u201d \u2014\u00a0which, in turn, will affect your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/c62b07c7-2fc9-45e0-9511-9877a84c4de8_Stefan20Kollenberg20on20diversity.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Start with your team<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to diversity and inclusion, it all starts with your team. They are, after all, the foundation for everything you do.<\/p>\n<p>When Ketan founded NewtonX, she and her co-founders prioritized culture and tolerance. \u201cMy co-founders and I had seen so many tech companies become toxic because of an early hire who is inappropriate or biased in the workplace,\u201d she says. \u201cWe proactively recruited our first 10 hires and emphasized cultural awareness and respect as a crucial component of culture fit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While NewtonX never had specific quotas to fill, she says focusing on those core values allowed it to \u201cnaturally develop into a highly diverse, female-led company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Crescendo places a heavy emphasis on the wording and placement of its job listings. \u201cWe ensure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getcrescendo.co\/\">our job postings<\/a>\u00a0use inclusive language and focus on the skill requirements of the role, rather than on specific degrees or years of experience which are often unnecessary barriers for applying,\u201d says Kollenberg.<\/p>\n<p>The company also shares its opportunities with a wide range of communities. \u201cWe want to avoid the bias of only hiring from our immediate network,\u201d explains Kollenberg. \u201cAnd focus on meeting people where they are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andres Zapata, co-founder of integrated marketing agency <a href=\"https:\/\/idfive.com\/\">idfive<\/a>, has a more laid-back approach: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-ways-to-hire-the-right-people\/\">Hire the best people<\/a>. Period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you are open to it all, amazing things happen, especially because nothing is forced,&#8221; says Zapata. &#8220;It\u2019s just natural. We have women in leadership, several non-native leaders, including our top brass, and a wide range of cultural, ethnic and racial diversity amongst our ranks. And they are all seriously talented.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/24f9d2f3-5406-4c4e-ae2a-63e5cfc1e80a_Andres20Zapata20on20diversity.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Cultivate diverse leaders<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to have diverse leadership, Ketan says you must be conscious of who you\u2019re hiring for each position. She notes that, while many companies say they are \u201c50% women,\u201d their management is not.<\/p>\n<p>To combat this, NewtonX strived to hire women for leadership-track roles from the beginning, and then created a \u201ctransparent promotion path to manager.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, women hold more than half of NewtonX\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/hiring-your-leadership-team\/\">leadership positions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBe proactive and intentional about hiring women and minorities for leadership and tech-focused positions,\u201d says Ketan. \u201cCulture comes from the top down and it\u2019s important to live the values you espouse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/f8b277e0-92b2-4e34-ae3b-f757c75af277_Anuja20Ketan20on20diversity.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Involve everyone in the process<\/h2>\n<p>Employees are your most valuable asset. That\u2019s why Kollenberg says understanding what they want, and maintaining open lines of communication, is absolutely vital.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFeedback is incredibly important,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen getting started, mistakes will be made and you need to be willing to learn from your employees.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Melisa Yatman, Senior Human Resources Business Partner for <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/careers\/\">Fundbox<\/a>, agrees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Here at Fundbox,\u201d says Yatman, \u201cwe really value employee feedback. We\u2019re currently working on rolling out a Diversity and Inclusion Program at the company. We listen to and care about the people we work with, and employees clearly value inclusion so we\u2019ve made this a top priority.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To get a pulse on your team\u2019s needs, here\u2019s what Kollenberg recommends: \u201cStart asking questions about diversity and inclusion in your one-on-ones, have open forum discussions and create avenues for getting feedback. From there, you&#8217;ll identify which areas of your business need the most work and you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getcrescendo.co\/\">solutions to those problems<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While you may not yet have an official Diversity and Inclusion program yet, there are many ways to get buy-in and feedback from your team. Here are some unique initiatives that Zapata\u2019s firm idfive has introduced:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold cookoffs where team members share \u201cdishes inspired by their ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees to suggest where to volunteer for the company\u2019s annual \u201cDay of Giving.\u201d (This year, it was the International Refugee Committee \u2014\u00a0a pitch from an employee who\u2019s an Iraqi political refugee.)<\/li>\n<li>Donate all the profits from the company vending machine to a charity chosen by the team.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/760c1a33-cc08-46d9-8421-cc900622f9c4_Melisa20Yatman20on20diversity.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s OK to start small<\/h2>\n<p>To create a culture of diversity, your efforts don\u2019t have to be over-the-top or expensive. You just have to view business decisions through an inclusive lens.<\/p>\n<p>idfive, for example, offers floating holidays so team members can take paid leave on days that are important to their own religion and culture.<\/p>\n<p>At Crescendo, all employees list their pronouns in bios on Twitter, LinkedIn, email, etc., as part of the company\u2019s effort to normalize the behavior.<\/p>\n<p>And NewtonX has a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for racist or sexist comments\u2014even ones meant as jokes. \u201cWe believe making sure employees feel comfortable, respected and valued at the workplace is a crucial component of encouraging top-notch performance,\u201d says Ketan. The company also outlines every meeting\u2019s agenda beforehand, which allows \u201ccontent to prevail over personalities.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Be intentional<\/h2>\n<p>Are you seeing a common thread here? To integrate diversity into the fabric of your workplace, you don\u2019t need a magic wand or specialized knowledge. To be successful, you do need to be open, intentional, and proactive with your efforts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo go beyond tokenism, your company&#8217;s leadership needs to do two main things: take diversity and inclusion seriously and actively ask for feedback,\u201d says Kollenberg. \u201cWhen employees see leadership committing time and effort to improve their own behavior and making the processes within the company more inclusive, it sets a strong foundation for everything else.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yatman points out that being intentional about diversity can help set the company up for business success later on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s not very common for an early-stage company like Fundbox to focus on diversity initiatives, but we believe the right time to address them is early on,\u201d says Yatman. \u201cWe want to be ahead of the curve and align our culture and business with our core values while maintaining a diverse and inclusive environment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tg2b9nqbH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business\/\">6 Ways to Increase Employee Retention in Your Small Business<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;6 Ways to Increase Employee Retention in Your Small Business&#8221; &#8212; Fundbox\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business\/embed\/#?secret=tg2b9nqbH3\" data-secret=\"tg2b9nqbH3\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>4 experts explain how to go beyond lip service and create a truly inclusive workplace.
