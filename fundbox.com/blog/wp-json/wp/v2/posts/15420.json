So, why is your main competitor\u2019s page getting all the hits while <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> website struggles to make it to the top of page three on Google? Are they just lucky?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not at all. Search engine results have little to do with luck. Chances are, your competitor is using a variety of search engine optimization (SEO) tools, including content marketing, to drive web traffic to their page.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in getting those page one Google results for yourself, you need to do the same.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And you need to do it more effectively than your competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is Content Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait, content? But I\u2019m a (plumber, personal trainer, attorney, real estate agent, etc.), not a writer or marketing professional. True, but as a pro in your field, you have lots of information and expertise to share with would-be customers. And this, says Greg Gifford, vice president of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/searchlabdigital.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SearchLab, an SEO agency that specializes in helping small- and medium-sized businesses reach local customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is the key to getting your page to pop up when someone Googles \u2018plumber near me\u2019 (for example).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c(Businesses) have to have better content on their site to answer the questions potential customers might be asking about products or services, to outshine competitors and look better to Google,\u201d Gifford explains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This doesn\u2019t mean making your home page wordier, says Gifford\u2014it means adding content, in the form of a blog, to your website. The blog should contain \u201cpurely informational content\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rather promotional\/sales-oriented content<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so you can establish yourself as <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> local expert on the product or service you provide (the fact that you are a local business that wants to draw in local customers, as opposed to one with a wider geographical reach, doesn\u2019t change anything about the content marketing you engage in other than the fact that you\u2019ll need to use the same keywords local customers are using in searches). Even though the content isn\u2019t written with the intent to make an immediate sale, it is likely to increase sales in the long run because readers will a) remember that they read something useful on your blog and b) return in the future with money in their pockets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Type of Content Will Drive Traffic to My Website?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, the type of content you post will depend directly on the type of business you are running. A plumber, for example, might post articles about how to unclog a toilet or deal with frozen pipes. An interior designer\u2019s potential customers might like to read about how to select paint colors or how to remove wallpaper. For a coffee shop owner, articles that answer questions like \u201cwhat is a macchiato?\u201d or \u201ccan I make a latte with oat milk?\u201d are bound to get hits. Just think about some of your industry\u2019s most sought-after information, and go from there, says Gifford.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The clincher: The content must be well-written, with plenty of strong\/relevant keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWriting poorly-constructed content or content with grammatical and spelling errors is going to hurt you more than it will help you,\u201d Gifford says.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should I Hire a Professional to do My Content Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a good writer who also happens to have some basic SEO knowledge? Creating a content marketing plan and writing the content yourself is always a possibility (especially if your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to outsource). If you decide to go this route, Gifford suggests taking some training courses rather than just winging it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are a lot of free resources out there,\u201d he says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, bringing a professional onboard to help create a content marketing strategy is never a bad idea. For one thing, it frees you up to focus on other things (like actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the best at what you do in town, rather than writing about it). Plus, professional content marketing strategists already have all the necessary knowledge and tools at their disposal, so they can get a program implemented in a reasonable timeframe without all the roadblocks you might encounter trying to figure it out yourself for the first time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who do you hire to help? Options include full-service SEO agencies (like Gifford\u2019s), smaller agencies that specialize specifically in content marketing or independent\/freelance content marketing experts. All are great options, as long as the folks you are working with understand SEO and analytics along with content marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Using Social Media to Market Your Local Business<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of whether you decide to outsource your content marketing or DIY, posting content on a blog is really just the beginning of an effective content marketing strategy. You\u2019ll miss many opportunities to market your business locally if you fail to incorporate the use of social media into the plan (because social media is one of the most effective ways to let people know your content exists, says Gifford).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are few ways to use social media as a content marketing tool:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post\/share links to your content on your social media channels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engage with your audience on social media. If someone leaves a comment or asks a question, answer them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on the social media tools your target audience uses. TikTok sounds like fun, but is your target audience actually spending time on TikTok? If they aren\u2019t, that isn\u2019t a productive use of your time (at least not when it comes to advertising your local business).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, stick to channels that are well-suited to the type of business you run. A visually-oriented business, like a hair salon or a remodeling company, is a good candidate for Instagram. A plumbing service? Not so much.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t shy away from paid advertising, Gifford says, because \u201corganic social reach is very, very low.\u201d This means paying Facebook or Instagram, for example, to promote a post that links to your latest piece of content so that it gets in front of the audience you are trying to reach (otherwise, the link to the post you spent so much time on could fade away into Facebook oblivion).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Do I Have to Develop a Content Marketing Strategy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The downside to incorporating content marketing into your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-marketing-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Time and money, of course. And no, you don\u2019t <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do it. But it really is one of the best ways to make sure your business stands out in the crowd, says Gifford. Plus, content marketing is an advertising strategy that is growing exponentially (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/report\/content-marketing-market-industry-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one recent report indicated that the industry is expected to grow, as a whole, by more than $250 billion between now and 2024<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). Just be sure that your content marketing strategy is, well, strategic. Know your goals, know your audience, know your keywords and search terms\u2014all before you start creating content. Armed with that information, you\u2019ll be well on your way to creating a plan that will draw more traffic to your website and, ultimately, more customers through your front door.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have a professionally-designed website with the contact information for your local business prominently displayed on your home page.
