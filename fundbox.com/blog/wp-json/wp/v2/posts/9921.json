There are many reasons a lender may turn down your loan application, but there\u2019s one reason you may not expect: fraud.<\/p>\n<p>The good news? It\u2019s not impossible to find business financing, especially with a little bit of extra work and research. The bad news? It will be a little harder than it would be without the blemish on your record.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study done in 2014, a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.acfe.com\/rttn\/docs\/2014-report-to-nations.pdf\">whopping 66 percent<\/a><\/span>\u00a0of small businesses are victims each year and the typical affected organization loses about 5 percent of their annual revenue to fraud. And some business owners don\u2019t even discover it until they run their credit report. Business identity theft could happen to any size business, and since small businesses don\u2019t tend to have sophisticated security systems, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/business-identity-theft\">they\u2019re often even more vulnerable<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about fraud affecting your business financing application, here are a few tips.<\/p>\n<h2>First, do your best to avoid fraud in the first place<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, the easiest way to ensure fraud doesn\u2019t tank your loan application is to take steps to prevent it in the first place. While falling victim to business fraud can\u2019t be entirely avoided, there are a few things you can do to monitor your credit and protect yourself.<\/p>\n<h3>Monitor your credit<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not currently in the market for business financing, it\u2019s a good idea to set up credit monitoring services. Programs such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/\">Nav<\/a><\/span>\u00a0will actively monitor both your personal and business credit for new accounts or suspicious activity and send you an instant notification if anything looks amiss.<\/p>\n<h3>Be careful about the details you\u00a0share<\/h3>\n<p>Phishing, both through email and text, is one of the most common tricks used to score personal data from businesses. If you receive a text with an unfamiliar phone number or link\u2014especially one that asks you to update your information\u2014<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nickclements\/2017\/03\/30\/5-easy-steps-to-help-avoid-fraud-and-identity-theft\/#42bbe7a5112a\">don&#8217;t share any personal information. <\/a><\/span>The sender may be creating malware to gain access into your phone.<\/p>\n<h3>Skip the free public WiFi<\/h3>\n<p>It may be tempting to sign into that public WiFi, but most public networks don\u2019t offer much security on mobile apps, so it\u2019s much easier to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumer.ftc.gov\/articles\/0014-tips-using-public-wi-fi-networks#Mobile\">steal your private info this way<\/a><\/span>. If you do decide to use a public WiFi system, never do your online banking when connected\u2014wait until you\u2019re on a secure and private network.<\/p>\n<h2>How will fraud affect your business loan application?<\/h2>\n<p>Credit card issuers and credit reporting agencies are constantly monitoring your credit for suspicious activity. When something admiss shows up, credit agencies will issue a fraud alert to your credit report. This is Transunion, Experian, or Equifax telling lenders to be careful because the person applying for a new account might not be you.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud, you can also set up your own fraud alert. This is a way of telling the credit agencies and lenders to double check that the person applying for financing is actually you.<\/p>\n<h3>A slower process<\/h3>\n<p>When there is a fraud alert on your account, lenders are required to take extra steps to verify your loan application which can drastically slow <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/blogs\/ask-experian\/fraud-alert-may-slow-loan-approval-but-shouldnt-prevent-it\/\">down the approval process<\/a><\/span>. In some cases, a fraud alert could prevent you from prequalifying for certain loan products. Though a fraud alert usually won\u2019t bar you from getting loan approval overall, it\u2019ll definitely make the process longer and more drawn out.<\/p>\n<p>If you were the one to add a fraud alert to your account, you\u2019re probably already prepared for the slowdown. Though it\u2019s an extra step, it\u2019s worth it to avoid additional red marks on your credit report. But what happens when you intentionally apply for a loan\u2014only to have a lender deny it due to fraud concerns?<\/p>\n<h3>Remove a fraud alert<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you were the one to add the fraud alert or your (valid) application triggered an incorrect alert, you\u2019ll want to reach out to the credit agencies and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/blogs\/ask-experian\/removing-a-fraud-alert-from-your-credit-report\/\">ask them, in writing<\/a><\/span>, to remove it from your account. Of course, you want to be completely sure that nothing fishy is going on with your accounts, especially if you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud in the past.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Fraud is a real concern when it comes to business financing. Not only can undetected fraud sink your credit score and make it incredibly difficult to land a loan, but a fraud alert will also slow down the entire process. If you have a fraud alert on your account, it\u2019ll take a few extra steps and a bit more caution to land that loan\u2014but it\u2019s not impossible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Applying (and getting approved!) for business financing is difficult enough, but when you have a red mark on your credit &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":9923,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11547],"yst_prominent_words":[5221,9543,1700,723,1703,739,2936,2028,9548,989,6657,9541,9542,3030,2046,9545,9544,1126,9547,9546],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How a Fraud Alert Affects Your Application for Business Financing | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Applying (and getting approved!) for business financing is difficult enough, but when you have a red mark on your credit report, it\u2019s even more arduous.
