What\u2019s more, one in four people are seeking help from a financial advisor for the first time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many individuals want help assessing their investment portfolios and retirement funds, while many small businesses are seeking guidance on how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/use-job-costing-to-manage-expenses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, improve cash flow, or apply for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emergency funding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, many financial services businesses\u2014including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-accounting-firm-can-bring-value-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounting firms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, CFPs, and CFO consultants\u2014are seeing an influx of new clients this year. However, not every business will keep those clients.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To improve your services <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i> <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/professional-services-challenges\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce client turnover<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you may need to change your approach. Consider the following three strategies:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Streamline your workflow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streamlining your workflow can give you more time to dedicate to your clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTake inventory of your processes and see if you can delegate or automate anything,\u201d said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.christinasjahli.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christina Sjahli Consulting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sjahli recommended using a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/why-every-business-needs-cash-flow-forecasting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow forecasting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> software, which can help save time and eliminate manual calculation errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also delegates tedious tasks. \u201cI look for repetition. If I delegate repeatable tasks to the bookkeepers, I can focus on analyzing and communicating the story behind the business\u2019s financial numbers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have a team to delegate to, consider outsourcing. \u201cHire the marketing company instead of learning to create a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d said Tremaine Wills, an investment advisor and the owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindovermoney.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mind Over Money<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWhenever possible, save yourself time by doing what you do best, and pay everyone else to do the rest.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Improve your communication<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to increase client satisfaction is to become a proficient, empathetic communicator. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCommunication will make or break your business,\u201d Wills said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, 54% of financial professionals surveyed in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.im.natixis.com\/au\/research\/2020-financial-professionals-survey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 Natixis Global Survey of Financial Professionals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said frequent client communication is a top factor for success. When asked why their past clients left, 60% of survey respondents said it was because they failed to listen to their clients\u2019 needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every client will have different needs and preferences, so it\u2019s a good idea to ask how often they want to hear from you, Wills said, whether it\u2019s on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sjahli likes doing a weekly update with her business clients. She goes over critical points of discussion throughout the week; checks in on milestone progress; discusses next steps and goals; and asks her clients what type of support they need for the coming week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every call, email, or Zoom meeting with your clients, aim to listen intently, ask follow-up questions, and speak in a helpful, compassionate tone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try taking on the role of a teacher, Wills said; that means over-explaining tricky topics and operating on the assumption that your clients don\u2019t know everything. Especially right now, \u201cOur clients need reassurance that their plans make sense and that we\u2019ll guide them through these trying times,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Offer services and solutions that address your clients\u2019 fears\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your services starts with figuring out what your clients need. Before you dive into their taxes or create a plan for their investments, take the time to sit down and discuss your clients\u2019 goals and fears.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sjahli said many of her business clients are trying to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">close their cash flow gaps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/coronavirus-business-pivoting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shift money<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to their most profitable services or products right now. Others, however, are worried about raising capital or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-growth-on-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">planning for growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during a recession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for her clients, Wills said, \u201cMany millennials are struggling with building wealth due to being crippled by student loan debt. And my clients who are parents fear their children may face the same financial obstacles they faced in their early adult years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you understand your clients\u2019 greatest concerns, you can work on creating a plan or solution that helps address and mitigate their fears. Depending on your business services and clientele, that might mean presenting your client with different investment options every month, introducing them to business bookkeeping software, or generating personalized <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-free-small-business-budget-templates\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weekly budget plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another tool to help prepare your clients for difficulty is to do scenario analyses, Sjahli said. That way, \u201cClients can be proactive instead of reactive when an unexpected event happens.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go above and beyond<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going the extra mile for your clients can result in lower client turnover and stronger <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/search\/referral\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">referrals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Consider what you can offer your clients beyond personalized services. Maybe you can provide on-demand help and guidance, for example, weekly one-on-one check-ins, or free access to budgeting or forecasting software.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need financial help to hire extra hands or invest in new <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technology<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, consider applying for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finance experts are in high demand this year. 49% of adults in the U.S. said the pandemic made them realize &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":83,"featured_media":13910,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232,11504,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[723,2540,713,1248,773,968,978,3037,2456,3403,1097,5244,3300,3492],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-right-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"3 Ways Your Financial Business Can Improve Client Retention | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Finance experts are in high demand this year.
