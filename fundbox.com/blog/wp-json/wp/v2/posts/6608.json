But not everyone looks forward to the process and time it takes to get approved for a traditional business loan\u2014and that\u2019s assuming you can get approved in the first place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For small business owners who seek timely financing to invest in their business and cover their operating expenses, invoice financing may be a much more sensible funding option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the difference between invoice financing and invoice factoring?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The terms \u201cinvoice financing\u201d and \u201cinvoice factoring\u201d are often used synonymously, though they\u2019re not the same thing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep reading to learn about the differences between invoice factoring and invoice financing to see which one makes the most sense for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is invoice factoring?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice factoring typically requires small businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to a third party at a hefty discount. Believe it or not, factoring companies have been known to take as much as 40 percent of the value of an invoice as their fee. More commonly, however, factors charge 10 to 15 percent on each invoice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, a factoring company will give you a slice of your unpaid invoice up front. Then they\u2019ll repay the remainder of the invoice, minus their fee, when they collect payment from your customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a key consideration here. When you decide to move forward with invoice factoring, your customers end up paying the factoring company, not your business. This can be slightly embarrassing to say the least. Making matters worse, this also opens the door to the possibility that your customer will have a negative experience dealing with the factor you decide to join forces with, which could hurt your chances at doing business with the customer again in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s more, some factoring companies might decide <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to buy your unpaid invoices if your clients have bad reputations or suboptimal credit scores. In order to move forward with invoice factoring, you need to be able to prove that your clients are good for their money and are generating consistent revenue on a regular basis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth pointing out that invoice factoring companies are known to charge any number of additional fees\u2014including origination and account setup fees, lockbox or service fees, incremental fees, unused line fees, monthly minimum volume fees, renewal fees, overdue or collection fees, credit check fees, non-recourse factoring fees, ACH transaction fees, and wire fees, among a myriad of other fees. These fees may not be disclosed clearly upfront and may require some digging to understand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add it all up, and it\u2019s safe to say that you need to research your options and read the fine print before moving forward with invoice factoring.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does invoice financing work for a company?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commonly mistaken as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-invoice-factoring\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, invoice financing allows you to borrow against your uncollected receivables. Instead of letting unpaid invoices collect dust and hinder your business, you can use an invoice financing service to advance payments on outstanding invoices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, it operates like an on-demand business cash advance against unpaid invoices. When you advance cash for unpaid invoices, you usually repay the advance, plus a small fee, within a certain time period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With invoice financing, small businesses can get a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revolving credit line<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against unpaid invoices without affecting their relationships with their clients. Rather than selling unpaid invoices to a factoring company and incurring the associated discount\u2014and dealing with all the potential associated problems\u2014invoice financing enables you to retain control over all of your invoices, only borrowing against the ones you choose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being the case, invoice financing allows small business owners to reclaim control of their cash flow. Instead of scrambling to put together money to pay bills each month, they get the peace of mind that comes with knowing funds are only just a click of the mouse or tap of the finger away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to helping small business owners pay regular operating expenses, invoice financing services can also give companies enough padding to develop new products; launch new marketing initiatives; buy new equipment and technology; open additional locations; and remodel their storefronts, restaurants, and offices, among other things.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Invoice factoring and invoice financing at a glance<\/b><\/h2>\n<div class=\"custom-wp-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Invoice Financing<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Invoice Factoring<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Unpaid Invoices as Your Credit Line<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>Yes<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>No<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advance up to 100% of your unpaid invoices value<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>Yes<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>No<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use it as you need it<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Yes<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>No<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sell your invoices to a third party<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>No<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>Yes<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provider may contact your clients directly to collect unpaid invoices<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>No<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>Yes<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<style>\n.custom-wp-table table {\n  height: 349px;\n  width: 915px;\n}\n.custom-wp-table td:first-child {\n  min-width: 240px;\n}\n@media (max-width: 1200px) {\n  .custom-wp-table table {\n    width: 100%\n  }\n  .custom-wp-table {\n    overflow-x: auto;\n    max-width: 100%;\n  }\n}\n<\/style>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is invoice financing a good idea?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it really boils down to it, it\u2019s impossible to say whether invoice financing is a good idea for your business or not.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every company\u2019s financial circumstances are unique, and different financing options will make more sense than others based on specific situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, invoice financing tends to be a more affordable option than invoice factoring. It also gives you more control over your company\u2019s image, since you can give your customers more time to pay instead of having to ask for payment immediately. And you\u2019ll also end up collecting money directly from them whenever they settle their accounts instead of having a third party ask for money on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the invoice financing solution you choose, you should also be able to get paid much sooner than you would by using a factoring service. Due to a longer application process and the due diligence the factoring company needs to do, it tends to take a week or more to receive funds through factoring. On the flip side, you may be able to get paid within two or three days using invoice financing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much does invoice financing cost?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any other financial instrument, invoice financing fees vary. Generally speaking, however, this is one of the more affordable forms of small business financing because you\u2019re borrowing against what you\u2019re already owed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you settle on invoice factoring or invoice financing, it\u2019s worth exploring your other options.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you may be able to overcome cash gaps simply by changing the way you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/when-should-you-send-your-invoices\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice your customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you\u2019re waiting until the end of the month to send your clients a bill, consider testing out whether it makes sense to invoice them once work is complete. This could accelerate payment timelines considerably.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatives to invoice financing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in securing fast, flexible financing quickly, you may also want to consider applying for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
