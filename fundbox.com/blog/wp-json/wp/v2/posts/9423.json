What makes Facebook ads even more powerful is how they compliment your other marketing efforts.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2013\/03\/28\/tech\/mobile\/survey-phones-facebook\/index.html\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2013\/03\/28\/tech\/mobile\/survey-phones-facebook\/index.html\">People check Facebook an average of 14 times a day!<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Retargeting PPC, website, and other traffic on the platform can work extremely well. There are also a multitude of different ways to target past customers by uploading their emails, phone numbers, and letting Facebook match that data to existing users.\u00a0I could write a whole separate article about the robust targeting options with audiences, but the easy wins are retargeting campaigns and utilizing your current customer data through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>An example campaign that we ran for an Austin orthodontist generated leads for $4. She was generating leads through Google Adwords for $50+.<\/p>\n<p>In this campaign, we targeted the demographic that converted best on their website with a lead generation campaign. In this case, that demographic was Spanish-speaking women, ages 35+ with children.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/8b63caa2-d418-4bd4-b36d-ae14baf31a1a_pasted20image200.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For a mobile home manufacturer, we also ran a lead generation campaign that was able to generate $1 Million dollars with just over $2000.\u00a0That\u2019s a return of over 18,000%.<\/p>\n<p>These are just a couple of examples. It\u2019s extremely common to find that FB is your best marketing channel once you figure out the right messaging to the right audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook Ad Action Items<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up your Facebook pixel (to allow for retargeting)<\/li>\n<li>Upload past customer data to create a past customer audience<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Pay Per Click<\/h2>\n<p>Pay per click, or \u201cPPC\u201d, is an auction-based system for strategically showing ads to users who are conducting internet searches. Every click will cost you a set amount depending on the competitiveness of the keyword being targeting.<\/p>\n<p>For example, someone in San Antonio may do a search for &#8216;solar company san antonio&#8217;, click on an ad costing the advertiser $5, then land on the solar company&#8217;s page. The key to pay per click is getting one of these clicks to &#8216;convert&#8217; or take action through a phone call or contact form submission.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/ppc\/seo-vs-ppc-infographic\/\">\u00a0PPC visitors are 50% more likely to purchase something than organic visitors.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The key with PPC is to get the lowest CPA (cost per acquisition) possible. This is accomplished by optimizing your campaign frequently to ensure you have great ads driving quality traffic to a high performing landing page. You can learn more about PPC by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hj-k9wzExMA\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hj-k9wzExMA\">watching this video.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Below is an example ad and landing page we use for an actual client. The ad and the landing page have a conversion rate of 20%+ which is very high for this type of advertising.\u00a0You\u2019ll notice that the ad mentions that they\u2019ve been in business since 1982 which is a huge trust builder. The landing page also mentions that the business gives first time customers $20 OFF.<\/p>\n<p>Offers like this work great with PPC. Test different messaging\/landing page combinations until you find the one that converts the best. Here\u2019s the text we used in the ad:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bryantelectricservice.com\/?keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D\">Texas Electrician<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bryantelectricservice.com\/?keyword=%7Bkeyword%7D\">Serving Austin Since 1982.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>bryantelectricservice.com\/austin\/electrician<\/p>\n<p>Award Winning Texas Electricians.

Try thinking of a compelling offer you can give visitors so you can capture their email. That email can be utilized to retarget them on any of the platforms mentioned here in additional to being emailed directly. This greatly increases the chance of converting them into an actual customer.<\/p>\n<p>We also mentioned automating emails and sending one off campaigns in our first tip. Pop ups are an effective way to build up an email list of potential customers. In the example pop up below, one of our clients utilizes it to collect client information from people that are about to \u2018abandon\u2019 their website. These types of pop ups are referred to as \u2018exit-intent pop-ups\u2019, which only appear when someone is about to leave the website. They are a great way to capture people that are about to leave your website without giving you their information. They came to your site because they were interested in your product or service! It\u2019s important to make every attempt to capture their email and follow up to close the sale.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b2978f31-199c-4cf0-b48f-e98c2e327e66_pasted20image200.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Action Items<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a popup with a compelling offer<\/li>\n<li>Test Ideas<\/li>\n<li>Privy is a FREE pop-up creation tool<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Wrapping it up<\/h2>\n<p>So now that you heard our top marketing tips, how do they all work together? How can you look at things holistically to get the best results?\u00a0These channels can all be creatively tweaked to strengthen one another.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you see that specific messaging is working through your PPC ads, try using that same messaging throughout your emails, Facebook ads, and website to see if your conversion rate increases. Emails collected through popups can be used as retargeting audiences in AdWords or Facebook. There is plenty of room to get creative!<\/p>\n<h2>Missed part 1?
