Also called microcredit, microlending has been gaining popularity over the last five years\u2014and for good reason.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is microlending<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microlending is the practice of giving small loans\u2014from $25 to a few hundred dollars\u2014to business owners in need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microlending falls under the umbrella of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microfinance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which refers to any financial help given to people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise benefit from traditional financial institutions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microloans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> began as a way to help business owners and entrepreneurs who either 1) have no access to funding where they live or 2) can\u2019t get funding from banks because of their lower <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-mistakes-hurting-your-personal-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit scores<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the internet and the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending economy\u2014where individuals give each other loans\u2014microlending has become a global phenomenon. Loaning small amounts of money goes especially far in developing nations and impoverished places where aspiring entrepreneurs have little government assistance to start businesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does microlending work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microloans work like most other term loans: borrowers get a certain amount of cash upfront that they have to pay back\u2014with interest\u2014over a specific period of time. Unfortunately, interest rates on microloans tend to be high, with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/04\/14\/world\/14microfinance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average global interest rate hovering around 35%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That\u2019s because it\u2019s riskier to lend to entrepreneurs with poor credit; plus, borrowers often don\u2019t put up collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike a bank loan, microloans can come with unique stipulations for the borrower. For instance, many microlenders require borrowers to take an educational workshop or business class before they can receive their funding.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the majority of traditional financial institutions don\u2019t see the payoff in microlending, most microlending occurs on P2P platforms. However, there are also a handful of dedicated microfinance institutions (MFIs), such as 51Give in Beijing and Grameen Bank and BRAC of Bangladesh.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain countries have also developed their own microloan programs. In the United States, the Small Business Administration (SBA) has a microloan program designed to help women, low-income, veteran, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/minority-entrepreneur-funding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minority entrepreneurs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get access to working capital, supplies, or equipment. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fas.org\/sgp\/crs\/misc\/R41057.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average SBA microloan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is around $14,000 and has a 6.5% interest rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the benefits of microlending?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microlending can help entrepreneurs from marginalized communities or impoverished areas get their businesses off the ground, which in turn gives struggling individuals and families the chance to earn a better income. In the long term, microlending can help create job opportunities, reduce poverty, and further education.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a microloan lender, there\u2019s a small financial incentive in the form of interest, but there\u2019s also a chance that a borrower could default on the loan. For that reason, most lenders spread out their investments to minimize their risk. Instead of contributing $1,000 to one single borrower, for example, a microlender might loan $100 to 10 different borrowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that most microlenders don\u2019t dabble in microfinance for the potential ROI. Rather, the main benefit of microlending is helping a worthy business owner <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-biggest-mistakes-avoid-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launch or develop their company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What to know as a borrower: risks and benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need a small amount of money for your business and have had a hard time getting help from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-banks-for-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traditional financial institutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, microlending could be right for you. Its primary appeal is accessibility and ease. If you have a promising business plan and a compelling story, getting a microloan via an MFI or P2P website may be easier than turning to a bank.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are risks to taking a microloan. Funding isn\u2019t always fast. Depending on your location or your lender\u2019s requirements, you could wait weeks or months before getting your money. Plus, if your business doesn\u2019t take off, you could be stuck paying high interest rates that trap you in a debt spiral.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you make a choice, consider the following factors:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your location and access to funding<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your credit score<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much money you need<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-growth-on-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">profit potential<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to become a microlender<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few ways to get started.
