If you run a business partnership, it&#8217;s a great time to step back and reassess your relationship, business processes, and introduce efficiencies into your business. Here are six tips for doing just that.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Revisit Your Business Partnership Profit Share Agreement<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it, business dynamics change. If your partnership has evolved over the past year or is likely to change in the coming year, it&#8217;s important that you revisit your partnership or profit-sharing agreement to reflect these subtleties. If you need to change your agreement drastically, consider bringing the services of your lawyer or accountant to make sure everything is correctly documented.

Expectations between partners can change. Are your goals still in alignment? Do you both still want the same things from your business? Are your measurements of success still the same? Do you need to change your tactics to achieve your goals?<\/p>\n<p>Springtime is also a period for planning ahead, so check in with you partner on these important considerations.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Evaluate One Another&#8217;s Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This one isn&#8217;t as awkward as it sounds. If you&#8217;re to have a healthy business partnership, communication is key and confrontation shouldn&#8217;t be feared. Just as in a marriage, it shows that you are both invested in the business. If you can&#8217;t give your partner honest feedback, how can you make the partnership work?<\/p>\n<p>To make this process easier, set and agree to goals for yourselves and the business each year or every six months. Then spend some time together reviewing progress and performance against those goals. Incorporate a self-assessment into the process\u2014this will make it easier for each partner to analyze their own performance. If either of you feels that improvement is needed, try to be honest and discuss your options for making this happen. Remember, the goal here is to emphasize the opportunity that improvement can bring, not to dwell on the negative.
