Even the female business owners who had no employees had total revenues of more than $229 billion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of owning a business as a woman<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many reasons a woman can benefit from owning a business. Perhaps most importantly, it gets you away from the glass ceiling that still limits how much money women in business can earn and how high they can rise at many corporations in the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting certified as a woman business owner<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many women, entrepreneurship is the means to a limitless future. So how can you take advantage of that? One way is to get certified. If you\u2019re a female business owner, getting your business certified offers several benefits, including increasing your company\u2019s visibility, gaining access to opportunities you might not otherwise have, and securing the chance to win corporate or government contracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of certification as a woman-owned business:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women\u2019s Business Enterprise (WBE): This designation is used by private sector organizations and many state and local governments seeking women-owned companies to conduct business with.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB): This designation is used by federal government agencies looking for women-owned companies to do business with. The Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) is a subcategory of WOSBs for those that meet the criteria for being economically disadvantaged.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decades ago, the federal government set a goal of awarding at least 25 percent of federal contracts for small businesses and five percent for female business owners. Women business owners can, of course, compete for any type of federal government contracts. But some contract opportunities are only available to female business owners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to compete for federal contracts, check out the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/federal-contracting\/contracting-assistance-programs\/women-owned-small-business-federal-contracting-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0WOSB (Women-Owned Small Businesses) federal contracting program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As noted above, certain women entrepreneurs may also be eligible to be certified as Economically Disadvantaged WOSBs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The certification process for WOSBs and EDWOSBs has recently changed, making it \u201ceasier for qualified small businesses to participate\u201d in the program by improving the customer experience, according to the SBA.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out about the free certification process by going to this SBA <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.certify.sba.gov\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-06\/SBA_WOSB_Table_508_v8.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about your options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or get <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-03\/SBA-WOSB-FAQ-2021-508.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">answers to FAQs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Getting certified as a WBE can give your small business an advantage against bigger businesses when trying to land these contracts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As recently as late 2020, businesses were able to self-certify; however, you can no longer do so.
