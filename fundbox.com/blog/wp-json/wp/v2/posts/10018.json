The panel discussed strategies on ways to recognize and tackle unconscious biases internally and externally and provide solutions to create a more inclusive environment.<\/p>\n<p>The second panel that Rymarz participated in took place on October 23 and was called <a href=\"https:\/\/money2020us2018.sched.com\/event\/FHcc\/untapped-opportunities-in-small-business-financing-where-is-the-data-leading-us?iframe=no\">Untapped SMB Opportunities: Where is the Data Leading Us?<\/a>\u201d This panel revealed\u00a0new research that identifies the most untapped opportunities in small business financing. Indeed, methods for lending to SMBs have remained virtually unchanged since the 1950s.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional measurements of assessing personal credit scores, debt utilization and collateral may have worked well in the past, but there are still countless numbers of small businesses not considered creditworthy by traditional underwriting methods. Our experts explore how big data and more flexible underwriting models can provide a clearer picture of financial health (or risk) and help lenders close the gap for the most neglected SMBs.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/ed1facff-6562-49ff-a070-0c88784a9d57_201820Builders2020Innovators20Summit.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Fundbox CEO Eyal Shinar Honored by Goldman Sachs<\/h2>\n<p>Also for the second year in a row, our CEO Eyal Shinar has been named among the 100 \u201cMost Intriguing Entrepreneurs\u201d at 2018 Builders + Innovators Summit, according to Goldman Sachs.<\/p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs selected Shinar as one of 100 entrepreneurs from multiple industries to be honored at the three-day event.
