It&#8217;s no secret that the holiday season is the busiest time of the year for many consumer-facing businesses, especially when it comes to maintaining holiday inventory. According to the National Retail Federation, retailers can expect as much as <a href=\"https:\/\/nrf.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30% of their annual sales<\/a> to come during this time of year as holiday retail sales have been steadily growing over the last several years. Similarly, as <em>USA Today <\/em>points out, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/2015\/12\/17\/holiday-season-restaurant-spending-on-the-rise\/76777038\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant sales have been trending upward<\/a> during the holiday season too.<\/p>\n<p>In order to capitalize on shopper and diner tendencies to reach deeper into their wallets at the end of the year, retailers and restaurateurs alike naturally need to have enough inventory, supplies, and ingredients on hand to meet customer demand. The last thing a storeowner wants is to run out of a hot item when a ton of other customers want to buy it. Restaurant owners can&#8217;t expect to boost revenues if they keep running out of the special that&#8217;s been the buzz of the town or don&#8217;t have a fully stocked bar.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, maximizing revenue during the holidays requires having more products and supplies on hand\u2014more than what&#8217;s carried during the slower months.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Challenge of Holiday Inventory<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, even if they want to, many small business owners simply don&#8217;t have the luxury of stocking up on inventory ahead of the holidays. That&#8217;s because they need to focus on covering costs associated with holiday parties, paying out end-of-the-year bonuses, and perhaps adding a little seasonal flair to their storefronts and dining rooms\u2014all the while having to stay on top of recurring operating expenses.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where Invoice Financing Comes In<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you find yourself in a similar situation\u2014without enough cash on hand to splurge on excess inventory\u2014you&#8217;re not completely out of luck. Instead of waiting to sell inventory to customers before being able to restock your supplies, you can use an invoice financing service like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\">Fundbox<\/a> to stockpile more inventory ahead of time. As a result, you will be able to meet customer demand without having to worry about turning anyone away\u2014and thereby missing out on additional holiday revenue. As an added bonus, because you won&#8217;t have to spend as much time meticulously planning the volume of inventory you need and can afford each week, you&#8217;ll be able to spend more time on customer service and marketing endeavors.<\/p>\n<p>While a hefty receivables account on your financial statements might look nice, you need cash to buy inventory.
