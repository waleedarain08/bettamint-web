While some roles require dedicated personnel\u2014such as start-up&#8217;s need for a handful of full-time developers in-house\u2014other responsibilities are often better suited for contractors, agencies, and freelancers. This article explains the outsourcing process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about outsourcing some of the tasks your team is dealing with on a regular basis, take comfort in the fact you\u2019re not alone. In fact, one <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunly.com\/statistics\/outsourcing-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that 54 percent of businesses work with third-party entities to achieve their objectives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do companies choose to outsource work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it boils down to it, small businesses usually decide to outsource work for two reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, they might simply not have enough room in the budget to hire a full-time employee, guaranteeing their salary, covering their benefits, and taking care of payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, as every entrepreneur knows too well, there are never enough hours in the day. So, as operations start to scale, small business owners often decide to outsource certain tasks they\u2019ve taken care of since the beginning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, an entrepreneur might decide to hire a payroll company for small businesses instead of taking care of accounting functions every quarter. As a result, there\u2019s more time to spend on everything else.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the benefits of outsourcing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a reason more and more small business owners are working with contractors, freelancers, and third-party agencies: The benefits of outsourcing\u2014which we\u2019ll briefly explore next\u2014are numerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. More time to focus on the bigger picture<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As all business owners know too well, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/serenitygibbons\/2020\/07\/16\/why-entrepreneurs-should-prioritize-time-management-within-their-businesses\/?sh=2a036de29a8f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time is a limiting factor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might have been easy enough to write a couple blog posts, send out invoices, and handle other administrative responsibilities in the past, there comes a point when small business owners need to step away from these tasks and learn the power of delegation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By outsourcing work, small business owners are able to reclaim time each week they can then invest in other more important areas of operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Hire experts to do specific tasks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you\u2019re not taking care of something on your own any more doesn\u2019t mean quality will suffer. In fact, the opposite is often true.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To continue the above example, most small business owners aren\u2019t experts in copywriting, accounting, and people ops. They\u2019re experts in their business\u2019 core functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By outsourcing the right tasks to better-qualified parties, small business owners are usually able to ensure the resulting outcomes are more impactful than if they took care of the same things themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Get the job done cost-effectively<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no way around it: Hiring employees is expensive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only are businesses responsible for payroll taxes and benefits, they also have to devote resources to sourcing and interviewing candidates. Once an employee is hired, the work is just beginning. Companies usually have to invest a lot of resources into <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/professional-services-challenges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hiring and training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other hidden costs to consider, too. For example, depending on how many employees you have, you might have to hire additional workers (e.g., managers and an HR professional). There are also costs associated with equipment, utilities, office space, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, outsourcing certain tasks lets you bypass this altogether. You end up getting to leverage someone else\u2019s expertise without having to break the bank or absorb tons of indirect costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Invest in other areas of growth<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re spending less money on payroll while outsourcing, there\u2019s more budget to devote elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you run a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">landscaping company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you might decide to sponsor a local Little League team with your savings. If you run a restaurant, you might decide to put your savings from outsourcing toward <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/start-food-truck-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buying a food truck<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or opening another location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, you could always decide to put any excess funds aside and save them for a rainy day. As far too many small business owners learned the hard way in 2020, an emergency fund is more than just a nice to have.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Improve business continuity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of 2020, all business owners know how rapidly things can change. Everything can be going swimmingly one day, and then all of a sudden, an unforeseen event can rear its ugly head, derailing operations overnight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By joining forces with third parties, entrepreneurs can mitigate some of this risk while improving business continuity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, imagine a business headquartered in Colorado loses power during a massive blizzard. The business has partnered with a marketing agency in New York City and a freelance accountant in Austin, Texas. Even though their own doors may be closed, the marketing agency and accounting professional can keep plugging away, making sure work doesn\u2019t grind to a halt entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, you have a solid understanding about the benefits of outsourcing. That said, just because outsourcing can help you grow your business doesn\u2019t mean you should outsource <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">task. Up next, we\u2019ll explore some of the more common tasks small business owners try to route to other professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should small businesses outsource?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While every small business is unique, there are still a number of threads that tie them all together. In most cases, here are some of the responsibilities that small business owners outsource most often:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Marketing. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of writing blogs or designing ebooks by yourself, consider enlisting the services of freelancers who can take care of these tasks for you. The right partners will be able to produce high-quality content reliably, freeing you to focus on other needs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Web design. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still using a template-based, do-it-yourself website builder, it\u2019s probably time to give your site a makeover. Enlist a talented agency to take care of this for you. That way, you\u2019ll end up with an incredible digital property on the other side\u2014and you won\u2019t have to waste countless hours making tweak after tweak.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Accounting. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There comes a time when every owner of a growing business needs to step away from processing invoices, paying bills and taxes, and making sure employees are paid on time. In the digital age when a solution only is a quick search away, one of the easiest tasks to outsource is accounting.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>HR. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are you don\u2019t have time to make sure every new hire has signed each form, enrolled in health insurance, and has gotten up to speed with every policy and procedure. Luckily, human resources for small business services are popping up every day. Again, a quick search will find the answers you\u2019re looking for.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have an idea of the kinds of tasks your small business can outsource, let\u2019s turn our attention to some of the things you should keep in mind before deciding to hire consultants, freelancers, and third-party agencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should you consider before outsourcing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While outsourcing can be incredibly helpful to many small businesses, you can\u2019t just decide to outsource any old task and expect great results. Here are some of the questions to ask yourself as you whittle down your options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Is this mission-critical or is this something I should delegate?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If something is absolutely critical to your operations, by all means keep that responsibility on your own plate. The last thing you want to do is to outsource a really important task to someone only to find out the hard way they made a costly mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Is this the right move for the long term?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the right approach, outsourcing can help you grow your business. That said, it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t sacrifice long-term potential for short-term gains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you have a dedicated employee who\u2019s looking to develop more skills, it may make more sense, in certain scenarios, to train that individual to level up instead of contracting a third-party\u2019s services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, in an age where more and more workers expect jobs to be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/236438\/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professional development opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this could have a massive impact on employee retention and productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Can I afford to pay freelancers and contractors?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about outsourcing work and enlisting the services of freelancers, contractors, and third-party agencies, that\u2019s awesome.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You just need to make sure you have the cash needed to pay them for their services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s face it: Every small business owner worries about cash flow\u2014at least from time to time. While working with third parties can be the more cost-effective option in many cases, you still need to be able to settle up invoices if you want your outsourcing initiatives to succeed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ideal world, you\u2019ll always have cash on hand to pay contractors on time each and every time. But in the real world, you might run into a scenario where money\u2019s tight and you need to turn to an outside source of financing to settle your bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to worry: By securing a flexible <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the funds you need to pay your near-term debts are always at your fingertips.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What tasks are you going to outsource?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No entrepreneur can do it all by themselves. Truth be told, there comes a time in every small business owner\u2019s life when outsourcing tasks is a necessity for taking the company to the next level.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re reading these words, you\u2019re on the precipice of witnessing the upside of outsourcing first hand. Form a plan, start small, take things piece by piece, and you\u2019ll do just fine.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even the hardest-working entrepreneur can\u2019t do everything on their own.\u00a0At some point, every small business owner needs to hire a &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":15371,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,326],"yst_prominent_words":[723,719,8463,1510,712,1004,709,3101,3300],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"top-left-risks","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"What Tasks Should a Small Business Outsource? | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Small business owners may need to hire a team if they want their companies to get to the next level.
