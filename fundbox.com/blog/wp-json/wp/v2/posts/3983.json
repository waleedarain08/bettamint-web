While\u00a0they may leave you for various reasons, it\u2019s less common for a vendor to dump a client, so many may take it personally.<\/p>\n<p>There are several valid causes to re-evaluate your client list on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019ve recently raised your rates and a client is unwilling (or unable) to meet the increase, that client might make the cut list.<\/p>\n<p>Does the client demand too much of your time for too little reward? Again, they may be a candidate.<\/p>\n<p>Has your business grown away from the services you provide a certain client? You get the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips on how to cut these clients with tact.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Give Two Weeks Notice<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Just like a job, it\u2019s classier to give someone standard notice instead of dropping the mic and walking out. Two weeks is a good standard, though the amount of notice you give should depend on the norms of your industry and the size and scope of work you&#8217;ve been doing for that client.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what industry you&#8217;re in, you are more likely to get a good reference and end the relationship on a positive note if you give your client ample time to make alternative plans.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Give a Reason<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just disappear. Whether you are up front with the client about money or behavior issues, or just cite \u201ccreative differences,\u201d provide a solid reason why you are ending the relationship. Otherwise, the client will craft their own narrative as to why the relationship went sour, and their version always seems to assume the worst.<\/p>\n<p>Also, try to make sure your excuse doesn\u2019t have you pointing fingers at your client, putting them on the defensive.<\/p>\n<p>If there is still an open door (ie. an increase in pay), let them know. If you want to dismiss the relationship entirely, give an ironclad excuse that\u2019s hard for them to refute like, \u201cI can no longer accommodate your needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Avoid Lying<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This may go without saying, but it&#8217;s important.<\/p>\n<p>Most industries operate in small circles, and you never know for sure who knows who&#8230;or who might talk in the future. While it might be tempting to tell a client &#8220;it&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me&#8221; when ending your working relationship, don&#8217;t give reasons that aren&#8217;t true where you could be caught in that untruth.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can\u2019t tell your client you\u2019re leaving the business, moving, or changing direction if you aren\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Finish What You Started<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While it may be tempting to drop burdensome projects, complete the work you have to do for a client before you terminate your affiliation. Pending the project, the client may release you of your responsibility, but go in with a plan on how to wrap up loose ends.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Keep Apologies to a Minimum<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While you might apologize for the inconvenience, don\u2019t go overboard with excuses. In fact, don&#8217;t feel the need to give any excuses at all.<\/p>\n<p>Apologies could make you appear less professional, make the client feel worse about being &#8220;dumped,&#8221; or even give your client the ability to guilt you into continuing the relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As an adult and a professional, you have every right to decide which working relationships make sense for you. There&#8217;s no reason to apologize for exercising that right, for setting boundaries, or for changing your mind.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Send References<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you want to earn a positive client reference, consider giving your client a list of vendors or other businesses that can fill the void you will leave when you stop working together.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few ways to do this. You can tap your network and keep track of who is looking for work. You can also refer an up-and-coming company that would appreciate the new business as much as you did when you took on the client.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that your references reflect on you, too. If you can\u00a0 provide your ex-client with a fantastic reference who can jump in and pick up where you left off, your client will remember you more kindly.<\/p>\n<p>Leave a little wiggle room to engage with the client in the future. You never know when your paths may cross again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>This article was updated January 2019.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Breaking up is hard to do, especially when it\u2019s with a client.
