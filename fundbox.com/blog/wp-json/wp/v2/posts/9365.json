But now, your company is, well, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a company<\/span>. Is it time for a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-credit-cards\">business credit card<\/a><\/span>? Chances are that whether you\u2019re in startup stage, or a full-blown functional business, you need a business credit card in your wallet.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s why that personal credit card might not cut it any longer\u2014and exactly how to tell.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why Choose a Business Credit Card Over a Personal Card?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a totally reasonable question. After all, business credit cards function just like a personal credit card. The issuer gives you a credit limit; you can make purchases, balance transfers, and even cash withdrawals. And, if you pay back the amount you\u2019ve borrowed, your limit replenishes. Plus, you can get benefits and rewards from both, like cash back, miles, and points.<\/p>\n<p>The key differences, though, between <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/business-vs-personal-credit-cards\">personal vs. business credit cards<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are significant enough that they could change the way your business spends.\u00a0These are four of the major benefits that might lead you to choose a business credit card:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">They\u2019re <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">designed for businesses<\/span>. That means rewards and other perks are geared toward benefiting companies. For instance, a business credit card might\u00a0offer extra cash back on office-supply expenses.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">limits are <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">often<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0higher<\/span>. That could be great news for you\u2014especially because companies\u00a0generally spend more than individuals. It\u2019s very possible that the limit on your personal card will be too low to meet an emergency business\u00a0expense\u00a0or stay at a good credit utilization ratio\u00a0(usually considered 30% or below).<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You can use them to<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">build<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0business credit<\/span>. You have a business credit score\u2014and that\u2019s different than your personal credit score. You can build your business credit at the big three <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/resource\/understanding-three-major-business-credit-bureaus\">business credit bureaus<\/a><\/span>\u2014Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax\u2014with a business credit card. And, probably unsurprisingly, a better business credit score will lead to better\u00a0business loan\u00a0options, too.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">They help you protect your personal liability. <\/span>It\u2019s important to draw a distinct line between your personal and business finances (aka spending for business on a business credit card). This is especially true from a liability standpoint. If you can\u2019t pay your credit card bills, or, worse, your business is sued or you need to declare bankruptcy, your expenses must be separated so that your personal assets and credit are protected.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9369\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/shutterstock_623351963.jpg\" alt=\"How to know you're ready for a business credit card\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/shutterstock_623351963.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/shutterstock_623351963-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How to Know If You\u2019re Ready for a Business Credit Card<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">why<\/span>\u00a0you should get a business credit card, here\u2019s how to tell\u00a0that you\u2019re\u00a0ready to get one. Any one of these reasons on its own is reason enough\u2014and if you see yourself in more than one, then it\u2019s definitely time to find the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-credit-cards\">best business credit card<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for you:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. You have good personal credit.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already proven that you\u2019re responsible with your personal finances and borrowing, chances are you\u2019ll also\u00a0be able to responsibly use a business credit card.\u00a0When you\u2019re applying for your first business credit card, card issuers will check your personal credit score in order to figure out which\u00a0business cards you\u2019ll qualify for. If you\u2019re still building or rebuilding credit, you do still have some business credit card options; or, you can also consider working on your personal credit with a secured personal credit card before applying for a business card.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. You need to build toward a loan&#8230;<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a startup or new company that doesn\u2019t have enough time in business to qualify for a business loan, but do need some capital to get things rolling, a business credit card can really help. If used strategically, 0% introductory APR business credit cards can work like interest-free loans for their intro periods, giving you time to pay back large purchases. Plus, you\u2019ll be building good business credit while you pay back your bills in full on time thereafter.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. &#8230;or graduate into a better one.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you didn\u2019t get favorable business loan terms because of your credit score and you\u2019d like to refinance your existing loan, or graduate into a better product, a business credit card can help. By paying off your bills in full and on time\u2014on top of being diligent with your loan payments, of course\u2014you can prove financial responsibility to your lender.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. You want to track or control employee or contractor spending.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Most business credit cards give you the option to issue employee cards connected to the main cardholder account. But many also allow you to set spending limits on these employee cards\u2014some even will let you restrict spending to only certain categories of products, dates and times, or remotely turn cards on and off. You don\u2019t have to be paranoid about anyone running up thousands of dollars of debt of unapproved expenses on your card.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. You haven\u2019t separated your business and personal finances yet.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Not only does keeping your transactions separated make accounting and tax time easier, but it\u2019s a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">must <\/span>if you want all of the liability protection of that LLC or corporation you filed for. It\u2019s as simple as setting up a business bank account and making sure you\u2019re spending on a designated business credit card\u2014otherwise, how does anyone know where your life stops and the business begins?<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. You spend a lot but don\u2019t earn anything for it.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Running a business costs money. Whatever you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">have <\/span>to be spending on\u2014supplies, inventory, utilities, gas, professional services\u2014you might as well be earning rewards for, right? And since you can pick the rewards that benefit your business most, like hotel stays or statement credits, there\u2019s no reason why you should be spending and not earning at the same time.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. You don\u2019t have a good handle on your business spending.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Tracking expenses is difficult enough\u2014and if you\u2019re not great with money, adding a credit card into the mix could be dangerous, sure. But a business credit card can help you figure out what kind of categories your business is spending on, how often, and during what seasons. If you pay with cash, you don\u2019t have that kind of papertrail. By spotting patterns, you might be able to score bulk discounts longer-term contracts with vendors, or get a card that\u2019ll reward you for certain spending categories, like entertaining or utilities.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">If It\u2019s Time, Make Sure to Find the Best Credit Card for Your Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of reasons your business might be ready for a business credit card\u2014and, luckily, many types of business credit cards to suit these needs.
