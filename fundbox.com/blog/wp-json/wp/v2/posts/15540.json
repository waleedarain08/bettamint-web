The halfway point in a calendar or fiscal year is a great opportunity to reevaluate the goals you set at the start of the year, analyze your progress, and make adjustments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefit of setting business goals\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regularly setting goals and measuring your progress is key to consistently improving your business. Not only does thoughtful goal-setting force you to plan ahead, it also gives you a way to track your work and results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the most of your goals, though, you need to revisit them often. Evaluating your goals halfway through the year is particularly valuable because it gives you time to course-correct and set yourself up for success. A mid-year check-in and reset makes it easier to:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay focused and on task with your goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improve <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boost morale for the second half of the year<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eliminate strategies or projects that aren\u2019t working<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spot potential problems in your operations, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-financial-resolutions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finances<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or marketing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure you\u2019re using your time and energy wisely\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to evaluate your goals halfway through the year<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to get started? Here are four steps you can take to review and reset your business goals for Q3 and Q4.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Organize and review your goals\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by revisiting the goals you set at the end of last year and the start of Q1 and Q2. To get a clearer picture of your progress, try organizing them by category and timeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Categories could include revenue, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/know-your-customers-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer acquisition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, marketing, operations, sales, or growth, for example. Within each category, group your goals by annual, quarterly, or monthly benchmarks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Assess your progress<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One by one, go through your goals and evaluate your progress according to the specific milestones you set. If you already have a system for tracking your progress, this step will be pretty straightforward. If you don\u2019t, now is the time to implement one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For each goal, work on answering the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you define progress? Which specific key performance indicators (KPIs) are you tracking?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you exceed the goal, meet it, or fall short? To what degree?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the goal is still in progress, are you on track to reach it?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What strategies have you used to reach your goals in the first half of the year? Which tactics have been helpful?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you faced any obstacles so far? If so, what are they?\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the goal is still in progress, do you think it\u2019s realistic to reach?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there any unique circumstances that have affected or will affect your ability to reach the goal?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Answering these questions in detail will give you a good idea of whether or not you\u2019re on track to meet your goals\u2014and if you\u2019re not, what you need to change going forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say you set a goal to improve your gross revenue by 10% from the same months in the previous year. If you\u2019ve fallen short of your goal each month and there were no exceptional circumstances that disrupted your progress, you need to review the marketing and sales strategies you\u2019ve been using. Maybe you need to rework your sales funnel, for example, or allocate your resources to a different <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> distribution channel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s also a possibility that the goal itself isn\u2019t realistic given your customer base and budget, which means you may have to change it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Adjust your goals with new information<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve measured your progress, think about which changes (if any) you need to implement for the second half of the year to either meet or exceed your goals. Here are some factors that can contribute to your successes or struggles:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seasonality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes to your team<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changes to your customer or client base<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow fluctuation\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unforeseen events or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-disaster-prep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crises<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Countless circumstantial changes can affect your goal progress. If your customer base has grown significantly over the past quarter, your cash flow might be tied up in inventory. If your project manager recently quit, you may not have enough resources or time to take on new clients for a while. If your busy season is coming up, you may have more revenue than usual.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it\u2019s also important to think about your business from a holistic standpoint. Maybe you\u2019ve hit your sales targets every month, for instance, but you know from a recent employee survey that your sales team is feeling overwhelmed and burnt out. In that case, continuing with the same benchmarks for the rest of the year could jeopardize the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/employee-appreciation-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">satisfaction and wellbeing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why it\u2019s helpful to ask the following questions when adjusting your goals:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this still an important goal to strive for?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is it realistic?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this goal in line with our company values?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do we have the resources and time necessary to pursue this goal?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your answers, you can either scrap the goal, amend it, or leave it as is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Create monthly and weekly plans for carrying out your goals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The surest way to reach your goals is to create a reasonable plan for executing them. Breaking your goal down into smaller pieces makes it feel more achievable. For each goal, consider the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tasks: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you need to do each month, week, and day to make progress on your goal?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>People: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who will be in charge of executing each task?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Resources:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What resources do you need to achieve your goal?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Results: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does success look like for this goal?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine that one of your goals is to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-hiring-challenges-and-solutions-for-small-business-owners\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an administrative assistant by the end of Q3. Using the format above, you might include the following information:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tasks:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Write a job description for the role by the end of week one, post the job description to several different job boards and recruiting sites by the end of week two, review all the applications that come in by the end of week five, schedule interviews by the end of week seven, etc.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>People: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business owner and HR admin to write the job description together, HR to post the job online, HR to screen all applications then send the top five to business owner, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Resources: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subscriptions to job search engines and recruiting sites; market standard salary information; training guide for new hires, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Results: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking the new administrative assistant through the onboarding process by week 12.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a spreadsheet to list out your various task details and timelines, or try a project management tool.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting SMART goals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re running a business, it\u2019s tempting to set lofty goals, but dreaming big only gets you so far. You\u2019ll have more success meeting your business goals if they follow the SMART format, meaning they\u2019re specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, instead of saying you want to acquire more customers by the end of the year, you could say you want to grow your customer base by 5% each month until you reach 5,000 customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Embracing the mid-point check-in<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Figuring out what works in your business takes trial and error, but the more often you set and revisit your goals, the more success you\u2019re likely to have.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, instead of moving fast without looking back, take the time to check in, honestly evaluate your efforts, and pivot if you need to.
