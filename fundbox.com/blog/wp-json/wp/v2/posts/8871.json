Perhaps you already have one?<\/p>\n<p>Wherever you are on your financing journey, it\u2019s important to understand the tax implications of borrowing against a line of credit. For example, while a line of credit isn\u2019t recognized as income for tax purposes (since the money you borrow is paid back), there are several tax write-offs and considerations to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>In this part in our <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2018 Small Business Guide to Lines of Credit<\/span>, we\u2019ll answer your biggest questions about taxes and business lines of credit, particularly in light of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017\">2017 <\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act<\/a><\/span>. Of course, every business is different, so not all of these questions will apply to everyone. When in doubt, we recommend you consult your tax professional or accountant.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Can I deduct line of credit repayments on my taxes?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>No. Any funds drawn against a business line of credit aren\u2019t considered a cost to your business and are not eligible for a deduction.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What about the interest on a business line of credit?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can deduct interest payments made on funds you borrow. To do this, you must prove that the deduction is both an \u201c<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ordinary and necessary<\/span>\u201d business expense. According to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/deducting-business-expenses\">IRS<\/a><\/span>: \u201c<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade or business. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business. An expense does not have to be indispensable to be considered necessary<\/span>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Using a line of credit to purchase equipment or inventory, for example, would all fall into the category of an ordinary and necessary business expense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tip:<\/span>\u00a0We recommend keeping an itemized list of any assets you purchase with your line of credit. That way, you can maximize your deductions through the year, and you\u2019ll have a paper trail in the event of an IRS audit.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do depreciation deductions work and how might a line of credit affect these?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you use your line of credit to purchase new equipment for your business, you may be able to take the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/a-brief-overview-of-depreciation\">bonus depreciation deduction<\/a><\/span>\u00a0on the equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Most types of tangible property (except, land and inventory), such as buildings, machinery, vehicles, furniture, and equipment are depreciable.\u00a0To be eligible, the asset must have a useful life of more than one year. The depreciation is then written off over the useful life of that asset. You can start depreciating once the asset is in use and stop once the cost is fully recovered or you no longer use it in your business. The bonus depreciation deduction is claimed as a business expense on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f4562.pdf\">Form 4562<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Talk to your tax advisor about claiming this deduction. With the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecpadesk.com\/tax-and-accounting-desk\/tcjabonusdepreciation\/\">bonus depreciation percentage<\/a><\/span>\u00a0has expanded from 50% to 100% and the assets that qualify for the deduction have also changed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tip<\/span>: Keep a record of when you put any equipment or other assets into service so that you can accurately claim any bonus depreciation.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How can I maximize my tax position?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The best way to ensure you\u2019re maximizing your deductions is to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/dont-mix-business-personal-finances\/\">keep your personal and business finances separate<\/a><\/span>. Maintain a separate bank account for any funds you borrow against your line of credit and use that account exclusively to make purchases or relay funds towards business expenses. Not only will this make recordkeeping easier, it will also help cover you if the IRS has any questions.<\/p>\n<p>Another best practice is never to use your line of credit for personal expenses. This could result in the IRS reclassifying your line of credit as personal, and refute your ability to claim any business expense deductions associated with it.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How should I stay on top of recent changes to the tax law?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Unless you are a tax expert yourself, the best way is to consult with a trusted tax advisor. Although the tax preparation deduction has been eliminated by the TCJA, it\u2019s important to get expert advice. We\u2019ve mentioned a few changes here, but there may be more that apply to your specific situation.<\/p>\n<p>During tax season, and year round, your tax advisor can help ensure you\u2019re up to date on changes to tax law, keep you in compliance, and help you get the deductions you deserve.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8776\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Guide-to-LOC-banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We hope you found the Fundbox <strong>2018 Guide to Business Lines of Credit<\/strong> helpful!<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to check out the other parts in the series:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part 1: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work\/\">What Is a Business Line of Credit and How Does It Work?<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Part 2: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-business-line-credit-can-help-grow-business\/\">6 Ways a Business Line of Credit Can Help Grow Your Business<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Part 3: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-choose-a-line-of-credit-for-your-business\/\">How to Choose a Line of Credit For Your Business<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><small><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Disclaimer: The information in this blog doesn\u2019t replace the advice of a tax or legal expert.
