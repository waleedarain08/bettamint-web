Not only is it almost impossible to get a hold of the person who cuts your check, but they often have a business policy, as the Wall Street Journal reports, to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052702303296604577450561434496668\" target=\"_blank\">pay small vendors late in order to conserve cash<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another problem for small businesses, is that they tend to think that a sale is complete once the invoice is issued, but, actually, collections is the last step. Until the money is in your bank account, that sale never happened!<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are seven things that small business owners can do to handle a slow-paying client with diplomacy and grace!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Invoice ASAP <\/strong><br \/>\nDon\u2019t wait until the end of the month, invoice your clients as soon as the work is complete. If it\u2019s a large project, arrange monthly billing or even milestone billing so that you can invoice at certain stages of completion. Don\u2019t send snail mail invoices and make your payment terms clear \u2013 \u201c<em>Due upon receipt<\/em>\u201d is way too ambiguous!

Some require a purchase order, others require approval from the person whom you do business with, and most invoices cross several desks before they land on the desk of the accounts payable clerk. If you understand how each client handles the process, you\u2019ll gain a better idea of where potential delays may occur. Use this intel to inform your invoicing and collections process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Re-send a copy of the invoice as the due date approaches<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you haven\u2019t received payment and it\u2019s getting close to the due date, it\u2019s okay to send a reminder invoice. This is a useful prompt because it gives the client the opportunity to reassure you that it\u2019s on the way, or expedite it if it\u2019s slipped through the cracks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Push for electronic billing and payment<\/strong><br \/>\nFind out if you can move beyond paper invoicing. Are PDF invoices acceptable? Does your client have an online payment process like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bill.com\/\">Bill.com<\/a> (in my experience payments have been turned around in 5 days from the receipt of the invoice)? Accounting software like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\">FreshBooks<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xero.com\">Xero<\/a> can also substantially reduce the time it takes to get paid \u2013 send invoices electronically, track whether clients have viewed them, and send automated late payment reminders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be a friendly, yet firm collector<\/strong><br \/>\nIf a client is serially late in paying you, place a call to the person with whom you do business. Explain that you are escalating as a last resort and wanted them to be aware that your payments are repeatedly past due. If the client has any merit at all (or just wants to avoid embarrassment), they\u2019ll try and get some answers. With a bit of luck they\u2019ll also connect you with the accounts payable contact so you have that POC for future issues. Ask them when the payment will be made (a definite date), make a note of it and be prepared to contact them again if payment still doesn\u2019t arrive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When it gets bad<\/strong><br \/>\nIf a client refuses to pay for whatever reason or has gone out of business, you may just want to cut your losses and right it off as bad debt on your taxes. Send them a formal letter stating that they are in breach of contract and that you\u2019re suspending work. If you do intend to start legal proceedings, let them know. But don\u2019t use it simply as a threat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>An ounce of prevention<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the best things you can do to avoid getting into a non-payment situation is to use your contract to your advantage.
