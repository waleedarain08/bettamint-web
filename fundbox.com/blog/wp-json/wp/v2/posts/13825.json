Many institutional investors are reluctant to put money into companies that don\u2019t have at least some history of revenue or growth.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, you have options. One of the most common ways early-stage companies raise money is with convertible notes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a convertible note?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A convertible note is a type of investment that lets founders raise money from investors without having to conduct a formal company valuation first. Unlike a priced round, which is an equity investment based on a valuation, a convertible note is a short-term debt that has the potential to convert into company equity at a later date.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though valuations can give you a better idea of your company\u2019s worth and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> potential, they also force you to put a price on your stock. That\u2019s why many founders like the idea of convertible notes; you have more time to see how your company will evolve before setting a price per share.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does a convertible note work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an investor believes in your company, they can give you a loan in exchange for a note in the form of convertible debt. The note then turns into shares of preferred stock upon a qualifying event or transaction, like the closing of a Series A round of financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convertible notes are designed to reward early investors for their risk, which is why they typically come with a valuation cap or conversion discount.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A valuation cap sets a maximum valuation at which an investor\u2019s money can convert into equity. This cap\u2014which determines the company\u2019s price per share\u2014holds true for convertible noteholders even if later-stage investors pay a different price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conversion discount, on the other hand, gives investors a discount on the price per share when their note converts into equity. That means they can purchase shares of preferred stock at a lower price than investors who come in during later rounds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a convertible note includes a valuation cap <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a conversion discount, the noteholder typically gets to choose whichever advantage gives them the lowest price per share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because a convertible note is a form of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-pay-off-your-business-debt\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">debt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it also comes with terms that help protect the investor, including a fixed interest rate and maturity (or expiration) date. Convertible notes typically accrue interest at a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundersclub.com\/learn\/convertible-notes\/convertible-notes-overview\/interest-rate-convertible-note\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rate of 2-8%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, depending on your location.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a convertible note hasn\u2019t already converted to equity by the time the note expires, you have to pay back your investor\u2019s principal investment plus interest. Of course, you can always opt to extend the maturity date, but you have to get your investor\u2019s permission to amend the note.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SAFE vs. convertible note<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people look into SAFEs as an alternative to convertible notes. SAFEs and notes are similar in that they both convert to equity, but the process is different.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SAFE stands for Simple Agreement for Future Equity. SAFEs convert into shares of stock in a future priced round. Unlike convertible notes, which don\u2019t convert into equity unless the company raises a specific amount of capital, SAFEs usually convert into equity during the next priced round regardless of how much money your company raises.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another difference is that SAFEs aren\u2019t a form of debt; they\u2019re considered a warrant instead. Because of that, SAFEs have no maturity dates or interest rates, which can be better for founders. However, they do usually have a valuation cap or conversion discount investors can take advantage of.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both convertible notes and SAFEs are good options for founders who want to get funds quickly. However, convertible notes tend to have more protections for investors, which can make them an easier sell.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages and disadvantages of using convertible notes for financing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any fundraising strategy, there are pros and cons of using convertible notes to finance your company\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-small-business-growth-strategies-that-will-yield-immediate-results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advantages of convertible notes<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>You save money and time. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A convertible note term sheet is shorter and more straightforward than a priced round term sheet.

In addition to consulting your accountant and business lawyer for advice, make sure you take time to review your goals, discuss strategies with your team, and read up on the fundraising market for your industry.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convertible notes might be a great option for you to raise money during your seed round if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to fundraise quickly.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to save money in legal fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want more time to see how your company will grow before doing a valuation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to retain control over the fundraising process.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re prepared to pay interest on the note.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you like the flexibility of a convertible instrument but don\u2019t want to deal with accrued interest on your investments, you could also consider using a SAFE instead. However, if you want a better idea of your company\u2019s ownership and dilution, you may be more interested in the traditional path of a priced round.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter which route you choose, make sure you carefully weigh your options to figure out what makes the most sense for your company\u2019s immediate and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long-term growth<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
