Businesses often need access to funds to operate, and because cash flow gaps are not uncommon, many business owners find themselves without enough working capital.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might need to purchase or upgrade expensive equipment, or you could be waiting on payments from several clients. Situations like these can have a serious impact on cash flow and even threaten the stability of your business. If you have a line of credit in place, however, you can handle these challenges with confidence, knowing you have access to the capital your business needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When choosing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s essential to gain a clear understanding of the financial implications for your business. To ensure your business gets the most value from the lender and line of credit product, there are a handful of factors you may want to consider.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things to consider when shopping for a line of credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan terms are a key consideration when looking for a line of credit. Some companies specialize in longer payback periods, while others require quick repayment. Do you prefer monthly or weekly payments? Do you want to repay over 12, 24, or 52 weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it\u2019s important to think about the product experience and availability of customer support. In what ways will the lender provide support for your business? If you have a question about your line of credit, or if you need to resolve an issue, will you be helped in a timely manner?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, a traditional bank was one of your only options for getting access to a line of credit. However, due to advances in financial technology, business owners now have many more when they\u2019re looking for capital. With the help of algorithms, machine learning, and at-your-fingertips technology, online lenders can offer quicker and easier access to capital than traditional lenders \u2014 like banks and credit unions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More lending options mean more choice, and when you choose a line of credit product like a Fundbox Line of Credit, you\u2019ll have the option to upgrade to Fundbox Plus, which can provide many additional benefits to your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lower Fees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every lender is different, and their differences extend from their application process to their fees, penalties, qualification requirements, and timeline.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you finalize an application, it\u2019s important to compare fees and interest rates to ensure you\u2019re getting the best deal. It\u2019s also important to know if simply applying for a loan will impact your credit score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One such fee to consider is a draw fee, which you will incur each time you draw upon the line of credit. The draw fee varies based on the lender, but is usually between 1 and 2 percent of the amount withdrawn at the time. For example, if your line of credit has a draw fee of 2 percent and you draw $10,000, the draw fee would be $200.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your funding needs, financial health, and relationship with a lender, it might be in your best interest to opt for a premium tiered line of credit \u2014 like Fundbox Plus. For $99\/month, Fundbox Plus offers 20 percent lower fees on new draws. So, if you\u2019re planning to use your line of credit multiple times over the course of a year, it might make sense to consider a more premium line of credit option that offers lower fees and additional benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Time to Pay<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A generous grace period before repayment begins can give your business finances a leg up. With Fundbox Plus, you get up to 28 days before your repayment begins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This allows you to save what would otherwise be the initial payment, and you can use it to cover the cost of other timely, important expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider longer terms with lower payments. By extending your repayment term to 52 weeks, you can benefit from lower weekly\u00a0 payment amounts, which can help you save money in the long run.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Longer repayment terms can offer you additional flexibility on how you make use of your line of credit. For example, rather than making small, sporadic draws to cover cash flow gaps, you might draw on your line of credit to invest in expensive equipment or other costly business growth initiatives \u2014 all at a lower weekly payment amount because you have extended terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase your working capital without sacrificing cash flow. Shifting from a weekly repayment schedule to a monthly* repayment option could help you free up cash flow for the rest of the month, enabling you to invest in more time-sensitive expenses like a marketing or advertising campaign for a seasonal sale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Payments made once every four weeks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Priority Support\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use your business line of credit regularly, it\u2019s a good idea to consider overall product experience and how easily you can access the lender\u2019s support team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quality of the customer support you receive can be critical to your happiness with your business line of credit. Whether you have a quick question or need more customized assistance, it\u2019s valuable to be able to pick up the phone and get your question answered or problem resolved. Fundbox has invested in its customer support services, creating a highly skilled team that delivers a great experience both over the phone and via email. The support team even won the gold Stevie Award for outstanding customer support in the financial services category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fundbox Plus, you have access to a dedicated support number and email address, so you\u2019re sure to have your requests prioritized and managed by a highly trained representative.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exclusive Benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seventy-three percent of business owners admit to having felt lonely while running their company, with a third saying that they feel this way consistently, according to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ceotodaymagazine.com\/2017\/12\/73-of-sme-owners-admit-to-feeling-lonely\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> new research <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched by Ultimate Finance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a business owner can be exciting and satisfying, but it can also be isolating at times. It can be quite challenging for small business owners to find the community or support they need \u2014 especially on a tight budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support from a like-minded community of business professionals is an invaluable aspect of running a successful business.
