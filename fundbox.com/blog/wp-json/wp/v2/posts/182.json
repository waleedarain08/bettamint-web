The key to understanding what Obamacare will mean for your cash flow is understanding which provisions of the Act affect you, whether to opt into them and how to plan for any impact on cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you need to know.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the Affordable Care Act Means for Small Business<\/strong><br \/>\nLet\u2019s look at the facts.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the initial panic over Obamacare and its impact on small business hiring and cash flow may be overblown. For starters, very small businesses\u2014those with fewer than 50 full-time workers\u2014are exempt from a key provision of the Act which requires that larger employers must offer health care insurance (known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/glossary\/employer-shared-responsibility-payment\">Employer Shared Responsibility<\/a>). According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/101068005\">CNBC<\/a>, that leaves some <strong>96 percent<\/strong> of all U.S. businesses off the hook.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, if you have less than 50 full-time employees and do choose to offer insurance, starting on January 1, 2014, you can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/what-is-the-shop-marketplace\/\">Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)<\/a> to access lower-cost coverage offered by private insurance companies. In essence, SHOP creates a level playing field for smaller businesses that traditionally couldn\u2019t find affordable coverage because insurers were reluctant to take on a small insurance pool. With SHOP, these businesses can get up to a 50 percent subsidy on coverage.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:<\/strong> Although, health coverage through SHOP\u00a0starts as soon as January 1, 2014, you can enroll now and begin coverage any time after January 1, 2014.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Other AFA cost savings come in the form of tax credits. Qualifying businesses (those with less than 25 full-time equivalent employees making an average of about $50,000 a year or less) can also take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/will-i-qualify-for-small-business-health-care-tax-credits\">small business health care tax credit<\/a>\u00a0worth up to 50% of your premium costs (beginning 2014 the tax credit is available only for plans purchased through SHOP).<\/p>\n<p>If you have more than 50 full-time employees, you are required to offer insurance, although employers can offset some of the cost of the premium by passing it along to the employee. The truth is, according to government data, 96 percent of businesses with 50+ workers already offer health plans! Get more facts from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/do-i-have-to-offer-health-coverage-to-my-employees\/\">Healthcare.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some employers may find that employees don\u2019t sign up for coverage, choosing to enroll in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/marketplace\/individual\/\">Health Insurance Marketplace<\/a> instead. Younger employees may also stay on their parents plans or decline coverage entirely because they are in good health.<\/p>\n<p><b><i>Note<\/i><\/b><em>: If you are self-employed, SHOP won\u2019t apply to you. Instead, you can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/families\/\">Health Insurance Marketplace<\/a> for individuals &amp; families<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How Will the Affordable Care Act Affect Your Cash Flow?<\/strong><br \/>\nFor most small businesses, the law won\u2019t be as painful as first feared but it\u2019s important to know what to expect with your business\u2019 health care premiums. Here are a few steps you can take to get answers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Talk to your insurance agent or broker<\/b> and be sure to fall back on them to help you comply with the form-filling and reporting aspects of the law.<\/li>\n<li><b>If you already offer employees coverage, determine whether SHOP is a better option for your business&#8217;s finances.\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Talk to your tax advisor about credits. <\/b>Your tax advisor can also help you understand your eligibility for the Small Business Health Credit and ensure you don\u2019t incur any penalties for non-compliance.<\/li>\n<li><b>Get assistance from the government<\/b>. If you have questions about the SHOP marketplace and have fewer than 50 employees, take advantage of the government\u2019s free hotline.\u00a0Call 1-800-706-7893, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST. The Small Business Administration also blogs regularly on the topic and hosts webinars to help small businesses understand the law and its impact on them. Visit\u00a0SBA.gov\/healthcare\u00a0for details<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Next, set a budget and decide how much you can afford to contribute towards your employees or your health care plans. You are only required to pay what you can afford. Don\u2019t forget to factor in any tax credits to your calculation.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, small businesses with less than 25 full-time employees are not required to offer health insurance; however, it\u2019s an attractive benefit that can help boost your appeal to potential employees and retain existing ones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><br \/>\nDo your research now to prevent any cash flow issues down the line. Determine whether you are going to offer this benefit to employees. Where will you buy coverage from (SHOP or directly from an insurance provider)? What credits are you eligible for?
