More importantly, do you enjoy it? If so, you&#8217;d be well-suited to open your own wedding photography and videography business. (If you&#8217;re worried about potential cash flow problems, there&#8217;s more on that below.)<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re starting from scratch, you can set up a legit wedding photography and videography business by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themoderntog.com\/cost-start-a-photography-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spending roughly $15,000<\/a>. This price includes all of your equipment and software costs (e.g. cameras, lenses, memory cards, flashes, Photoshop subscription, etc.), legal expenses, and incorporation fees\u2014as well as the costs associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themoderntog.com\/beginners-guide-to-creating-a-pro-photography-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">setting up and hosting your website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Never forget that your business is responsible for preserving memories from the most important days of your customers&#8217; lives. When it comes to <a href=\"http:\/\/shotkit.com\/wedding-photography-camera-gear\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buying equipment<\/a>, don&#8217;t skimp on the quality of your camera and lenses. You want to make sure you can provide the best pictures possible.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll definitely be able to tackle some jobs on your own, but if all goes well, you&#8217;ll need extra hands to call upon from time to time\u2014if not often. Develop a pool of talent you can tap into when you need it. The more reliable freelancers you have, the easier it&#8217;ll be to ensure you get the help you need.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;re comfortable with the equipment you have and the help that&#8217;s available to you, start marketing your business. Create a website and establish a presence on various social channels. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claim your listing on Google<\/a> to make it easy for customers to find you. Ask your friends, family members, and acquaintances whether they know anyone who&#8217;s looking for your services to see how much business you can generate organically.<\/p>\n<p>Sooner or later, you&#8217;ll land a gig. Do your best, learn from your experiences, and grow your business over time.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Watch Out for Potential\u00a0Cash Flow Problems<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>It would be great if wedding photographers and videographers could spend all their time focusing on perfecting their craft. Unfortunately, these folks aren&#8217;t immune from the same problems that all other small business owners run into every now and again.<\/p>\n<p>For example, photographers can face cash flow problems\u00a0for a number of reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Some jobs may require additional manpower. <\/strong>You might anticipate you&#8217;ll be able to do a gig by yourself only to realize you need to hire an extra set of hands or two you didn&#8217;t budget for.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Customers might not pay on time. <\/strong>Let&#8217;s say you land a bunch of jobs in July. Unfortunately, your customers might not be ready to pay you until September or beyond.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Equipment may break. <\/strong>You never want to shatter a lens or knock over lights, but it happens. You&#8217;ll need to replace your equipment when it breaks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You may be &#8220;forced&#8221; to buy new technologies or equipment. <\/strong>To stay competitive, you need to invest in new photography and videography equipment, editing software, and other technologies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You may be overwhelmed with work. <\/strong>There&#8217;s always the chance you&#8217;ll bite off more than you can chew from a cash flow perspective. Unpaid invoices don&#8217;t pay rent or salaries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Without access to cash, it&#8217;s impossible to grow your business. For example, when you&#8217;re low on cash, instead of hopping on the next gig that might require a second photographer, you&#8217;ll have to wait for a check to come in before making your next move.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that cash flow problems can be avoided if you take a proactive approach to your finances. By understanding the various funding options available, you&#8217;re able to give your business the money it needs to grow\u2014the moment you need it.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Solving Cash Flow Problems with Fundbox<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>While your accounts receivables might look nice on your balance sheet, you can&#8217;t exactly meet your financial obligations with invoices that are collecting dust.
