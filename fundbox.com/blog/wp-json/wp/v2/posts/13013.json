This article shares tips on how to help keep customers satisfied, employees safe, and cash flowing, even during a lockdown. I<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">n states without official lockdowns, most have cities and counties encouraging their citizens to self-isolate. As a service business still trying to operate, your \u201cnew normal\u201d probably includes figuring out how to keep customers satisfied, employees safe, and cash flowing.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essential vs Nonessential\u00a0Services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the federal government is pretty much leaving it up to state and local governments about which are essential and nonessential businesses, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisa.gov\/publication\/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has issued guidance on which businesses and which workers are considered essential to our country\u2019s infrastructure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While recreational businesses are considered nonessential and anything to do with medical care, food production, utilities and communication are definitely deemed essential, there are some gray areas when it comes to service businesses. Officially, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the DHS explains<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the advisory list of essential workers as:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c\u2026workers who conduct a range of operations and services that are typically essential to continued critical infrastructure viability, including staffing operations centers, maintaining and repairing critical infrastructure, operating call centers, working construction, and performing operational functions, among others. It also includes workers who support crucial supply chains and enable functions for critical infrastructure. The industries they support represent, but are not limited to, medical and healthcare, telecommunications, information technology systems, defense, food and agriculture, transportation and logistics, energy, water and wastewater, law enforcement, and public works.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, plumbers, yes and dog care services, no? Not necessarily. Again, you need to turn to your local government for clarification. While some states specifically name veterinary offices and pet supply stores only as essential, other states are more vague, stating \u201cpet supply and services\u201d are essential and therefore exempt from closing. Nonetheless, your service business\u2019s customers will continue to need what you provide. Your first challenge is to understand whether or not your business falls under the definition of &#8220;essential service&#8221; which varies from state to state. Then, IF your business qualifies as essential, your next challenge will be to figure out how to conduct business and deliver your product or service to the public without risking their health\u2014and the health of your employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety All Around<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never is transparency and communication more important to a business than during a crisis. If you as a business owner are confused about critical safety measures (e.g. mask or no mask?), then you know your employees and customers are, too. What\u2019s going to make the difference is clearly communicating your policies and procedures for keeping everyone safe from infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t already changed your website\u2019s homepage to acknowledge the crisis, that\u2019s\u00a0 a good place to start. =Consider including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any scheduling modifications, such as delayed response times or shortened hours.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best way to connect with you if your office is closed<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What procedures you have in place for safety such as having employees masked and gloved, sanitizing tools, or whatever you are doing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are still sending employees out to complete services, you can ask customers to please notify you if there has been any sickness in their homes or offices.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, be sure and keep in constant communication with employees about their home situations, their self-sanitizing methods and any fears they have about contracting the virus. You may need to get creative and allow more flexibility with schedules as the virus continues to spread and inhibit people\u2019s lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go Virtual<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay-at-home orders don\u2019t have to be as detrimental as they once would have been\u2014especially for service businesses. With the right technology and cybersecurity measures in place, you and employees could make the move to a home office without skipping a beat. Graphic designers, web services, accounting services, consultants and more probably already offer remote working options to employees, so set up is a no-brainer. For businesses yet to jump on the virtual train, the transition isn\u2019t as painful as you might think. Investing in a good project management program helps, so everyone stays current on project progression. Also, helpful is to schedule regular virtual meetings over video conferencing apps such as Skype or Zoom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might find your staff already has the technology in place to make remote working a possibility. For those who don\u2019t, allowing staff to take workstations home temporarily isn\u2019t a big deal, as long as you both understand how to lower the security risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees will most likely need access to your company\u2019s virtual private network (VPN), which is where the risks occur. Before allowing anyone access, Consider establishing remote security policies employees are required to follow. Of course, guidelines depend on the sensitivity of your company\u2019s information. The following may provide some basic tips:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardware and software anti-malware, firewalls, and antivirus\u00a0programs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encryption policies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access privileges and authentication<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connectivity guidelines<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password protocols<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acceptable use policies<br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help With Payroll<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re like most small businesses right now, you might be facing the challenge to keep employees on the payroll during the crisis.
