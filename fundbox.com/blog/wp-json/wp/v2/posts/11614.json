Today, the SBA connects business owners with financing and education. Since its inception, the SBA has enabled millions of loans, and countless business counseling, training, and mentorship sessions across many groups and dozens of district and regional offices.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/person\/kathleen-mcshane\">Kathleen McShane<\/a><\/span> is the Assistant Administrator and the proud leader in charge of overseeing the SBA Women\u2019s Business Centers throughout the country.

In a recent phone call, she shared her perspective with us on what has and has not changed for women at work, and her hopes for how the SBA can continue to support women in the future.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10484\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10484\" style=\"width: 343px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-10484\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Headshot_kathleen-mcshane.jpg\" alt=\"Kathy McShane, Assistant Administrator, SBA\" width=\"343\" height=\"403\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Kathy McShane, Assistant Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fundbox:<\/span>\u00a0The business landscape is always changing. In 2019, what is your top advice for women who want to not just grow their businesses but truly thrive in environments or industries where female leadership may not be the norm?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Kath<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">leen<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0McShane:<\/span>\u00a0If you asked me that question 10 years ago, I&#8217;m sorry to say the answer would be pretty much the same.<\/p>\n<p>A lot has\u00a0changed in terms of support for women who want to launch or expand a business, but a lot has <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not<\/span>\u00a0changed in terms of the biases that are associated with women and the fact that women really don&#8217;t have the access [to capital] that they need.<\/p>\n<p>When I talk this way, I&#8217;m speaking\u00a0generally, [from my experience]. I also believe\u00a0that women haven&#8217;t changed <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">enough<\/span>\u00a0in terms of how we\u00a0see ourselves.<br \/>\nAs much as it has to do with [gender]\u00a0bias [in business], a lot of it has to do with the way women approach business, which\u00a0is totally different from how\u00a0men approach it. That\u00a0doesn&#8217;t mean that one approach is right and one is wrong. It simply means that women approach things differently.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we find that\u00a0many women don&#8217;t typically go into business explicitly to make a lot of money, whereas men\u00a0[will say they] go into business to make money. It&#8217;s clear that that&#8217;s what they want to do.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What a lack of confidence costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3>What is so different about how the women you see approach business?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">KM:<\/span>\u00a0With many women, their confidence level can be lacking. [In my experience at the SBA], we think\u00a0anecdotally that Women\u2019s Business Center (WBC)\u00a0programs can\u00a0increase their confidence. We do a study every year because we&#8217;re instructed\u00a0by Congress to talk about what we&#8217;ve done and what the outcomes have been, and I included a question\u00a0about confidence.<\/p>\n<p>In our recent\u00a0study, 76\u00a0percent\u00a0of\u00a0women strongly agreed or agreed that going through services that are women-centered\u00a0increased their confidence. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">[Editor<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2019s note: According to a representative for the SBA, this survey was internal and has not been published.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Confidence affects our success. For example, some women don&#8217;t think of themselves as worthy, which keeps them from charging\u00a0properly for their services. I say, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t have enough confidence to charge me properly, why should I have confidence in you to hire you?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that we worked on in [my former company] the Ladies Launch Club, was\u00a0to really begin to shift the mindset.<\/p>\n<p>When women\u00a0work with other people to increase their confidence, when they&#8217;re willing to go into a mastermind group or\u00a0peer to peer advisory group, and have others challenge them, and not feel defeated afterwards, that goes a long way.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Positive psychology as a crucial tool<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3>You have\u00a0been trained in positive psychology. Do you recommend women business owners\u00a0look into this as a way of shifting their mindset?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">K<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">M<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:<\/span>\u00a0Absolutely positively, women should take positive psychology, and that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to go to Penn as\u00a0I did.<\/p>\n<p>I was actually going to start a business running positive psychology workshops, that&#8217;s why I did it. I&#8217;ve actually been considering putting some curriculum in our WBCs that actually addresses positive psychology. It almost makes me want to start another\u00a0business because it gives me goosebumps.<\/p>\n<p>It is so amazingly powerful\u00a0in terms of shifting the mindset. It\u2019s a way for you to look at the world in a different fashion. We\u00a0tend to internalize, women especially. We\u00a0think things are\u00a0always our\u00a0fault.<\/p>\n<p>The protocol that one uses in positive psychology stops you, and you&#8217;ll ask yourself questions. &#8220;What is this triggering in me? What do I do to stop it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When you start thinking about these things, seeing those barriers becomes much more obvious, so\u00a0you can act with intention.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Training, mentorship, and what women gain at the WBC<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3>Your work with the SBA and the Women&#8217;s Business Centers is specifically focused on training and providing mentorship to women. What can female entrepreneurs gain from working with the centers?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">KM:<\/span>\u00a0There are a number of things that they can gain. One is that confidence factor that I pointed out. From that same study I mentioned, 91\u00a0percent\u00a0of respondents said that they would recommend a WBC.<\/p>\n<p>What women walk away with is what I describe as technical training. That includes [things like], how do I market a product or a service? How do I use social media? How do I use QuickBooks or any of those services that are out there? How actually do I write an application to get funding?<\/p>\n<p>We work with women to help them with all of these\u00a0tactical things.<\/p>\n<p>We also offer a secure environment for women to be really challenged and not feel as if they\u00a0are failures. Again, that requires a\u00a0whole mindset shift. Mastermind programs are unbelievable because that really makes a woman accountable. They&#8217;re given homework and they&#8217;ve got another five or six women in that program to provide a support system. They&#8217;re not going to come back not having accomplished that homework.<\/p>\n<p>The peer-to-peer advising is really powerful because generally, people who have different experiences come from a totally different point of view. The fuzziness is diminished\u00a0because somebody will say, &#8220;Wait a minute, that doesn&#8217;t make a bit of sense to me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of our centers are actually testing\u00a0matching women with mentors. Those mentors deliver two things. One is that counseling, but they also become role models. Women don&#8217;t have a ton of role models. This matching addresses that.<\/p>\n<h3>Why are\u00a0mentoring and matching so important? What impact do you believe that they will have?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">KM:<\/span>\u00a0Again, women often don&#8217;t have mentors. When they decide to launch or expand a business, they really feel that they&#8217;re all alone. Many do not know where to go to get\u00a0help. If they have a mentor that says, &#8220;There are three or four or seven organizations out there that you should look into. Or of those seven that are out there, this, given what your challenges are, is the best for you,&#8221; that is extremely powerful.<\/p>\n<p>Those mentors will also challenge those women and they&#8217;ll challenge in a very\u00a0positive way, which\u00a0allows the woman to get\u00a0clearer in terms of her business proposition.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s\u00a0the SBA\u00a0attitude toward promoting and supporting women in\u00a0entrepreneurship generally?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">KM:<\/span>\u00a0The attitude of the organization is very much to support entrepreneurs. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/the-state-of-small-business-linda-mcmahon\/\">Administrator McMahon<\/a><\/span>\u00a0has a certain loyalty to female entrepreneurs because she was one. She knows what it was like. My group, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/offices\/headquarters\/wbo\">Office of Women&#8217;s Business Ownership<\/a><\/span>,\u00a0is\u00a0solely focused on women.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, if a man does want to go through the program, of course, we would accept them. The other SBA groups are more focused on\u00a0where a business\u00a0is in its\u00a0life cycle.<\/p>\n<h3>When it comes to firms in the financial industry, financial technology firms like Fundbox or others, what do you think these firms can do or should be doing to help promote financial inclusion, especially among women business owners?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">KM: <\/span>I think the first thing is awareness. How do I make sure that my centers are aware of people like you that are out there?<\/p>\n<p>I love the idea of your project, [the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/we-analyzed-the-gender-credit-gap-and-the-results-are-eye-opening\/\">What If whitepaper on the gender credit gap<\/a><\/span>].\u00a0It&#8217;s more important because it is educational. I want to\u00a0send [information about this]\u00a0to all my WBCs so that they become educated about what&#8217;s out there.<\/p>\n<p>We\u00a0have over 100 centers throughout the country. We plan to, in early 2019, open more. We&#8217;re committed to helping. However, we like the idea of working with other people who have great expertise in areas that perhaps my centers don&#8217;t, and\u00a0are willing to educate my centers in terms of what is available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">About Women\u2019s Business Centers<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Women&#8217;s Business Centers (WBCs) represent a network of over 100 centers throughout the U.S. and its territories.
