The 16-day government shutdown of 2013 resulted in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/government-shutdown-history-3368274\">$24 billion<\/a><\/span>\u00a0in lost economic output and there\u2019s seemingly no end in sight for the current one as each side battles over funding priorities.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, the first in a two-part series on government shutdowns, we\u2019re looking at how the fallout affects the small business community.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five scenarios when government shutdowns can hurt small business.<\/p>\n<h2>1. \u00a0When Your Customer is the Federal Government or a Contractor<\/h2>\n<p>The federal government is the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/contracting\/what-government-contracting\/sbas-role-government-contracting\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/contracting\/what-government-contracting\/sbas-role-government-contracting\">largest single purchaser<\/a><\/span>\u00a0of goods and services in the world, awarding $500 billion in contracts every year. Everything from paper clips to missiles, computer software to marketing communication services, the government buys it all. And it\u2019s not just from large contractors.<\/p>\n<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) works with federal agencies to award nearly one quarter of prime government contracting dollars to small businesses in accordance with statutory goals. These \u201cset-asides\u201d, as they\u2019re known, generate millions of dollars in payments and support a broad ecosystem of prime and sub-contractors.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">The Impact<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>When the government closes, not only do federal contracts stop paying out, but the opportunity to bid for new business also dries up, since everyone (except critical government employees) is furloughed. Even during the brief January 2018 shutdown, contractors received \u201cstop work\u201d orders from agencies. This equates to tense times for small business and can cost employees and subcontractors their jobs, at least temporarily.<\/p>\n<h2>2. \u00a0If You\u2019re Looking for an SBA Loan<\/h2>\n<p>When the government shuts down, the SBA stops processing loan applications submitted by financial institutions on behalf of their clients (<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/sba-loans\/\">SBA doesn\u2019t provide the funds<\/a>, rather they guarantee the loan giving the lender a lifeline should the business owner default). In fact, it\u2019s against the law for federal employees to do any work, even check email, when they\u2019re furloughed.<\/p>\n<p>If your small business is looking for cash to grow or expand, you won\u2019t get an answer on whether the loan is approved until the government returns to work. The exception is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/disaster-assistance\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/disaster-assistance\">SBA disaster loans<\/a><\/span>\u00a0that help small business and home-owners recover from declared disasters.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">The Impact<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>During the prolonged 2013 shutdown (16 days),\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/on-small-business\/shutdown-yields-slowdown-sba-returns-to-hundreds-of-small-business-loan-applications\/2013\/10\/18\/525edad8-37f7-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?utm_term=.2d12e873dd59\">700 loan applications<\/a><\/span>\u00a0piled up in a queue while the agency was closed. The Washington Post <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/on-small-business\/shutdown-yields-slowdown-sba-returns-to-hundreds-of-small-business-loan-applications\/2013\/10\/18\/525edad8-37f7-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?utm_term=.2d12e873dd59\">cited<\/a><\/span>\u00a0several examples of small business owners left in limbo when the SBA held up their loans. For example, Chris Leh, president of TL Technologies in Lancaster, PA., told a congressional hearing that he had to cancel a $600,000 equipment order and rescind two job offers to highly trained machinists because his SBA loan application was not approved before the 2013 shutdown.<\/p>\n<p>Then-acting SBA Administrator, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/on-small-business\/shutdown-yields-slowdown-sba-returns-to-hundreds-of-small-business-loan-applications\/2013\/10\/18\/525edad8-37f7-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?utm_term=.815579dbb7a3\">Jeanne Hulit, <\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/on-small-business\/shutdown-yields-slowdown-sba-returns-to-hundreds-of-small-business-loan-applications\/2013\/10\/18\/525edad8-37f7-11e3-80c6-7e6dd8d22d8f_story.html?utm_term=.815579dbb7a3\">wrote<\/a><\/span>, \u201cDuring the shutdown, I heard stories from small business owners about contracts cancelled or put on hold, workers they had to furlough, and the potential for shift and staff reductions\u2026many small businesses are still struggling with how to take care of their employees as they see projects postponed.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. \u00a0If your livelihood depends on tourism<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most indelible images of all government \u00a0shutdowns is the closure signs posted outside national parks and landmarks. While some parks remain open during the current shutdown, albeit with a reduced level of service, many smaller sites are shuttered. If your business is located in the vicinity of a park, any closure can have devastating consequences.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">The Impact<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>Cancellations and reductions in traffic threatens small business livelihoods. National Park shutdown costs are already at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/greenwire\/2019\/01\/04\/stories\/1060110987\">$5 million<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and rising and our nation\u2019s parks face <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/environment\/2019\/01\/why-national-parks-trashed-during-government-shutdown\/\">years of damage <\/a><\/span>as a result.<\/p>\n<h2>4. \u00a0If you\u2019re planning to hire<\/h2>\n<p>One overlooked aspect of the government shutdown is the government\u2019s<a href=\"http:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/e-verify\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/e-verify\">E-Verify website<\/a><\/span>\u00a0used to verify the eligibility of individuals to work in the U.S. During any shutdown, per the<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.e-verify.gov\/e-verify-and-e-verify-services-are-unavailable\">\u00a0Department of Homeland Security and USCIS<\/a><\/span>, employers will not be able to access their online accounts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">The Impact<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>While it shouldn\u2019t delay your hiring plans (USCIS usually approves a workaround), the E-Verify shutdown puts businesses at risk of non-compliance if they skip this important step to ensuring a legal workforce.<\/p>\n<h2>5. \u00a0If military personnel are your big customers<\/h2>\n<p>Without an exemption, military personnel can be furloughed and lose pay during a shutdown.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">The Impact<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p>If your business is located near a military base or is positioned in a military installation, lack of disposable income could hit your business hard during a shutdown.<\/p>\n<h2>The bottom line<\/h2>\n<p>Brief or prolonged, a federal government shutdown can throw a wrench in the works of business operations and plans. Shutdowns are a serious blow to small businesses and affect their ability to serve customers, access finance, invest, and ultimately, grow.<\/p>\n<p>According to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.smallbusinessmajority.org\/press-release\/government-shutdown-creates-uncertainty-small-businesses\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smallbusinessmajority.org\/press-release\/government-shutdown-creates-uncertainty-small-businesses\">Small Business Majority<\/a><\/span>, every time the government closes shop it diminishes consumer confidence and creates a huge amount of uncertainty.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for part two in this series, where we\u2019ll discuss ways small business can plan for and mitigate the effect of government shutdowns if and when they happen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Government shutdowns, or the threat of them, have become a way of life in today\u2019s political climate.
