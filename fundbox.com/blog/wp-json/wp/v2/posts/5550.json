Video testimonials should be short but filled with information on how your business made the customer&#8217;s business better\/more profitable, solved a problem, etc.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Product demonstration videos<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Product demonstration videos are especially helpful for B2B buyers looking for a new source or a new way of accomplishing a goal. If appropriate, you can inject a bit of humor into the video so it doesn&#8217;t come off as dry and boring.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Tutorial videos<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Marketers are turning to video to show customers how to put a product together or the best way to use what your business is selling. No one wants to read a long instruction manual anymore.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Your story<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s always helpful to include on your website a video about your business and how it got started. You&#8217;re hoping to build a lasting relationship, so make sure your video introduces the founders and your staff\u2014and also gives a &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; look at how the business is run.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Webinars<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once you build some traffic, try hosting an instructional webinar where current and potential customers can talk to the experts. Encourage attendees on your social media platforms and provide an incentive to watch, such as a free newsletter or coupon.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Video blogs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Instead of just writing about topics related to your industry, have someone videotape you or a staff member <em>talking<\/em> about a subject relevant to your company. Watch your social media channels for recurring questions or issues, then turn those issues into video blogs so everyone can benefit from the answers. Once you have a few video blogs under your belt, offer to video blog for other websites to get the word out about your business.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to a forecast from Cisco, as much as 80 percent of consumer Internet traffic\u00a0will be devoted to watching video &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":5708,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10158],"yst_prominent_words":[4097,5278,4408,723,938,7288,4763,7290,808,807,1657,7289,7286,804,794,2244,7287,4410,776,3453],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"B2B Marketing with Online Video | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"As B2B business owners continuously look for ways to attract and engage buyers, video has proven to positively affect B2B marketing results."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"B2B Marketing with Online Video | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"As B2B business owners continuously look for ways to attract and engage buyers, video has proven to positively affect B2B marketing results."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/b2b-marketing-online-video\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_316715393.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_316715393.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"800"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"As B2B business owners continuously look for ways to attract and engage buyers, video has proven to positively affect B2B marketing results."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"B2B Marketing with Online Video | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/shutterstock_316715393.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/b2b-marketing-online-video\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5550"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5550"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5550\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14469,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5550\/revisions\/14469"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5708"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5550"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5550"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5550"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=5550"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
