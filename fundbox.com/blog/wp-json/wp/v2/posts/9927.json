But one professional <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.waspbarcode.com\/small-business-report-accounting\">tops the list<\/a><\/span>\u00a0in order of importance to small businesses \u2013 accountants.<\/p>\n<p>An accountant can do many things to help SBOs manage their finances, some well known some less well known\u00a0. \u00a0At the end of the day, a good accountant is an invaluable resource who can help you make more informed decisions about managing your taxes, hiring, developing budgets, protecting cash flow, and more.<\/p>\n<p>But where do you find a good accountant? What criteria should you use for evaluating one?<\/p>\n<p>In this article, part of our <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Small Business Guide to Accounting <\/span>series, we answer these questions and put you on the right path to a rewarding accountant relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Find an Accountant for your Business<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing to recognize about finding an accountant is that the relationship is for the long haul. An accountant is a trusted advisor who will get to know and advise on the most intimate details of your business. Searching online for such a valued resource is like opening a can of worms, you\u2019ll be bombarded with sponsored ads and listings with no real way of determining who\u2019s worth pursuing and who\u2019s not.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, start your search with referrals. Pick the brains of fellow business owners, ask your lawyer, or banker. Your local chamber of commerce or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/tools\/local-assistance\/sbdc\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/tools\/local-assistance\/sbdc\">Small Business Development Center<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are great meeting points for business owners. Attend a few networking or meet-up events, you\u2019ll be surprised how eager your peers are to offer recommendations.<\/p>\n<h2>Understand the Difference Between a CPA, a Bookkeeper, and an Accountant<\/h2>\n<p>Not all accountants are created equal. So, it\u2019s important to understand your accounting needs before you start your search.<\/p>\n<p>A bookkeeper, for example, is someone who can help record transactions, such as accounts receivable and payable, pay sales taxes, etc. But a bookkeeper can\u2019t offer financial or tax advice.<\/p>\n<p>An accountant, on the other hand, does all the above, but they also prepare financial statements (profit and loss statement, balance sheet, etc.) and taxes.<\/p>\n<p>However, a regular accountant is not recognized by the IRS as representing clients. For this, you\u2019ll need a CPA or tax attorney.<\/p>\n<p>A CPA is top of the ladder when it comes to accounting. They have passed exams and achieved certifications. A CPA is more knowledgeable in tax codes than an accountant and is eligible to sign tax returns on your behalf and represent you in front of the IRS in the event of an audit. In addition, a CPA can perform financial statement audits and reviews.<\/p>\n<p>To find a CPA you can use your referral network or search the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)<a href=\"https:\/\/www.aicpa.org\/forthepublic\/findacpa.html\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aicpa.org\/forthepublic\/findacpa.html\">website<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Evaluate Candidates for your Accounting Needs<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have a pool of possible candidates, it\u2019s time to find out which one is the right fit for your needs, business, industry, and preferred way of working. As you meet and greet accountants, have a list of prepared questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cTell me about your experience with small business\u201d. <\/span>Small businesses have unique challenges and dynamic accounting needs. Focus can shift in the blink of an eye from cash flow concerns to taxes to hiring to needing help with a loan application. What experience does the accountant have with small businesses? Do they work much with businesses structured like yours, whether you\u2019re a sole proprietor, LLC, partnership, or S corporation? Ask for references to back up any answers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cHow familiar are you with my industry?<\/span>\u201d Accountants often specialize in certain industries. If you\u2019re a franchise, for example, it would be helpful to have an accountant who understands franchise business models.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cWhat range of services do you provide?<\/span>\u201d<a href=\"http:\/\/www.waspbarcode.com\/small-business-report-accounting\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.waspbarcode.com\/small-business-report-accounting\">71%<\/a><\/span>\u00a0of small businesses turn to an accountant to help with tax preparation. But that\u2019s not all they do. Accountants can provide long-term strategic advice and help with important accounting tasks like budgeting, payroll, accounts receivable management, as well as informing growth decisions like hiring, financing, etc. In addition to asking what services they provide, don\u2019t shy away from asking how they can help you grow your business too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cHow do you bill for services?\u201d <\/span>Most accountants charge by the hour. However, others may offer a monthly retainer. Dig deep to understand what the fee includes, are there any add-ons? Shop around to get an idea of a price point and model that works for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cWho\u2019s my point of contact?<\/span>\u201d Since an accountant is a trusted advisor, find out who you\u2019ll be working with day-to-day. Smaller firms may team you with a senior partner which might be a better fit for you as you seek to build a lasting relationship. Larger firms may not provide this kind of personal touch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u201cHow will you get to know my business?<\/span>\u201d Even if your accountant is just doing your taxes, they need to get to know your business so that they can help you make informed decisions. How will they approach this task? Other things to consider is how you\u2019ll work together? What kind of schedule will they keep? How often will you meet (in person, by phone)? How quickly do they respond to questions and requests?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Choosing an accountant is one of the most important decisions an SBO will make. Take your time with your search, don\u2019t just rush into a relationship during tax season, plan, assess your needs, but don\u2019t put off this important milestone in your business growth until it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<h3>Previously in the Small Business Guide to Accounting:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-accounting-method-business-cash-accrual\/\">Which is the Best Accounting Method for your Business, Cash or Accrual?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/accountant-can-business-cant\/\">What an Accountant Can Do for Your Business, and What They Can\u2019t<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/12-accounting-terms-every-small-business-owner-should-know\/\">12 Accounting Terms Every Business Owner Should Know<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><small><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Disclaimer: The information in this blog doesn\u2019t replace the advice of a tax or legal expert.
