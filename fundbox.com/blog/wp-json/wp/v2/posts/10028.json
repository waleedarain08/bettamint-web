Buying a business is a big move \u2014\u00a0one that has the potential to take your company to the next level. But how do you know if it\u2019s the right decision for you?<\/p>\n<p>We talked to business owner <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trianglepest.com\/about-us\/team\/donnie-shelton\">Donnie Shelton<\/a><\/span>\u00a0\u2014 owner of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trianglepest.com\/\">Triangle Pest Control<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coalmarch.com\/\">Coalmarch<\/a><\/span>\u00a0\u2014 and learned more about his experience (and tips around) purchasing a second business.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re mulling over a buying opportunity right now, or simply gathering information for the future, here are the key steps to take when making your decision.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Examine your motivation<\/h2>\n<p>First, determine <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">why<\/span>\u00a0you want to purchase another business. Do you want to buy out the competition to gain more customers? Are you trying to break into a new industry? Or, maybe you\u2019re looking for something to complement and build upon your current business, as was the case for Shelton.<\/p>\n<p>After growing his pest control business into a million-dollar enterprise, Shelton purchased the marketing agency he was working with, in the hopes of building it into a resource for business owners in the lawn care and pest control industries. \u201cThe home services niche tends to be behind the times,\u201d he explained, \u201cand there was a real chance to turn this into an opportunity to help other business owners grow their businesses and their teams into the digital age.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pinpointing your motivation for buying a second company will help you figure out your goals \u2014 and what you need to do to achieve them.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Figure out what changes you\u2019d have to make<\/h2>\n<p>Logistically, you need to consider the size and location of the business, as well as its industry, customer base, and competitors. Another important factor is considering how, or even if, your two businesses will mesh together.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor my first [business],\u201d Shelton said, \u201cI cared a lot about profitability and scalability, so I&#8217;d be able to grow it quickly. For the second, I had to consider how it would fit into what I already had.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Take some time to determine what changes you\u2019d have to make in your current business operations and personal life to successfully grow a second business, as well as how long those changes would take to implement. \u201cWhen the opportunity came along [to buy my second business],\u201d Shelton said, \u201cI had built a team that was running efficiently so I was able to be less involved in the day-to-day operations.\u201d This allowed him to allocate more time and resources to his second business.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to figure out whether or not you\u2019re in the position to, say, expand your managerial staff or cut back on your hours if you need to. Shelton said, \u201cMy entire business philosophy is all about keeping the wheel balanced \u2014 you have to be focused on serving your vendors, your customers, your employees, and your owner evenly.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>3. Take stock of your financial situation<\/h2>\n<p>Purchasing another business is a massive investment, so it\u2019s important to have all the facts before you make an offer. First, examine your current business to see how well it\u2019s performing. What were the last quarter\u2019s profits like? What do you estimate you\u2019ll earn going forward? What are your funding options like?<\/p>\n<p>Confidence in your ability to grow the new company, and knowing you have the resources to support yourself in case things go awry, can go a long way. \u201cI was willing to take a bigger financial risk knowing that I had a solution in mind for something a lot of people in the pest and lawn industries face,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cI also had the success of my first business to fall back on, and a partnership between the two that would reinforce both,\u201d he explained.<\/p>\n<p>Savings are crucial in any case, Shelton added. No matter how comfortable you feel, it\u2019s wise to pad your budget to account for unforeseen obstacles and potential profit loss during the transition period. Securing <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundingcircle.com\/us\/small_business_loans\/\">financing for your business<\/a><\/span>\u00a0can also help. Having additional cash flow to purchase equipment, hire new staff, or maintain operations\u00a0can help give you flexibility and peace of mind, allowing you to focus on growing your business instead of scrambling.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Do your due diligence<\/h2>\n<p>Before you buy a business \u2014 and potentially inherit piles of debt \u2014 do your homework to investigate its financial health. Some businesses look squeaky clean on the surface, but actually, have tons of problems. Consider hiring a business broker or working with an independent valuations firm. They\u2019ll help you determine how much the business is worth and outline any financial hiccups the business has encountered in the past, so you know exactly what you\u2019re getting into.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Outline a growth plan<\/h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most important question to ask yourself is: How will you add value to the new company? Contemplate what strategies you\u2019d employ for improving profits, expanding its customer base, and managing employees. It\u2019s also a good idea to figure out whether you\u2019d want to oversee and run your second business similarly to your first one, or adopt a different approach.<\/p>\n<p>Shelton said that just because you own two companies doesn\u2019t mean you have to run them the same way. \u201cThere&#8217;s some overlap in the fundamental values of both [my businesses] because I&#8217;ve been involved, but the culture and the processes are entirely different,\u201d he explained. Despite the differences, Shelton said he believes both his businesses continue to thrive because they serve one another.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing embedded in the pest control industry and understanding the challenges small business owners face there has given us a lot of insight into serving our clients at Coalmarch. And being able to gain insight from the agency side on how to stay competitive and what customers are looking for has helped us to continue to grow Triangle across state lines,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<h2>Bottom line<\/h2>\n<p>Buying a second business can open doors for you to earn more money and expand your skill-set as an entrepreneur. However, it\u2019s certainly not a decision you should make lightly as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/12\/a-5-step-process-for-reorganizing-after-a-merger\">it could actually end up harming your newly-formed organization<\/a><\/span>.
