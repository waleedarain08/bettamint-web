Multiple elements go into a successful blog strategy, but the one that has most impact on sales is blog traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Blog traffic doesn\u2019t just happen: You have to work at it. Content needs to be refined so that it appeals to the reader. Opportunities must\u00a0be created in order to share the blog with a wider audience. And stickiness needs to be fashioned so that the reader is encouraged to explore other areas of your site, respond to calls to action, and keep coming back.<\/p>\n<p>Here are seven tips, tricks, and tools for doing just that without breaking the bank.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Create a Killer Headline<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For me, this is blog success 101\u2014your blog headline is your only chance to catch the reader\u2019s attention and get a click. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conductor.com\/press-room\/5-data-insights-headlines-readers-click\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80% of readers never make it past the headline<\/a>. To optimize your clicks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid cryptic headlines (be explicit about the takeaways you\u2019re providing), but don\u2019t give it all away.<\/li>\n<li>Think of your headline as a way to pique curiosity.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid 2\u20133 word headlines; instead, aim for between 40\u201355 characters.<\/li>\n<li>Come up with a few options and test them to see which performs best.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>2. Get More Above the Fold<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;Above the fold&#8221; is an old publishing term for any content that appeared in the upper half of a folded newspaper. Today it\u2019s used to refer to the portion of a web page that is visible in a browser window without needing to scroll down. Studies show that on desktop browsers, readers interact with this area of a page more than any other (the 80\/20 rule applies to the top of the page versus the rest).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to organize and design your blog pages so that content you want to emphasize is above the fold, such as the headline, excerpts, social share icons, and a featured image. You could also use real estate on the right-hand side of your blog homepage to spotlight related blogs or marketing calls to action.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the example below from the Fundbox blog:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4479\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.44.18-AM.png\" alt=\"Why and How to Write Attention-Grabbing Blog Headlines to Increase Blog Traffic\" width=\"679\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.44.18-AM.png 951w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-11.44.18-AM-768x744.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The focus on &#8220;above the fold&#8221; content doesn\u2019t mean you should neglect &#8220;below the fold&#8221;. Mobile devices actually make it easier to scroll and swipe, so consider using a different, yet related call to action at the end of your post.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Publish Helpful, In-depth &#8220;How-To&#8221; Articles<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Now, I\u2019m not advocating this approach for each blog, but ensuring a good smattering of in-depth blogs (1,000\u20132,000 words) in your content strategy will not only boost your Google rankings (articles over 2,000 words do better)\u00a0but will also increase your social shares\u2014affecting your overall blog traffic. Why? Longer blogs give you the opportunity to write about a real challenge that your customers face and offer a &#8220;how-to&#8221; approach to fixing it (without being a full-on sales push). You could also talk about industry trends and how they impact your customers. In a nutshell, it helps demonstrate thought leadership and builds trust.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Share Content on Social Media, Wash, Repeat<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sharing your blogs on social media shouldn\u2019t be a one-off thing, especially on Twitter where tweets come and go in the blink of an eye. Give it a go and change up the message to see which gets the most traction over a 24-hour period. If your blog isn\u2019t time-sensitive, plan on posting about it on social media multiple times over the coming months to help drive more blog traffic via views and shares. You can automate this\u00a0with tools like Hootsuite and Facebook\u2019s scheduling tools.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Send an Email Each Time You Post New Content<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Extremely effective, yet often overlooked, make a point of sending out an email to your list each time a new blog article is posted\u2014these people chose to hear from you because they\u2019re interested in what you have to say! Just make sure you\u2019re not emailing\u00a0those who\u2019ve already subscribed to your blog updates. The same is true if you post a new ebook or white paper.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Use Tools to Boost Engagement and Blog Traffic<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are lots of tools that help you manage and grow your blog traffic organically.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in addition to your social share icons, take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/coschedule.com\/click-to-tweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule<\/a>, a nifty tool that takes the &#8220;Click to Tweet&#8221; concept to the next level (see below and used to effect in this <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/brush-off-your-marketing-with-this-6-point-year-end-checklist\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4476\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Picture2.png\" alt=\"CoSchedule engagement to increase blog traffic\" width=\"975\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Picture2.png 975w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Picture2-768x180.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Adding images also drives engagement and prompts viewers to\u00a0click through to other areas of your site. Flickr is a popular source of free images, but other options include PEXELS, Pixabay, and <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unsplash<\/a>. You can also create infographics or incorporate your own product or personal photos using free tools like Canva, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picmonkey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PicMonkey<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.easel.ly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">easel.ly<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/infogr.am\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Infogr.am<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/piktochart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Piktochart<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are many free tools that can help you fine-tune your copy and headlines without a hefty SEO investment.

Amplify Your Content as a Guest Blogger<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A great way to amplify your knowledge and drive blog traffic for your business\u00a0is to put effort into becoming a guest blogger on other sites. It\u2019s actually easier than it sounds.<\/p>\n<p>Start by identifying a shortlist of blogs or online communities that are complementary to your business, such as blogs written by your partners\/vendors, industry influencers, and even the media. Chances are they\u2019ll have a different and larger reader base than your blog. which will potentially increase your exposure. You don\u2019t even need to create new content, just <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/repurpose-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tweak articles<\/a> that you\u2019ve already written and see if they\u2019ll accept you into their guest program (most will have guest blogger rules that you\u2019ll need to comply with). Don\u2019t forget to share the love by opening your blog up to other guest blogging opportunities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many small business owners start a blog because they think it will help boost sales, but very quickly give up &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":4491,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10158],"yst_prominent_words":[6529,3456,6527,4408,4247,822,5238,6530,5403,6534,3466,4411,6531,804,794,6532,6528,3075,2244],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"7 Ways to Boost Blog Traffic on a Budget | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Multiple elements go into a successful blog strategy, but the one that has most impact on sales is blog traffic."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"7 Ways to Boost Blog Traffic on a Budget | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Multiple elements go into a successful blog strategy, but the one that has most impact on sales is blog traffic."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-boost-blog-traffic-budget-2\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/shutterstock_289434728-1.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/shutterstock_289434728-1.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"668"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Multiple elements go into a successful blog strategy, but the one that has most impact on sales is blog traffic."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"7 Ways to Boost Blog Traffic on a Budget | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/shutterstock_289434728-1.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-boost-blog-traffic-budget-2\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4473"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4473"}],"version-history":[{"count":20,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4473\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16157,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4473\/revisions\/16157"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4491"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4473"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4473"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4473"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=4473"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
