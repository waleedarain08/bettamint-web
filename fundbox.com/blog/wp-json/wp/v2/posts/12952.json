Here\u2019s how it works: If you keep your employees for eight weeks from the time your loan is originated and maintain their salaries (up until June 30, 2020), the SBA will forgive the portion of the loan you used to cover payroll, rent, mortgage interest, and utilities. However, due to the high number of businesses likely to enroll in the program, you need to use at least 75% of the forgiveness amount for payroll. Forgiveness is based on the employer maintaining or quickly rehiring employees and maintaining salary levels.\u00a0 Forgiveness will be reduced if full-time headcount declines, or if salaries and wages decrease<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a couple caveats, though. For instance, as The Chamber of Commerce\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/sites\/default\/files\/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guide explains<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, businesses can\u2019t factor in the salaries of employees who live outside the United States when calculating payroll, nor can they pay any individual employee an annual salary over $100,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forgiveness reductions and increases<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you lay off any of your employees within the eight-week time period or cut wages by more than 25% for individual employees who already earn under $100,000 a year, your loan forgiveness amount will be reduced, according to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/sites\/default\/files\/023595_comm_corona_virus_smallbiz_loan_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, as Neil Bradley, Vice President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce clarified in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/co\/events\/national-small-business-town-hall-inc-us-chamber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">town hall webinar<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on March 27, there are other factors that may count towards your payroll expenses. For example, if you increased employee wages or compensation during the eight-week period\u2014by covering employee tips, for example\u2014you may be eligible for additional loan forgiveness. Another benefit is that you can bring back any employees you\u2019ve already laid off to be eligible for the loan. You won\u2019t be penalized for re-hiring employees or reinstating their original wages as long as you keep them on payroll for the designated eight weeks.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan payments and logistics<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to borrow more money than your forgiveness amount to cover expenses like inventory, you can.
