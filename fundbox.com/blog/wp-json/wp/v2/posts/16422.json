As a product-based business, you\u2019re focused on making sure that your products are unique, high-quality, and marketable while managing the cost of producing, shipping, storing, and delivering those products to your customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.netsuite.com\/portal\/resource\/articles\/inventory-management\/inventory.shtml\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> refers to the stock of product you sell and can include raw materials, partially finished products, and packing materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory management is the process of ensuring that you have enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand while investing in new production and selling your inventory at a profitable rate. It also includes the logistics behind manufacturing your product and getting it out to your customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow goes hand-in-hand with inventory management. Carefully determining how your working capital is best used to invest in inventory is crucial to maintaining your profitability.

There are many factors affecting how much you need to spend on inventory that are likely to change as your business expands and responds to seasonal changes in sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re investing in inventory, you\u2019re often paying for more than just the product itself. It\u2019s important to understand all the costs associated with your inventory so you can optimize your inventory management strategy accordingly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cogs.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost of goods sold (COGS)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a good place to start. This number includes all expenses your business incurs to produce your product. You can find your COGS listed on your income statement or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/online-calculator.org\/cost-of-goods-sold-calculator.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use the COGS formula<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to calculate it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the costs that are associated with COGS and inventory acquisition in general include:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Manufacturing costs: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costs of the materials and labor needed to produce your goods.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Holding or carrying costs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The cost of storing and holding stock in a warehouse until it is sold to the customer or shipped to the retailer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Landed costs: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The costs of shipping and freight, import fees, taxes, duties, and other expenses associated with transporting inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Distribution costs:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The costs of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wallstreetmojo.com\/distribution-cost\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delivering your product<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the producer to retailers or customers. This is typically not included in your COGS calculation and can include the cost of marketing and advertising.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenges of inventory management<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major hurdles product-based businesses face is filling in the gaps between investing in inventory and getting paid for it. Depending on your business model, it could take months to see sales from inventory you\u2019ve purchased to cover the costs of that inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct-to-consumer brands have a different sales cycle than wholesale and B2B companies. For direct-to-consumer brands, situations like seasonal launches might require paying for product months ahead of the time it will be up for sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wholesalers working with third-party distributors often have to wait until retailers pay the distributor and for the distributor to pay them in turn. For B2B companies, there\u2019s often a time lag between receiving a purchase order (PO) from a customer and receiving payment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses also need to keep in mind that they need to have enough inventory to meet demand, but purchasing too much inventory can increase holding costs and impact your cash flow going forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solving inventory management challenges with a business line of credit<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mastering the ongoing juggling act between inventory management and cash flow is possible with the right resources. One of the ways businesses overcome the challenges associated with inventory management is with inventory financing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory financing is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/inventory-financing-loans\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">short-term loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or line of credit used to cover the upfront costs of purchasing inventory or investing in inventory-related expenses like manufacturing supplies or warehousing space. Inventory financing options typically use the inventory itself as collateral.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business lines of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the best option for small business inventory financing. Unlike a loan, a line of credit replenishes as you repay the balance. This allows you continuous access to the funds you need to front the cost of inventory. When you sell the inventory and cash flows in, you can pay off your line of credit and use the freed-up credit to purchase your next round of inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inventory financing with a line of credit enables you to stabilize your cash flow while you ensure that you have enough stock to meet the demands of your customers. It can also help you bridge seasonal gaps in sales and buy extra stock as you approach your busiest times of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a line of credit, you can also remain in good standing with your suppliers, potentially increasing your business credit score.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See how one of our customers, musical instrument retailer Ponce de Leon, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/case-studies\/how-a-synchrony-partner-usic-store-used-fundbox-to-invest-in-inventory\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uses a line of credit to get early payment discounts and stock unique, high-ticket products in their music store business.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Fundbox for inventory financing\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox offers lines of credit that businesses can use to finance their inventory management and operational costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a garden center might need to purchase extra stock ahead of their busy spring season. Using the line of credit, they can finance the cost of the inventory of plants and tools including warehousing, shipping, and even their increased greenhouse heating bill before they\u2019ve made a sale. When the busy season hits, they can then use that incoming revenue to pay down the revolving balance and use those funds again for more inventory or to cover new opportunities for growth, like a mid-season marketing campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox provides 12 and 24 week repayment periods with a consistent repayment amount so that you never fall behind on paying down your balance, empowering you to manage your cash flow even more consistently.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/flex-pay\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox Flex Pay <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can pay for inventory-related costs that you cannot put on a credit card (such as invoices to your suppliers) and have three extra days to pay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the inventory financing you need to invest in the business while effectively managing your cash flow. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a Fundbox line of credit to see if you qualify.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox makes capital available to businesses through business loans and lines of credit made by First Electronic Bank, a Utah chartered Industrial Bank, member FDIC, in addition to invoice-clearing advances, business loans, and lines of credit made directly by Fundbox.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
