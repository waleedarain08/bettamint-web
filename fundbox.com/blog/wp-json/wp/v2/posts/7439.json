Watching your <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow<\/a> dry up can be stressful\u2014even if <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you run a seasonal business <\/a>and you deal with this often. In fact, you may feel anxious waiting around for your sales to pick up again. This can cause you to make a snap decision to try to boost sales by discounting prices.<\/p>\n<p>Before you do this, however, you might want to think again. Discounting\u00a0products and services may seem like a smart way to boost sales, but\u00a0this can actually hurt your sales in the long run.

Likewise, if you have a blog but never write anything, <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/10-tips-for-starting-a-successful-blog-for-your-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">now is the time to get cracking.<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/thrivehive.com\/how-to-market-yourself-to-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blogging is an effective way to market<\/a> to your customers. It also gives you an outlet to position yourself as a knowledgeable resource in your field. Better yet, <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/does-your-business-need-a-blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blogging can improve your SEO and help you rank higher in a Google search. <\/a>This in turn can drive traffic back to your website and keep customers there to shop or learn more about your business.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Get reviews<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that only about two percent of online shoppers convert to buying customers on the first visit to a website? This means that regardless of what type of business you operate, you have to work hard to build trust in order to garner sales.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-market-millennials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Customer reviews are one of the top ways to build trust<\/a>. In fact, 61% of customers read reviews before making a purchase, and reviews are trusted 12 times more than product descriptions. Here&#8217;s the kicker: Reviews lead to an 18% uptick in product sales.<\/p>\n<p>If you have no reviews yet, no worries. You can ask a few customers to write brief, positive reviews and post them on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/sf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yelp<\/a> or to your Facebook page. You can then use your social media channels to share these positive testimonials.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Get social<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you are not already using social media to boost sales by marketing your business, products, or services in a big way, now is the time to start. According to Pew Research Center,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/2015\/10\/08\/social-networking-usage-2005-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 65% of adults were using social media sites in 2015<\/a>\u2014almost a ten-fold increase since 2005. As you can imagine, that percentage is probably even higher now.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, your customers are likely already using Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest to engage and communicate with their favorite businesses and brands. By beefing up your online presence, you can join the party and begin actively engaging with your customers. For example, you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/valentines-day-marketing-tips\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook to run contests tied into a holiday<\/a> or a company anniversary. You can also use social media to post industry news, tout new hires, and talk about exciting new product offerings. And, now that you&#8217;re blogging, you can use Facebook and Twitter to generate buzz for your blog posts. One more thing: Let&#8217;s not forget about those new reviews. You can maximize exposure for your positive testimonials by sharing these with your followers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Regardless of which marketing tactics you dive into first, the sky&#8217;s the limit when you put on your marketing hat.
