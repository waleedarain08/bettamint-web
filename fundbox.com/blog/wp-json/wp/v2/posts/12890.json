Eventually, those workers will have to return, perhaps as soon as early April, 2020, with the expectation that their offices are safe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even now, thousands of retailers across the U.S. are seeking cleaning services to disinfect their stores and help lessen customers&#8217; fears. Since the outbreak, ServiceChannel reports <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chainstoreage.com\/janitorial-services-stores-rise-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dramatic increases in requests for facilities services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by retailers so far in 2020, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Luxury retailers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; 84% increase in janitorial cleaning and carpet shampooing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Big-box retailers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; 35% increase in HVAC air filter cleanings and janitorial services<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Grocery stores<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; 18% increase in janitorial cleaning<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Restaurants<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; 53% average increase in cleaning, primarily in janitorial and kitchen<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add to this the sudden and huge demand in janitorial work orders at <\/span><b>healthcare-related offices\u00a0 (up 66%)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not to mention the upcoming unmeasurably-high need for residential cleaning services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A mission to serve, not just to grow<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own a janitorial, cleaning services, or facilities management company, this is a critical time to act. Beyond the obvious and unprecedented <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/grow-your-janitorial-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">opportunity for growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you&#8217;re on the front lines to help control a global pandemic. How is your business prepared to meet this demand\u2014and its many challenges\u2014right now? Here is a list of key steps and things to consider regarding the current and future services you provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Hire the right people<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even under the best circumstances, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.janitorialmanager.com\/blog\/hire-to-hire-janitorial-employees-rock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recruiting quality janitorial employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be one of the toughest aspects of your business. Unemployment in the cleaning industry is already at a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/taking-it-to-the-cleaners-coronavirus-spurs-spike-in-demand-for-jobs-to-sanitize-america-2020-03-12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record low of 2%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the candidate pool isn&#8217;t very large, according to Indeed Hiring Lab. Plus, these\u00a0 require more skill and may even involve technician licensing requirements. Here are some tips to help improve and speed your hiring process:<br \/>\n<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Mobile-friendly job listings.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> First, you should post easy-to-find openings on your website, which should ideally be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">optimized for mobile<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, since about 90% of people use smartphones to search. Google&#8217;s indexing algorithm penalizes websites that aren&#8217;t mobile-friendly, making them appear much lower in search results. Plus, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/research\/mobile-job-search\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glassdoor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that mobile-friendly can increase the number of job applicants by 11.6% compared to job listings that aren&#8217;t from other employers that aren\u2019t mobile-friendly.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Simplified job applications. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Glassdoor, &#8220;Lower-income workers complete job applications at lower rates and take longer to complete each application.&#8221; Using a mobile device makes this even worse, so asking them to self-describe their skills and education on an online form could deter many applicants. You may want to consider providing the option of simply attaching a resume.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Posting to job sites. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many popular websites like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, JobVite.com, LinkedIn.com, and Craigslist. However, many such sites require employers to pay fees as high as $999 per month.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Cleaning associations. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also try posting jobs on any cleaning associations you&#8217;re a member of (or consider joining), such as:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.issa.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ISSA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (The Worldwide Cleaning Association)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ijcsa.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IJCSA <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(International Janitorial Cleaning Services Association)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.icrassociation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (International Cleaning and Restoration Association)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nca-i.com\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NCA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (National Cleaners Association)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bscai.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BSCAI<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Building Service Contractors Association International)<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Offer incentives. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With competition high and applicant numbers low, you may find it helpful to stand out by offering incentives to attract quality people.

Purchase the best possible equipment and supplies<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combatting something as deadly serious as coronavirus demands not scrimping on the quality of the tools you use\u2014from disinfectants to application devices to personal protective gear for your employees. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Use only <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/prepare\/cleaning-disinfection.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>CDC approved or recommended procedures<\/b><\/a><b> and <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/pesticide-registration\/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>EPA registered hospital-grade disinfectants<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that kill bacteria and inactivate viruses.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Strictly follow <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.osha.gov\/SLTC\/covid-19\/standards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>current published OSHA standards<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for how infected materials are cleaned, disinfected, and properly disposed of as biohazard waste.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Provide OSHA-approved, <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.osha.gov\/SLTC\/personalprotectiveequipment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>fully encapsulated personal protective equipment (PPE)<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and full-face respirator masks, to be worn at all times by your certified cleanup technicians.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Develop and follow strict <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emergency-response-planning.com\/blog\/bid\/74836\/An-Expert-Guide-to-Demobilization-and-Post-Incident-Recovery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>demobilization processes<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your equipment, trucks and waste storage areas.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Consider high-tech equipment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

But of course, always follow recommended CDC and EPA guidelines.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Every cleaning is different in its details,&#8221; says <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bisnow.com\/national\/news\/property-management\/cleaning-commercial-properties-to-fight-covid-19-this-is-no-time-to-cheap-out-103420\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Biorisk Advisory Council<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Director of Forensic Operations, Jeff Jones. &#8220;But the essential process depends on three factors: the chemicals applied to the surfaces, the equipment used to apply them and whether personnel are properly trained to follow CDC guidelines.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Start marketing your services<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even at times of high demand, such as after natural disasters or during the coronavirus crisis, marketing is essential to your business success. Develop a marketing plan and invest in producing the materials you need to inform and be seen by the clients who require your help and to stand out from the competitors in your area\u2014especially those who may be cheaper and\/or less reputable than your own company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Have a plan. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A marketing plan doesn&#8217;t need to be extensive. However, such a plan can help focus your thoughts, efforts, and budget to help get the maximum results with minimum waste. Here is a quick guide on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizdaily.com\/how-to-write-a-marketing-plan-for-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to write a marketing plan for your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Know what makes you different.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Carefully consider your differentiators and your target market. Do you have expertise cleaning particular kinds of job sites, such as healthcare facilities, schools, factories, or residences? Craft your company mission statement and &#8220;elevator pitch&#8221; that&#8217;s clear, powerful, and consistent across your website messaging, advertising, and other marketing assets (brochures, flyers, social media).<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Create a target list. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know what geographic areas you can best serve? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, retail shops, restaurants, corporate offices, etc.)? Determining this ahead of time will help you better target your marketing and save money.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Get out into the community.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are many traditional ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/3-ways-brand-cleaning-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">build brand recognition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and raise awareness of your essential services. Consider new signage for your building or your service vehicles. Out-of-home advertising (such as billboards or bus shelter ads) can also promote your business on an automatic and ongoing basis. Consider radio or TV advertising to reach a larger audience. You may want to participate in business fairs and local chamber of commerce and networking events. Finally, door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Help with the cash flow you need to help<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We understand that the ramp up to preparing to meet such a demand for essential services can sometimes challenge your available cash on hand.
