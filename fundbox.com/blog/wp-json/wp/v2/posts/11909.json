There\u2019s also plenty of talk about the damage that can come as a side effect of the innovations which are designed to help society.<\/p>\n<p>In more recent years, the discussion has focused on the potential demise of the retail industry (and there are valid reasons why). Trends in retail have been raising some pressing questions among observers. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where does the retail industry stand?<\/li>\n<li>Where is the retail industry headed?<\/li>\n<li>What can small businesses do to stay in the race with the likes of Amazon?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll touch on all this just below, and clear up a bit of the confusion while we\u2019re at it.<\/p>\n<h2>Retail Today<\/h2>\n<p>Though the total number of retail stores closing in 2019 is estimated at over <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/stores-closing-this-year-2019-2\">4,000<\/a><\/span>, there are still companies that are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/slideshow\/15-retailers-are-opening-stores\/\">opening new branches<\/a><\/span>. Target, Costco, Whole Foods, and even Apple are still in the process of growing their number of physical locations. That doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a real concern in the physical retail market &#8211; there is.<\/p>\n<p>When numbers come out that show retail trade sales have risen by more than <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.census.gov\/retail\/marts\/www\/marts_current.pdf\">2%<\/a><\/span>\u00a0over the past year, it sounds like good news. In fact, the market value of retailing in the U.S. has risen by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">10.6%<\/span>\u00a0over the past three years, and is projected to continue its upward trajectory through 2020. Appears promising, right?<\/p>\n<p>Not exactly. So what\u2019s the catch?<\/p>\n<p>At the outset of 2019, retailers closed\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/coresight.com\/research\/us-store-closures-2019-outlook-no-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel\/\">23%<\/a><\/span>\u00a0more brick-and-mortar locations than they had at the beginning of 2018. Among the companies that plan on shutting down stores in 2019 are Sears, Gap, Macy\u2019s, and J.C. Penney. And if that doesn\u2019t strike you as problematic for retail store owners, then consider this: online retail sales have increased by more than\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/economics.cmail19.com\/t\/ViewEmail\/d\/22004D50545F6E152540EF23F30FEDED\/2A6E6DC8366E6655F1E87EB810D8F10A\">300<\/a> percent<\/span>\u00a0over the past 19 years.<\/p>\n<p>These patterns mean that retail store owners will need to learn how to integrate with the changes that are yet to come.<\/p>\n<h2>Retail Tomorrow<\/h2>\n<p>Evolving technology has brought with it the ability to shop online, and the growing demand to have everything connected and available at the touch of a button. Since the \u2018immediacy\u2019 side-effect is more predominant in younger generations, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that the future belongs to those younger groups of people.<\/p>\n<p>Today more than <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/2576\/us-millennials-internet-usage-and-online-shopping\/\">70 percent of Millennials<\/a><\/span>\u00a0have an Amazon Prime membership, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bain.com\/contentassets\/0b0b0e19099a448e83af2fb53a5630aa\/bain20media20pack_the_millennial_state_of_mind.pdf\">Bain &amp; Co.<\/a><\/span> estimates that by 2025, Millennials and Gen Z will make up 45 percent of the world\u2019s \u201cpersonal luxury goods market.\u201d This points to a future where online shopping is going to be an<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0even more <\/span>dominant force than it is now.<\/p>\n<p>These statistics shouldn\u2019t worry small retail business owners too much though, since Bain &amp; Co. also predicts that by 2025 roughly 75 percent of luxury goods purchases will still be made at a physical location. That simply means that consumers will want to see conveniences of advanced technology being incorporated into the \u2018physical\u2019 shopping experience.<\/p>\n<p>When people enter physical retail stores in the coming years, they\u2019ll encounter more examples of how technology is playing its role.<\/p>\n<p>These innovations are already present in stores that let customers use <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">online payment\u00a0solutions<\/span>\u00a0to make their purchases. More intriguing uses of technology are steadily being developed, including facial recognition technology that lets store associates know when another checkout line needs to be opened, and smartphone apps that allow you to see how furniture will fit in your home in augmented reality (AR).<\/p>\n<p>Although it\u2019s impossible to know for sure what the future will bring, there are ways to prepare&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Strategies\u00a0for Small Business Success in Retail<\/h2>\n<p>How can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">small retailers stay competitive<\/span>\u00a0with companies like Amazon and Alibaba? Here are 5 easy ways\u00a0to take advantage of being the \u2018underdog\u2019:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Build personal relationships with customers<\/h3>\n<p>Discounts and rewards are nice, but nothing has quite the same impact as offering stellar customer service. Go the extra mile to offer a product or service that best fits a customer\u2019s needs. Pay attention to what your customer says &#8211; use their name when corresponding to show that they truly matter. Corporations will often automate their customer service, so take advantage of your human-touch.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Find your niche<\/h3>\n<p>Having all of the products that one might need in a single location is a huge advantage for customers who are looking to purchase a lot of different things without having to bounce from store to store. However, when customers are looking for one specific product (let\u2019s say a top-notch wetsuit, for example), chances are they\u2019d rather take advice from an expert (like an experienced scuba diver) instead of someone working at Amazon or Walmart.<\/p>\n<p>If you find a niche and make your expertise clear, you\u2019ll command more authority within that niche. Specialize your business so that you can draw in customers by offering specific content and wisdom that they won\u2019t get from corporations.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Reach out to other small businesses<\/h3>\n<p>When the marketplace gets more competitive, small business owners often times work harder against one another. Instead, by establishing partnerships with other small businesses, it can become easier to stake your claim in your industry. See what sort of promotions or special deals can be worked out for the benefit of all participants. It will also help with earning a good reputation in the local community.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Show your personality<\/h3>\n<p>Big corporations will try to make themselves relatable to their customers, but how many people will feel a connection with carefully weighed slogans and stock photo advertisements? When it comes to being personable, the advantage clearly goes to small businesses who have a much easier time telling their unique story.<\/p>\n<p>Research has shown that customers who feel a connection with a business on a personal level are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2018\/02\/26\/lets-get-emotional-the-future-of-online-marketing\/#294270ed4d0c\">7 times more likely<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to purchase from that company. Don\u2019t underestimate the importance of showing your authentic self.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Move fast<\/h3>\n<p>Corporations put immense amounts of effort into perfecting their products and services, which is a big reason why those companies do so well. But, although every smart business owner should invest resources into optimizing their business plan, there\u2019s a huge advantage to small businesses who will find it easier to make changes along the way.<\/p>\n<p>If a corporation wants to change virtually any part of the business, there are tons of bureaucratic hoops that will need to be jumped through. When a small business wants to make a change, there are fewer people that need to be consulted, less paperwork, and so on. Use this benefit to find out what works for your business, and what doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing it up<\/h2>\n<p>While big corporations have the benefit of expendable resources, what they tend to focus on is ramping up the volume of sales. That leaves a lot of room for small business owners to make the most of the blind spots left over.<\/p>\n<p>Where corporations can feel like faceless logos, small businesses can actually put a face (and a personality) to the name.<\/p>\n<p>Where corporate retailers can cover a very broad range of goods, small businesses can specialize in a specific audience to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bring in more customers<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, while changes take loads of effort for corporations to put into effect, small businesses have the ability to make adjustments more easily.<\/p>\n<p>When you hear about \u2018technology\u2019 you think of smartphones and self-driving cars, but technology has had many more subtle yet profound impacts on the world of retail. Recent trends in the retail industry have shown a serious shift towards online shopping, along with the closing of thousands of physical retail locations.\u00a0These changes have left many business owners wondering how to compete and stand out.<\/p>\n<p>Challenges for small retail business owners are on the horizon, but there are steps that can be taken for them to keep their doors open. After all, it\u2019s not the size of the dog in the fight\u2014it\u2019s the size of the fight in the dog that matters. Only time will tell how the retail industry will persist in these times of change, so be sure to stay up-to-date with market trends on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-600 wp-image-11475\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ebook-RetailGrowth@2x-banner.png\" alt=\"Design Your Retail Marketing Growth Plan\" width=\"600\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ebook-RetailGrowth@2x-banner.png 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ebook-RetailGrowth@2x-banner-768x154.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Retail business owners, do you have your retail growth plan ready? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan\/\">Get our free ebook for fresh ideas and tips for designing your retail marketing growth plan.<\/a><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every day we hear about new advancements made in technology and how they\u2019re revolutionizing the world.
