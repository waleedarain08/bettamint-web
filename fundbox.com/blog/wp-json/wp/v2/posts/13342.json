Rethink your marketing strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To attract new customers and improve sales, start by revisiting your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, beginning with the budget. \u201cI recommend businesses spend anywhere from 2-8% of their budget on marketing,\u201d said Ken \u201cMr. Biz\u201d Wentworth, a business advisor and the owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mrbizsolutions.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Biz Solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to smart spending is determining which of your marketing strategies have the highest ROI. Ideally, \u201cyou should expect a 300% return for every dollar you spend,\u201d Wentworth said. \u201cTen thousand dollars spent should equal a $30K increase in revenue.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to review the cost and return of your marketing efforts at least once a quarter to see what worked and what didn\u2019t. Maybe you saw a high return from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email campaigns<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, but barely got a response from the mailers you sent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you find that $6K of the $10K you\u2019re spending doesn\u2019t help you make money, you can re-allocate that,\u201d Wentworth said.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your budget, you can re-allocate the money to one of your existing distribution channels <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use it to try a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-marketing-trends-to-know-in-the-new-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">popular marketing method<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like video. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/video-marketing-statistics-2020\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wyzowl\u2019s 2020 State of Video Marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> report, 84% of consumers said they bought a product or service after watching a brand\u2019s video.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPeople do business with folks they know, like, and trust,\u201d Wentworth said. \u201cThe easiest way for a customer to get to that place is to determine a bit of your personality and value offers by watching a video you put out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Cut costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trimming the fat in your business can give you more cash to put toward marketing or growth projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re cutting expenses the most important thing to do is make sure the cuts you\u2019re making aren\u2019t impacting your revenue pipeline,\u201d said Wentworth. Go through your expenses and assign a score to each one, he said: three points if it directly impacts company revenue, two points if it indirectly impacts revenue, and one point if it doesn\u2019t impact revenue at all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cExpense lines that score a five or six, I\u2019d stay clear of making reductions on those,\u201d Wentworth said. Instead, he recommended making 20-30% reductions on expenses that score in the mid-range, and 50-100% reductions on your lowest-scoring expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can cut costs on low-scoring expenses by switching to free <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/choose-right-small-business-accounting-solution\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wherever you can. \u201cThere are clever ways to get the same value for a need for much cheaper,\u201d said Kean Graham, the founder and CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.monetizemore.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MonetizeMore<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.waveapps.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have free business accounting services, while tools like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/en-US\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trello<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hootsuite.com\/plans\/free-offerings\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hootsuite<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer free project management platforms and social media scheduling, respectively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Bring value to customers\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding creative ways to bring value to potential customers can help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/agency-grows-thru-fundbox-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure new business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Consider what you can offer beyond your products and services, whether it\u2019s a niche podcast, how-to video, free ebook, or infographic that sheds light on a confusing topic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog posts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that cater to your audience\u2019s needs are a great place to start, Graham said. \u201cPeople search on Google how to do things. That is how they will find your blog and eventually sign up for your offering.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-surefire-ways-grow-your-cleaning-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">janitorial business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, you could write a blog post with deep cleaning tips or step-by-step instructions for getting rid of common stains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to bring value is by acting as a resource. \u201cWe answer ad optimization-related questions on Google Product Forums, Quora, Twitter, and Reddit,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe have found that this enables positive interactivity with sub-communities, establishes us as authorities, and drives many qualified leads [to our site].\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Emphasize customer reviews and referrals\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gathering customer reviews and referrals is one of the best ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expand your customer base<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to BrightLocal\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 Local Consumer Review Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 82% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses, and 91% of consumers said positive reviews make them more likely to use that business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt goes back to \u2018know, like and trust.\u2019 If someone a customer knows, likes, and trusts recommends my business, then that new customer feels good about it,\u201d Wentworth said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider posting on social media or sending an email to customers thanking them for their business and asking them to write an online review. You can also incentivize customers or clients to refer you to their friends and family by offering future discounts on products or services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just make sure you actually read and respond to the feedback you receive, though. According to the survey above, 71% of consumers said they\u2019re more likely to use a business that responds to its reviews. Take the time to thank customers for their comments and address negative feedback in a polite, constructive way.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Build relationships with other businesses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing relationships with other businesses can help you generate buzz, discover new potential customers, and increase revenue.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forming strategic partnerships is helpful, Graham said. \u201cWe have successfully set up partnerships with companies like Google and WP Engine, which have sent valuable <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traffic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> [to our site] on a consistent basis.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also collaborate with businesses for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-event-marketing-strategies-grow-business-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">events<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fundraisers, and cross-promotions. If you sell specialty bath products online, for instance, you could team up with an at-home massage service to offer customers product bundles and discounted spa treatments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business relationships are a great way to tap into new markets <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make your current customers feel valued.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing your business on a tight budget may seem daunting, but it\u2019s doable. Learning how to market strategically, cut costs, and nurture customer relationships can set you up for long-term success.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide financial, legal or accounting advice.
