Despite this, banks do offer small business certain services and benefits that are still worth considering:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accessibility <\/strong><br \/>\nBanks are still more prevalent on the ground compared to credit unions (whose mission is to serve local communities).

Be warned though, thanks to consolidation and the decline of one-to-one relationships, banks today tend to focus solely on credit history when assessing the loan-worthiness of small businesses. So if your credit score isn\u2019t great (below the 600-650 range), don\u2019t even thinking about applying for a loan through your bank.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Familiarity<\/strong><br \/>\nPeople don\u2019t like change. If you\u2019ve been banking with one financial institution for years, the thought of moving all your money somewhere else might not appeal. Or perhaps you have a great relationship with your local community bank that you don\u2019t want to lose.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t bury your head in the sand though, if you know that a credit union can offer better rates or services, talk to your bank and see what they can do for you. They may be more flexible thank you think, especially if you bank with a community bank as opposed to a \u201cbig bank.\u201d Read more about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/savings\/community-vs-big-banks.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Community Banks vs. Big Banks<\/a> from Bankrate.com.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weigh up the Pros and Cons<\/strong><br \/>\nCredit union or bank \u2013 which is right for your business?
