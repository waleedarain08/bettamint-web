By definition, they tend to be people who prefer independence over a corporate environment. They don&#8217;t want to be tied to a desk\u2014they&#8217;d rather have the solo freedom of being on-the-go!<\/p>\n<p>While there&#8217;s some pushback to the idea of doing too much on your phone, don&#8217;t forget there was once pushback to using fax machines. Some argue that it isn&#8217;t practical to handle tasks on a mobile device, and yes, that may be true of a few specific, complex projects. However, in many cases, mobile adoption and new mobile applications are helping small business owners get more done\u2014no desk time required.<\/p>\n<p>A few years back, AT&amp;T published a study showing that <a href=\"http:\/\/about.att.com\/mediakit\/2013techpoll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">66% of small businesses could not survive\u2014or it would be a major challenge to survive\u2014without wireless technologies<\/a>. We believe this percentage will only continue to increase as more small business-centric mobile applications are developed.<\/p>\n<p>Every day, small business owners are already using phones and tablets to move their businesses forward. Here are a few examples:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Email<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This one goes without saying. Checking your emails while away from your desk improves your productivity\u2014and at the very least, you can triage emails into delete\/forward\/quick reply\/save for later. Try using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/outlook-com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft Outlook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/mail\/help\/mobile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gmail<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getboxer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taskbox Boxer<\/a> are three email apps to check out.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2.

SMS\/Messaging<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For better or worse, we respond to text messages much more promptly than we do email. When there is a fire to put out, you can expect a call first, quickly followed by a text. Apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whatsapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WhatsApp<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skype.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skype<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack<\/a> are also popular for timely responses and flash collaboration<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4.
