According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fedsmallbusiness.org\/medialibrary\/fedsmallbusiness\/files\/2019\/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 Small Business Credit Survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 56% of small businesses have sought financing to expand or pursue an opportunity. Extra cash can give you the freedom to generate ideas, experiment with marketing tactics, and take risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding and credit are essential to tapping growth opportunities,\u201d said Ted Chan, the CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caredash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CareDash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an online healthcare review directory. \u201cMarkets innovate very quickly now\u2014whether it&#8217;s debt or equity, funding can launch a new product or service line to capture fast-moving opportunities.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business lines of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are particularly flexible. Unlike a term loan, which gives you a lump sum of cash, a line of credit is revolving. You can tap into your funds on an ongoing basis and use them repeatedly as long as you bring your balance back down to zero.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to step up your game? Here are five ways you can use funding to edge out your competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Develop a new product or service<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing a unique product or service can help you attract new customers and increase revenue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the best ways to stay competitive in any field is to stay on top of the trends and always put your customer&#8217;s needs and wants first,\u201d said Lydia McConnell, the founder and creative director of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lechicmiami.store\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Le Chic Miami<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a shop that sells handmade jewelry. \u201cWhat would your customers benefit from the most? How can you make the best possible experience for them?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For McConnell, that means gathering feedback from customers on their favorite jewelry styles, then experimenting with designs, colors, and concepts. For other businesses, catering to customers\u2019 needs might require conducting market research, adding new features to current products, or investing in a unique platform or offering.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe used our line of credit to build out our core product, the CareDash healthcare directory,\u201d said Chan. \u201cStaying ahead of the curve on key trends like the consumerization of healthcare, telemedicine, and value-based care is essential to the growth of our business.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Improve production and increase output<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can\u2019t compete with larger companies on price, try competing on output. Using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/use-first-business-loan-effectively\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to streamline your production process can help you take on more work and grow your business quicker.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When McConnell used a line of credit to purchase a laser cutting machine for her studio, she was able to process larger orders. \u201cBefore, when I was using a laser cutter at a local Makerspace I could only use their machine two hours a day.\u201d Full-time access to such an efficient tool also helped McConnell improve the quality of her products. \u201cIt has really allowed me to create complex shapes and more intricate designs,\u201d she said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider which areas of your business\u2019s production process are slow or outdated. If, for example, you struggle with organizing inventory or boxing items quickly, you could use a line of credit to purchase inventory management software or buy packaging equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Meet increased demand<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether or not your business operates seasonally, there are certain times of the year when you need to respond to a surge in demand. \u201cWe always want to have our most popular things in stock during the big season,\u201d Munson said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you cover upfront costs in raw materials, labor, production, and storage. Or, if you run a service-based business you could use a temporary cash infusion to hire seasonal employees or contractors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe use our line of credit in August or September and start producing an extra 10-15% of product each month to prepare for the holidays,\u201d Munson said. \u201cWe have to buy a lot of leather and pay for the labor without the sales, but once the sales come in they far outweigh the interest on the line of credit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s crucial to have enough resources to cater to customers when demand spikes; businesses that do are more likely to see repeat customers and benefit from referrals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Invest in marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s tempting to cut your business\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when cash is tight, but consistent marketing can be critical to expanding your customer base. A line of credit can give you the financial cushion to adopt a new marketing strategy or try a different distribution method.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your content marketing consists mostly of articles and blog posts, for example, you may want to explore videos and infographics. Or maybe you want to double-down on strategies with a proven ROI, like email campaigns and social media ads.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding can also give you the freedom to rethink your approach to finding and retaining customers. Chan said his company employs judo strategy, which involves responding quickly to market changes and adding new features to their products before their competitors can. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We then market these features aggressively as differentiating points.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Capitalize on growth opportunities<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking advantage of growth opportunities can set you up for long-term success, but you need the funds to act fast. A line of credit can provide the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> necessary to acquire a smaller competitor, relocate to a busier side of town, or bid on a large project.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Munson, the opportunity came when his clients began asking him to manufacture for them. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had to hire people for a few months and pay for their salaries and their training, on top of trying to grow the company and continue with inventory,\u201d he said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the upfront expenses, the work came with long-term benefits. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe more I can grow the factory, the more it distributes the fixed costs of the factory and makes us more competitive in our pricing,\u201d Munson said.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get ahead of the game<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying ahead of the competition is essential to your business\u2019s longevity and financial stability.
