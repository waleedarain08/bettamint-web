Don\u2019t Make These Mistakes"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>More people are creating side hustles while employed. In America, for instance, according to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/\">Bankrate<\/a><\/span>, there are 44 million people who have a second job, also known as a &#8220;side hustle.&#8221; These numbers are only set to increase as many realize the power of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/whatis.techtarget.com\/definition\/gig-economy\">gig economy<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>For many people a side hustle is a mere stepping stone to a more permanent escape from \u201cthe cubicle\u201d. They have their sights set on full-time self-employment. If you\u2019re in this boat, it\u2019s even more important to run your side hustle with focus. After all, this is the time when you still have a safety net in place\u2026 so make the most of this time to set yourself up for ultimate success.<\/p>\n<p>Here are our top 3 mistakes to avoid when scaling your side hustle:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Underselling Your Side Hustle Skills<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many adopt an \u201cIt\u2019s all gravy\u201d attitude while running their side gig, and hold back from negotiating the highest possible rates with your clients. It\u2019s easy to fall into this trap. But you\u2019re not doing yourself or your industry any favors. By setting or accepting lower rates, you create the perception that these are the going rates in the industry, making it harder for other professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, if you ever decide to turn that side hustle into a full-time gig, you\u2019re going to have to deal with a \u201creality bites\u201d rate adjustment to make ends meet!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Solution:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Realize that even though you\u2019re running a side hustle, you can and should set higher rates. Research what the going rates are in the industry and price accordingly (reach out to other professionals in your field to see what they charge).<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re scared of setting higher rates, it may be because you lack confidence, but it may also be because you don\u2019t truly understand the value you\u2019re providing. So, get clear on that value (read the book\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/breakingthetimebarrier\">Breaking the Time Barrier<\/a><\/span>; it\u2019s changed how I view my business).<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Not Separating Business and Personal Finances<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re running a side hustle, it\u2019s understandable to use your personal bank accounts. After all, you may be \u201ctesting the waters\u201d and not want the hassle of setting up business accounts. But, if you\u2019re increasingly thinking about turning it into a full-time job, you really want to keep finances separate.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, you\u2019ll continuously be sifting through bank statement to determine your earnings and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/personal-business-finances\">separating business expenses from personal ones<\/a><\/span>. Let\u2019s not forget about the actual impact this has on your business by not knowing where all your money is going.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Solution:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Spend some time researching the best small business account you can get. Think about the fees associated with transfers to your personal accounts (because for now, that will be your main transaction). But think about how this account can scale with your business too.<\/p>\n<p>As more and more businesses take their transactions online, account fees will also be worth considering.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Tracking Income and Sending Invoices the Wrong Way<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Tracking your income correctly is just as crucial for determining your profitability as expense tracking is. Your inclination may be to use what\u2019s familiar (for example, Word or Excel). But there are drawbacks: You spend an awfully long time manually reconciling all the data and don\u2019t have a firm grasp on your income situation. Plus, maintaining accuracy can be a huge challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Dare I mention the old proverb coined by Benjamin Franklin in 1748 that says \u201cTime is Money\u201d? I think so. Time really is money! Because it\u2019s such a valuable resource, we should make an effort to use it wisely. And so, while Excel may seem like the cheaper option, it\u2019s really just a time-suck. There is a better way to track income and send invoices.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Solution:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Invoicing and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/perfect-accounting-software-ebook\">accounting has come a long way<\/a><\/span>\u2026 like so many things there are handy solutions that live on the cloud.
