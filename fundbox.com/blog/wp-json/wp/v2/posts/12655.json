It&#8217;s bold, optimistic, and full of energy, inspired by the initiative, focus, and momentum of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>You can see this in action on the product dashboard and on our website, with bright colors, black and white photography of real business owners, and clean design. We\u2019ve also incorporated dynamic brushstrokes, representing energy and forward movement\u2014inspired by the determination we see our customers bring to their businesses, and the passion that our employees bring to work every day.<\/p>\n<p>We worked with <a href=\"https:\/\/design.studio\/\">DesignStudio<\/a>, alongside our internal design team, in a yearlong collaborative process to bring this new brand to life. Beginning with a deep dive into our history, our customers, case studies, product roadmap, and aspirations, we incorporated hundreds of real Fundbox stories into what became our new brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Our principles<\/h2>\n<p>We express our brand principles by always striving to be transparent, direct, and focused on the future. You\u2019ll always know where you stand with us, and we\u2019ll do our best to communicate clearly. We exist to empower our customers, helping them achieve their business goals. The way we communicate is part of that.<\/p>\n<h2>Our logo<\/h2>\n<p>Our new logo is confident, energetic, and expresses the movement element of our brand. The logotype is accessible and friendly, and we emphasize the word \u201cFund\u201d with an expressive stroke, to clearly communicate how we help businesses.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12661\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/LogoShowcase@2x.gif\" alt=\"Fundbox logo animation\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Typography<\/h2>\n<p>Our primary typeface is Roobert, a geometric, sans-serif font family. The type contains some distinctive features, like the rounded corner of the \u201cG\u201d and some quirky punctuation marks. We\u2019re drawn to these unique details coupled with the boldness and strong legibility of the type in print and onscreen.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12664\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/TypographyShowcase@2x.png\" alt=\"Fundbox typography Roobert\" width=\"600\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/TypographyShowcase@2x.png 1320w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/TypographyShowcase@2x-768x233.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We use type in black or white, to emphasize ease of reading. This is important to us because directness and transparency are two of our most important goals with any of our communications.<\/p>\n<h2>Color palette<\/h2>\n<p>We use a dynamic color palette, consisting of ten brand colors, plus black and white. We use both light and dark versions of blue, orange, coral, sand, and pink in tonal combinations.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12660\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ColorsSystem@2x.png\" alt=\"Fundbox brand colors 2019\" width=\"600\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ColorsSystem@2x.png 1320w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/ColorsSystem@2x-768x256.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12662\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/LogosinColors@2x.png\" alt=\"Fundbox logos and colors\" width=\"601\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/LogosinColors@2x.png 1320w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/LogosinColors@2x-768x446.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This departure from our previous visual identity signals a few things. The colors are bright, striking, and fearless with an element of fun. While ten may sound like a lot of brand colors, we use them in well-defined ways within a cohesive design system, ensuring that the effect is clear while remaining flexible.<\/p>\n<h2>Visual direction<\/h2>\n<p>Our photography uses a documentary style, showing real people in diverse types of work environments. With this photography, we aim to expand the idea of what a successful business owner looks like. We use black and white imagery, to give photographs a quality of permanence and weight, recalling the look of film and celebrating the focus, grit, and dignity of business owners. We tell stories about courageous entrepreneurs in action and motion.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12663\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/PhotographyShowcase@2x.jpg\" alt=\"Fundbox art direction 2019\" width=\"600\" height=\"625\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An important part of our visual direction is the use of thick brushstrokes. Inspired by the passionate, in-the-moment, free-hand markings of entrepreneurs in the midst of their work, these expressive strokes are the determined, progress-focused emphasis marks drawn in business meetings, on blueprints, or on drafts. The marks connect us with the feeling of being in the zone, working with focus and determination to create something new.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12659\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/BrushesShowcase@2x.png\" alt=\"Fundbox brand expressions\" width=\"601\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/BrushesShowcase@2x.png 1320w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/BrushesShowcase@2x-768x375.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12658\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/BigadsShowcase@2x.jpg\" alt=\"Fundbox brand ads\" width=\"600\" height=\"630\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Looking forward<\/h2>\n<p>Over the past year, we\u2019ve made an effort to consider and improve every aspect of our brand, from the inside out.
