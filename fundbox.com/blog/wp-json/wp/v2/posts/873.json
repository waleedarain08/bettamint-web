Open new doors and generate new revenue streams by taking your business on the road to fairs, events, festivals, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile card readers aren\u2019t just great for retailers. Contractors and other service businesses can also use card readers to accept money on-site and end the hassle of billing a client or waiting for a check to process.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in the food service business, mobile card readers let you take the point of sale directly to the customer right at their table, making \u201cgetting the check\u201d so much easier.<\/p>\n<p>And, if that\u2019s not reason enough, take a look inside your customer\u2019s wallets and you\u2019ll find that the use of cash is declining in favor of plastic. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/consumer-index\/financial-security-index-cashs-cachet.aspx\">Bankrate survey<\/a> found that more than two-thirds of consumers carry only $50 in their wallets while 40% carry less than $20.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the Costs?<\/strong><br \/>\nOf course, accepting credit cards isn\u2019t free and many small businesses are reluctant to pay the high fees associated with merchant accounts. The good news is that mobile POS systems simplify and cut the costs of accepting credit cards \u2013 making them an ideal solution for smaller businesses. You don\u2019t need a lot of hardware, just a tablet or mobile device and the card reader itself (which is free).<\/p>\n<p>If you already have a merchant account or a relationship with a credit card processing company you can probably start accepting payments right away, although you may be charged a set-up fee.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to forego the traditional route and go with a service like Square, many of the fees associated with credit card transactions (set-up, refunds, etc.) are waived. Instead you pay a flat-rate 2.75% fee per swipe and funds are deposited within one to two business days. Get more info on Square pricing <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/pricing\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/payments.intuit.com\/mobile-credit-card-processing\/\">Intuit GoPayment\u2019s pricing structure<\/a> is slightly different. There\u2019s a pay-as-you-go plan for 2.4% + 25c per swipe for less than $3k per month or you can sign-up for a monthly plan and pay a flat $19.95 per month and 1.75% + 25c per swipe. As an added bonus, all transactions synch with QuickBooks and Intuit Point of Sale products.<\/p>\n<p>The cheapest of the big three players is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/us\/webapps\/mpp\/credit-card-reader-how-to#faqs\">PayPal Here<\/a> with a 2.7% swipe fee, no hidden charges or long-term commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/6369-mobile-credit-card-processing-costs.html\">Mobile Credit Card Pricing and Processing Fees<\/a> from Business News Daily.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How Secure are Mobile Card Readers?<\/strong><br \/>\nGoPayment, Square and PayPal Here are serious about card protection and adhere to PCI Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) which means that consumer credit card data can\u2019t be stored on the device. Readers are also encrypted and other security and fraud features provide for a layered security approach. <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/security\">Square is very open about its security practices<\/a> (having hit the headlines early on for launching an un-encrypted card reader \u2013 now fixed).<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, mobile payment services are as secure as regular credit card processing stations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How Do I Choose?<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re already a QuickBooks user, then\u00a0GoPayment with its seamless integration with QuickBooks is well worth considering. Its flexible pricing options also fit well with the needs of high-volume sales and the serious business user.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for an out-of-the-box no-frills approach to mobile point of sale, consider Square. It\u2019s also a good fit for small business owners who don\u2019t want to be locked into a commitment \u2013 no contract, no merchant account, just pay-as-you-go and avoid a whole host of fees. It\u2019s also easy to use and makes the actual credit card transaction quick and easy for you and your customers.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Here\u2019s strongest advantage is its pricing \u2013 2.70% per swipe \u2013 less than both Square and GoPayment. It\u2019s also backed by the power of PayPal\u2019s extensive support network. And, as a nice marketing touch, it also includes a GPS device that lets mobile users pinpoint businesses who accept PayPal Here or PayPal.<\/p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison of the three top players and others, including Wells Fargo PayAnywhere reader and Amazon Local Register, read: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/square-vs-intuit-gopayment-vs-paypal-here-mobile-credit-card-processors\/\">Which Mobile Credit Card Reader is Right for You: 7 Major Services Compared<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, before you decide, don\u2019t forget to talk to your accountant so that you have a clear view of how a mobile payment platform will fit into your cash flow management processes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While cyber security remains a concern (according to eBay\u2019s 2014 Holiday Retail Audit, 65% of retailers are worried about a &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":876,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10147],"yst_prominent_words":[4327,4322,3068,4329,4325,4320,739,724,4321,4330,771,4326,4317,4324,4318,4323,4319,4331,3904,4328],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Should Your Business Accept Mobile Payments? - Fundbox","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Are you considering a Mobile Payment or POS platform for your business?
