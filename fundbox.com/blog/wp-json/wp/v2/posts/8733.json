Jared Hecht does. Hecht is the co-founder and CEO of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/\">Fundera<\/a><\/span>, an online marketplace that connects small business owners and entrepreneurs with the country\u2019s leading small business lenders. His mission? \u201cTo give small businesses an equal opportunity to achieve financial success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Hecht started Fundera in 2014, his motivation was personal. His cousin couldn\u2019t get funding, even though he already owned a successful business. They turned to Google, Hecht recalls, and couldn\u2019t find the financial information they needed. Fundera was born from the need to educate and simplify the lending process. With Fundera\u2019s free service, business owners can submit one application and can receive competing offers from various lenders willing to provide funding.<\/p>\n<p>As part of our interview series on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The State of Small Business Lending<\/span>, we talked to Hecht about the future of online lending and how he sees Fundera\u2019s role in shaping that industry.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8734\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8734\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-8734\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/81276573-217d-4b53-9125-bec096eb0110_jared20headshot201.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Hecht, CEO of Fundera\" width=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/81276573-217d-4b53-9125-bec096eb0110_jared20headshot201.jpg 1056w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/81276573-217d-4b53-9125-bec096eb0110_jared20headshot201-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jared Hecht, Co-Founder and CEO of Fundera<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fundbox: Since you launched Fundera, what have you learned about the type of lending experience small business owners need? How has the platform changed over time to meet those needs? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: You have to build a good customer experience. We learn by talking to our customers. You can measure whether you\u2019re providing a good experience to your customers by looking at your growth trajectory over time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We\u2019ve learned a lot. At the beginning we made assumptions that [small business owners] wanted to talk to someone [an advisor]. But we realized not everyone wanted to [have that conversation]. Small business owners are busy, time strapped, and bombarded with cold calls and spam email. The last thing they want is to have their time wasted.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Time and capital are the scarcest resources small business owners have. And small business owners want a high degree of certainty as quickly as possible in a frictionless way and they want to know the partner they\u2019re working with has their best interests at heart.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Have you had to change the customer experience to meet the needs of millennials?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: When we started, the willingness of people to provide their social security or tax ID numbers on a web interface was about 10%. Their ability to connect their bank accounts was about 10%, as well. Now, over 33% will connect their bank accounts and will do it immediately. Is that millennials, or are people just becoming more comfortable with web apps in general?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How does Fundera approach lending differently from others in the industry? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: We see the world differently\u2014we have a different philosophy and approach. From day one\u2014before we incorporated the business\u2014we were writing content. It\u2019s one of the pillars (along with providing great technology) that the business is built on. It gives us a competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fundera is also quite active on social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: We want to be a hub and source of truth and have made a significant investment in social media. We engage [on social platforms]; we answer questions. We try to get ahead of the questions they\u2019re going to ask.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This isn\u2019t your first entrepreneurial endeavor. What did you learn from your experience at your previous company, GroupMe, that you\u2019ve applied at Fundera?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: I\u2019ve applied what I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">didn\u2019t<\/span>\u00a0get to experience at GroupMe. At GroupMe, we had a fun product and brand. But we didn\u2019t turn it into a business. We had 20 employees when we sold it\u2014and we weren\u2019t generating any revenue.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">This helped me set a personal challenge for myself. I wanted to wanted to steepen my learning curve and create a company that could have a transformative impact on the industry. And I wanted to build a company that played a meaningful part in our employees\u2019 lives and catalyzed their professional growth.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I also learned it\u2019s okay to fail. For every 10 things we released, only three worked. You need to rapidly put things out there and see what sticks. And what works we adapt broadly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8739\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Fundera-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"Fundera quote: a hyper-customer-centric experience\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Is company culture important? How do you maintain a positive workplace culture at Fundera&#8217;s current growth stage, and as you aggressively build out your team? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: I\u2019m willing to admit there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to make mistakes\u2014and that\u2019s okay, as long as we course correct quickly.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It\u2019s important to be clear about our vision and mission. And we communicate that to the whole company (about 60 employees) on a regular basis. Our culture is tied into where ultimately we want to go as a company\u2014to have a mission-driven culture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We want to do right by small business owners. To create a hyper-customer-centric experience. It\u2019s important to write down your values. It\u2019s not my job to tell everyone how to do it, however. I write it down and share [the values] with everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We\u2019re an open book internally, with our people, and externally. We hold monthly town halls; send a weekly email that shares our goals, so people can make informed decisions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It\u2019s not just about selling products. We want to be the financial advisor that most small business owners don\u2019t have and can\u2019t afford.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Why should small business owners turn to Fundera and not traditional lenders?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: If you\u2019re a lender you don\u2019t have objectivity. Your goal is to sell money. We will never be a lender. [Providing] an objective voice helps small business owners understand the financial options out there. That gives us a leg up on lenders.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What do you expect to change over the next few years as you grow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: It\u2019s going to get harder from here on out. And I know I\u2019ll never be fully prepared for it. We don\u2019t know a lot of things, and we need to be humble and learn them. But, we have a great board of directors and advisors, and we hire great people who elevate our game.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Is this the direction the lending industry is shifting?\u00a0Will millennials cause a shift?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: It\u2019s not necessarily millennials. It\u2019s what the internet does to stuff. This is what the internet does to industries. It transfers power from sellers to buyers. It takes opaque industries and makes them transparent.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What are the biggest obstacles for small business owners seeking capital?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: Knowledge. Business owners need a keen sense of what they\u2019re looking for and what they\u2019re eligible for\u2014and need to be able to navigate to that solution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Our biggest competition is the notion of indifference. Will entrepreneurs respond to ads that try to sell them something that\u2019s not right for them, because they don\u2019t have time to learn more? Or because they\u2019re just being reactive?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">You say small business owners need more education. What specifically do they need right now to make the right financial decisions? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: They need to know what the problem is they\u2019re looking to solve\u2014and within what time frame they need to solve it. They need to think about: What am I eligible for? How do I know I\u2019m getting the right product? Do I have debt? Is it the right kind of debt?<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">If they\u2019re not eligible, they need to know why and how to fix it. They need to understand creditworthiness. They need a plan so they can get to eligibility.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Where do you see Fintech companies driving new business models that have caught traditional lenders off guard?\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: At first, traditional banks said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d When customers started going to online lenders, they weren\u2019t necessarily customers of banks. Now, it\u2019s a wake-up call because other companies, such as PayPal are getting into the lending business\u2014and they have the same competitive advantage banks have, including a large base of customers and a very low cost of capital.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Companies like Amazon have access to all the capital in the world. They don\u2019t need to wait for small business owners to come to them. They can proactively go to them.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0ultimate goal?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">JH: Like our mission says, we want to build products to help entrepreneurs secure the best financial solutions available\u2026to take the stress out of [their] day-to-day, enabling [them] to grow. Our message to small business owners and entrepreneurs is, \u201cIt\u2019s time you got the trusted advisor you\u2019ve always deserved.\u201d What we do is important. We are building a service to empower small business owners.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">About Jared Hecht:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jaredhecht\/\">Jared Hecht<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is the CEO of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fundera.com\">Fundera<\/a><\/span>, a small business lending marketplace that allows small business owners we search for and apply for multiple loan options with a single application.
