The COVID-19 pandemic has created historic disruption and challenges for small business owners. While government legislation, such as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/policy-issues\/cares\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has provided a much-needed financial lifeline for small businesses, many of its tax provisions end or require action by December 31, 2020.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business owners need to act fast. To help you navigate this complex landscape, here are some key strategies, facts, and often overlooked tax deductions to be aware of as you get into year-end tax planning mode.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Revisit your estimated tax payments for a potential shortfall<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses experienced cash flow issues in 2020 and underpaid their estimated taxes. Doing so could result in a penalty from the IRS and your state government. Revisit your estimated tax payments for the year and see if there\u2019s a shortfall based on your anticipated year-end income. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use IRS\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f2210.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 2210, Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals, Estates, and Trust<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">see if you owe a penalty for underpaying your estimated tax. If you do, talk to a tax professional to understand your options and determine if you qualify for an IRS waiver based on your circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Accelerate your AMT credit refund<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CARES Act included a provision that accelerated when and how businesses can claim unused Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 2017 Tax and Jobs Act eliminated AMT for future tax years but allows businesses to claim any unused AMT credits in tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. However, the CARES Act expedited the refund process so you can now claim any remaining credits in the 2020 tax year. This money can then be injected back into your business to aid cash flow or pay operating expenses. To claim a refund for any unused AMT credits (prior to tax year 2018), file IRS <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/temporary-procedures-to-fax-certain-forms-1139-and-1045-due-to-covid-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 1139<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1045.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 1045<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by December 31, 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Have a conversation about the COVID-related payroll tax deferment\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another benefit of the CARES Act is that it allows employers to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/deferral-of-employment-tax-deposits-and-payments-through-december-31-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defer payment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of their share of 2020 payroll taxes. Deferred amounts must be paid by December 31, 2021, by which time 50% is due with the remaining 50% due by December 31, 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the deferment was intended to provide much-needed liquidity for the remainder of 2020, it also means that business owners can\u2019t deduct their share of payroll taxes until they are paid. This may not be an issue, but it\u2019s an important conversation to have with a tax advisor who may advise you to pay back your share of the payroll tax early so that you can claim the deduction for 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/coronavirus-tax-relief-for-businesses-and-tax-exempt-entities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coronavirus Tax Relief for Businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and how these may impact your 2020 tax year filing preparations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Running your business from home? Take advantage of the home office deduction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate a small business out of your home, you may be overlooking a common tax deduction. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), before COVID about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.advocacy.sba.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/24153946\/Frequently-Asked-Questions-Small-Business-2019-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50% of all firms were home-based<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Yet, the IRS <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/for-small-business-week-irs-offers-tips-to-small-business-owners-about-the-overlooked-home-office-deduction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reports<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the deduction is often overlooked by small business owners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are one of the millions of business owners, freelancers, and independent contractors now working from home to stay safe and maintain social distancing, be sure you\u2019re familiar with the nuances of this deduction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home office deduction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? If you rent or own your home and use part of the property for business, you may be able to deduct business expenses associated with your office space such as rent, mortgage interest, property taxes, and utilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To encourage business owners to claim the deduction, the IRS offers two methods for calculating the deduction\u2014the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/simplified-option-for-home-office-deduction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">simplified option<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the regular method. The simplified option lets you deduct $5 per square feet of the home used for business with a maximum deduction of $1,500. The regular method is a little more time consuming and involves determining the expenses of your home office based on the percentage of your home devoted to business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there are caveats. To claim the deduction, your home must be your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">principal<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> place of business and you must use a certain area of your home <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exclusively<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for business. For example, if you work from a laptop on your kitchen table but also use that space for family mealtimes, you can\u2019t claim the deduction since you aren\u2019t using that space \u201cexclusively\u201d as a home office. However, if you use a separate room or office solely and regularly for business purposes \u2013 be sure to claim this important deduction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax season isn\u2019t here yet, but you can prepare now by researching which expenses you can deduct, gather records of your home expenses for the year, and determine which method is best for you (a good conversation to have with your tax advisor). Refer to the IRS guide\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-publication-587\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business Use of Your Home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 for guidance on how to figure out and claim your deduction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Write off your home office purchases<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you found yourself suddenly operating your small business from home this year, then you probably spent some cash to equip it. Many of these costs can be written off\u2014if they are used exclusively for business purposes. This includes office furniture, computers, printers, office supplies, and even software licenses. Plus, if you drive to the store to make those purchases exclusively, you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/tax-professionals\/standard-mileage-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deduct the mileage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> incurred.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need any office equipment or furnishings, you might want to purchase those before the end of 2020 as you may be able to use these purchases as a tax deduction this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conduct an audit now of all your purchases in 2020 so that you have the information you need before you complete IRS <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-access\/f4562_accessible.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 4562<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and attach it to your tax return.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. If you borrowed funds, deduct the interest<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business accessed financing during 2020, such as a loan or business line of credit, you may be able to deduct interest payments on the funds you borrowed. For example, if you used a line of credit to purchase equipment or inventory or to fund payroll, the interest would be considered an \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d business expense by the IRS.

Decide whether you should defer income<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to reduce your tax liability and preserve cash flow? If you\u2019re a service-based small business and you can defer income until next year by invoicing after December 31. Obviously, you\u2019ll have to pay that tax eventually, but if you need to reduce your estimated tax payments this year, it\u2019s something to consider. Don\u2019t forget, however, that deferring income this year could push you into a higher tax bracket next year. If you\u2019d rather absorb the tax liability now, invoice early and as soon as a project is complete, rather than waiting till the end of the month so that you can declare the income in the 2020 tax year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Max out your retirement plan contributions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re self-employed and have an IRA or simplified employee pension (SEP) you have until Tax Day 2021 to make contributions, but maxing out your contributions before December 31 will lower your taxable income for the year. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-iras-contributions#:~:text=How%20much%20can%20I%20contribute,re%20age%2050%20or%20older.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximum contribution for an IRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2020 is $6,000 (plus an extra $1,000 if you are aged 50+) and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people#:~:text=Simplified%20Employee%20Pension%20(SEP),2020%20and%20%2456%2C000%20for%202019).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$57,000<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a SEP plan (or 25% of your net earnings from self-employment).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Act now, don\u2019t delay<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 has been a challenging year, but don\u2019t delay these important year-end tax planning considerations. Not all will apply to your business, but those that do can have an impact on your bottom line and position you to better navigate tax season when it arrives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide financial, legal or accounting advice.
