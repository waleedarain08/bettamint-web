Include a company description<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, you can dive into your company\u2019s background, history, and structure. In addition to sharing basic information like your company\u2019s origin story, location, and size, make sure you explain how your company has grown or changed over the years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also add details about your business\u2019s legal and ownership structures, your company culture and values, and your current employees or hiring needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Add a market analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A market analysis\u2014or in-depth breakdown of your business\u2019s viability and profit potential\u2014is a critical component of any well-written <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/2-easy-ways-to-make-business-planning-enjoyable-and-productive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Make sure you gather relevant, up-to-date research and statistics to illustrate your findings, and consider breaking up the section into four key areas:\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Industry:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> characteristics, patterns, and trends\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Target market: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">characteristics and habits of your target demographic; size, trends, and growth potential of the target market<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Competition:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> characteristics, patterns, and trends<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Pricing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pricing breakdown and patterns of similar products or services\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Describe your offerings and value propositions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two goals for the products and services portion of a business plan: 1) to paint a more vivid picture of your business\u2019s offerings and 2) explain how you\u2019ll position them to your target market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aim to include the following components:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Product or service description:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What is it and how does it work?

If you haven\u2019t yet created your product, share how you plan to bring it to life. You may need to conduct more research, for example, spend three months testing, or nail down the right manufacturer.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Product or service history: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is new, this section may not apply. However, if you\u2019re more established, use this part to share your pricing and explain your typical production process and timeline.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sourcing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Describe the resources and materials you need to produce your products or services, as well as the different vendors you rely on.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Value propositions: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What unique value does each product or service promise to bring your customers? And how will you position your offerings to appeal to your target demographic?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Outline your marketing and sales strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This section is where you demonstrate how you\u2019ll build brand awareness and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can organize it by specific marketing distribution methods and sales tactics, or use the four stages of the sales funnel as a guide. For each item, describe your goals, successes, and potential obstacles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been in business for a while, you can describe what you learned from past marketing and sales strategies, share any challenges you overcame, and explain how you\u2019ll adjust your approach going forward, if at all.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t launched your business yet, list your proposed marketing and sales strategies, back them up with research, and make sure to address any potential concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Compile your financials\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The financial section of your business plan should illustrate your business\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial plan<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or profit potential, as well as address your financial needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-resolutions-business-finances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business financials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to draw from, create a list of estimated startup expenses, a series of quarterly and yearly sales or revenue forecasts, and a cash flow projection. If you\u2019ve already been operating for a year or more, include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income statement\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Balance sheet\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow statement\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expenses analysis<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funding requests or needs.

Spell out your goals\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listing out your short and long-term business goals can help you stay on track. Include quarterly goals, like increasing sales revenue by 5%; annual goals, such as launching a new product; or five-year goals, like opening a second location.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For each goal, explain the steps you\u2019ll take to achieve it, as well as how you\u2019ll measure your progress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Consider adding an appendix<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An appendix isn\u2019t always necessary, but it can be helpful if you\u2019re submitting your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business strategy<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to an investor or lender. In that case, you may want to include copies of business permits and licenses in your appendix, additional data points to support your market analysis, pictures of your products, or resumes of key executives on your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing a business plan is a great way to clarify your goals, organize your finances, and prepare for growth.
