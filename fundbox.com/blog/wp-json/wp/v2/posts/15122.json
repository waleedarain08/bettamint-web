Net present value (NPV)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPV represents the difference between cash inflows and outflows over a specific period of time. When a project has a positive NPV, it signifies that the project will bring in more revenue than you\u2019ll have to pay out to complete it. Generally speaking, projects with negative NPV should be avoided at all costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Internal rate of return (IRR)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IRR refers to how much an investment is expected to grow over a one-year period. This figure is determined using the same equation as NPV, except the NPV value is zero. This method is helpful for comparing expected annual returns of different projects over 12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Profitability index<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profitability index is a simple equation where you divide the present value of expected future cash flows by the associated capital expenditure. If, for example, future cash flows are $500,000 and your project costs $300,000, its profitability index rating would be 1.67. As a rule of thumb, when a project has a profitability index over 1, it will likely be a worthwhile investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Accounting rate of return (ARR)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARR is another capital budgeting accounting method that compares a project\u2019s expected average revenue to how much money the organization invested to make it all happen. Unlike other capital budgeting methods, ARR does not consider cash flow or the time value of money. Still, the metric can be helpful in determining how much revenue you can expect to generate across a number of projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Payback period<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The payback period metric tells you how long it will take to break even on a capital project. Like the ARR, the payback period doesn\u2019t consider the time value of money either. If, for example, a company is considering investing $6 million in a new project that is supposed to return $2 million a year, the payback period would be three years. At the same time, they\u2019re also considering another $6 million project that is supposed to return $1 million a year. In this scenario, the company might decide to go with the first project because they can start making money faster.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pros and cons of capital budgeting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s face it: Capital projects are massive undertakings. Make the right decision, and great things can happen. Make the wrong one, and disaster might be lurking right around the corner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the pros and cons of capital budgeting to help you figure out whether it makes sense for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pros<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helps you compare different kinds of projects along the same metrics to make the best decisions based on data<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gives you a number of different techniques to use to make wise investments<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enables you to deliver more value to stakeholders by increasing the chances you make the best decisions<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cons<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can give you false security because you are dealing with hypotheticals; if a project gets delayed or runs over budget, what good are your calculations?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you make a decision, the implications can be significant; the wrong decision could seriously hurt your organization<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding skilled accountants with bandwidth to make these calculations can be a tall order\u2014and a pricey endeavor<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is capital budgeting right for you?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, capital budgeting can be a particularly helpful mechanism for deciding which capital projects to pursue\u2014and which to put on pause. That said, your capital budgeting calculations are theoretical and not set in stone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you should certainly use capital budgeting to help determine your next moves, you should also be wary to treat these numbers like gospel. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned over the last year, the world can change rapidly overnight, and anything can happen at any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By doing your due diligence and crunching the numbers before moving forward with your next capital project, you can improve the chances your company makes the right moves. And when it boils down to it, that\u2019s the best you and any stakeholders can hope for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s to prioritizing the most profitable capital projects!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When businesses are considering massive undertakings\u2014like building a new facility or investing in expensive new equipment\u2014they generally can\u2019t just dip &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":15124,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[1844,2336,4192],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"top-left-risks","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"The Advantages and Disadvantages of Capital Budgeting | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"When businesses are considering massive undertakings that would exceed their their working capital, it can be helpful to go through a process called capital budgeting to determine whether the investment is worthwhile.
