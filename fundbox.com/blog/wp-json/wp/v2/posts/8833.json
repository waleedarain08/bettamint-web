In our ongoing effort to provide insight and advice for small business owners, we sat down with distinguished financial consultants Jan Haugo and Geni Whitehouse to discuss the latest tax considerations and strategies. In this installment, part 2 of our tax expert interview series, Haugo and Whitehouse discuss the thorny relationship between the\u00a0tax liability of a small business and its cash reserves.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8276\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8276\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8276\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jan-Haugo_headshot.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Haugo\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jan Haugo, President, JH &amp; Associates<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td>\n<td>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8277\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8277\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8277\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Geni-Whitehouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8277\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Geni Whitehouse, CPA, Speaker &amp; Instructor<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>They come out of the woodwork in late December. Last-minute shoppers, ill-prepared for the holidays, blitz malls and grocery stores in a frantic pursuit of presents and supplies. Finding the perfect gift, making the most exquisite meal, and exploiting the biggest sale often give way to a singular focus: The looming deadline.<\/p>\n<p>In many ways, tax season is the same, says Jan Haugo, accountant, small business owner, and former CEO of the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJust like the holidays, everyone knows tax season is coming,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut many still procrastinate, and they overspend or make unnecessary concessions as a result.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For small businesses, effective tax preparation involves more than annual returns. It also demands a continuous and correlated focus on cash flow. Because business success can result in higher taxes and vice versa, the two share an indelible yin and yang relationship.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>If you have a good Q4, you have to consider the tax implications for Q1, says Jan Haugo<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf you have a good Q4, you have to consider the tax implications for Q1,\u201d Haugo insists. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always instinctive. Many will feel flush and overspend at the end of the year, not anticipating a possible increase in both annual and quarterly taxes, which are right around the corner. You don\u2019t want to face a decision in Q1 of whether to pay the IRS or pay your employees.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ebbs and Flows<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cSmall business owners sometimes spend what they make too freely and don\u2019t maintain cash reserves,\u201d says Geni Whitehouse, accountant, author, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpapracticeadvisor.com\/note\/12380697\/geni-whitehouse-cpacitp-2017-most-powerful-women-in-accounting-honoree\">2017 <\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpapracticeadvisor.com\/note\/12380697\/geni-whitehouse-cpacitp-2017-most-powerful-women-in-accounting-honoree\">CPA Practice Advisor<\/a><\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpapracticeadvisor.com\/note\/12380697\/geni-whitehouse-cpacitp-2017-most-powerful-women-in-accounting-honoree\">\u00a0Thought Leader<\/a><\/span>. \u201cWithout cash reserves, it can be difficult to handle the loss of a big customer, shifts in the market, large invoices, and payroll.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to have a financial safety net, she says. But small business owners must first understand the ups and downs of their company, and the ebbs and flows of their cash.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to have all of your financials in one place,\u201d says Haugo. \u201cAnd you need to know how much money you have, how much is coming in, and how much is going out at all times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Without this visibility, the reasons behind a cash shortage aren\u2019t always obvious. Is it because of overspending? Delayed invoicing? Delinquent payments? Seasonal slowdown? Something else?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith 60- and 90-day payment terms becoming more common, small businesses can\u2019t afford to be slow with their invoicing,\u201d Haugo says. \u201cAnd they need to have a clear understanding of their accounts receivable, knowing exactly how much is coming in and when. If there are gaps between payments and payroll\u2014even if it\u2019s only a handful of days\u2014they need to be prepared.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Cash vs. Accrual Accounting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the money in the bank is only part of the tax equation. And that can lead to confusion and missteps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at an empty bank account and make the assumption that you don\u2019t have any tax liability,\u201d says Whitehouse. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always the case. You can be taxed on cash that has been spent on inventory, for example.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How a small business tracks its financials will depend on the method of accounting applied: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/r\/bookkeeping\/cash-vs-accrual-accounting-whats-best-small-business\/\">cash or accrual<\/a><\/span>. The differences between the two\u2014and which one to utilize\u2014are often vexing for the most tax savvy of business owners, Whitehouse says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of small businesses see the cash coming in, but not the cash that will be due,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey don\u2019t put bills into their system until they are ready to pay them, but they should be anticipating and tracking those costs in advance. There\u2019s a difference between when a cost is incurred and when the bill is paid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Purely monitoring the inflow and outflow of cash doesn\u2019t always reveal the true financial health of a business, Whitehouse adds. Looking beyond bank statements and gaining full visibility of the financials\u2014including incurred and impending costs\u2014will help with cash management.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at an empty bank account and make the assumption that you don\u2019t have any tax liability,\u201d says Whitehouse. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always the case.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Getting Help and Being Prepared<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Both Haugo and Whitehouse suggest getting professional assistance, not only for the yin of tax planning but also for the yang of cash management.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed or afraid to ask for help,\u201d Haugo recommends. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to discuss money or ask for money when times are tough, but we\u2019ve all been there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When cash flow wanes, however, it can be difficult to find short-term relief.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSmall businesses gear their books to show the least amount of income and revenue, hoping to minimize their tax liability,\u201d says Whitehouse. \u201cBut then they go to the bank for a loan and are denied because the business doesn\u2019t look healthy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, alternate sources of credit are available, helping small businesses prepare for the inevitable dips in their cash reserves. At Fundbox, helping small business owners survive and thrive is priority number one.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFundbox can help,\u201d Whitehouse says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very cool company, and I\u2019m a big fan. There\u2019s no paperwork, which is a huge change from traditional banks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFundbox is awesome,\u201d Haugo concurs. \u201cThey\u2019re supportive, available, and transparent, with excellent customer service. They really are an advocate for small businesses. But just like I tell my clients, your financials need to be accurate and up to date.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, don\u2019t wait until late December to start preparing for the holidays.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Catch up on Part 1 of our tax expert series:<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-common-tax-mistakes-small-business-owners-make\/\"> 5 common tax mistakes small business owners make<\/a><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>About Geni Whitehouse<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Geni Whitehouse, CPA, divides her time between working as a winery consultant at Brotemarkle, Davis &amp; Co in the Napa Valley and writing, speaking, tweeting, and posting at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evenanerd.com\/\">EvenANerd.com<\/a><\/span>.
