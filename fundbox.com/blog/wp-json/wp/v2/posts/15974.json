You need funding to start achieving your goals. If you\u2019re looking at financing options, a startup business loan is a great solution that allows you to build your business\u2019s credit history, which will help you qualify for other types of credit in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional bank loans can be difficult for entrepreneurs to secure until they have a solid business history and strong business credit. Because many small businesses are underserved by banks, there are plenty of other options available to new businesses looking for financing to help them get started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online term loans and business lines of credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online lenders can provide similar financing options to banks, including term loans and business lines of credit, with significantly streamlined application and approval processes. However, most online lenders require you to be in business for at least six months, as credit decisions are based on your financial history (as opposed to projections).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been in business for more than six months, look for lenders that offer flexible <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and loan options for growing businesses with reasonable interest and annual percentage rates (APR).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rates on loans from online lenders typically start at about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/blog\/what-is-the-average-business-loan-interest-rate-37650\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seven percent.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also consider your repayment terms, to ensure that you can make your regularly scheduled payments without disrupting your cash flow. The more structured your repayment plan, the more likely you are to pay off your loan in time without extra financial burden.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loans from local community organizations\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best places to look for funding, especially when you\u2019re at the beginning of your business journey, is your local business and economic development organizations and nonprofit groups.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lenders like these can provide resources, education, and networking opportunities alongside financing options. They have a vested interest in helping local businesses thrive and can point you towards different funding opportunities as you expand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide access to loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) as well as funds from other lending programs such as the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.toryburchfoundation.org\/programs\/capital\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tory Burch Foundation Capital Program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which provides financing for women entrepreneurs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State and municipal business development programs also provide startup business loans, so check your local government websites for options. For example, New York state offers the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/esd.ny.gov\/metropolitan-economic-revitalization-fund-program\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund (MERF)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for businesses that are creating jobs in low-income areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also many microlenders across the country who work with startups and small businesses to help them get off the ground. Microlenders like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pacificcommunityventures.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pacific Community Ventures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in California and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.liftfund.com\/loan-offerings\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LiftFund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which serves the southeastern U.S., provide access to SBA loans and other financing opportunities alongside educational resources.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asset-based financing\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have a limited business credit history or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/best\/small-business\/startup-business-loans-bad-credit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a low credit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, secured, asset-based financing options like invoice factoring, merchant cash advances, and loans against specific collateral can help you get the financing you need as a startup.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a type of financing where you sell your outstanding invoices to a third party who in turn provides a sum of cash equal to a portion of the invoice amounts. Your clients then pay their invoices to the factoring company. This type of financing works well if you already have a high volume of outstanding invoices in your accounts receivables.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/merchant-cash-advance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">merchant cash advance,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re provided with a sum of money up front that you pay down with a percentage of your credit card sales. This financing option carries one of the highest interest rates, since it does not typically rely on your credit, but is instead based on your everyday customer credit card transactions. This option works best if your customers pay you primarily with credit cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-does-equipment-financing-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equipment financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the best ways for new businesses to get the machinery and vehicles they need to get started because they use the equipment itself as collateral \u2014 similar to a mortgage. You can also leverage <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/na.doosanequipment.com\/en\/news-stories\/the-cutting-edge\/buy-rent-or-lease\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leasing and rent-to-own options<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get the equipment you need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a business owner with a low personal credit score who\u2019s looking for financing, be wary of lenders who say that they will guarantee approval without looking at your business credit or financial standing in any capacity, as these options can turn out to be expensive or untrustworthy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also keep in mind that some lenders will perform what\u2019s known as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/blogs\/ask-experian\/what-is-a-hard-inquiry\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hard inquiry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or \u201chard pull\u201d on your credit report that may negatively impact your credit score, potentially preventing you from securing funding. If several hard inquiries appear on your credit report in a short period of time, you may be less likely to be approved. Online lenders, including Fundbox, take a look at your financial history and only perform what\u2019s known as a soft pull on your credit report when you apply, which will not affect your credit score. Be sure to look for lenders that offer a balance of flexibility around credit requirements and security around repayment terms and interest rates when it comes to securing financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Administration (SBA) microloans<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBA provides <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/micro-loans\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microloans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> up to $50,000 for small businesses to start up and expand. SBA microloans are provided by intermediary, nonprofit lenders who often have a mandate to support small businesses with a focus on minority- and women-owned businesses. This can make it easier for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/small-business\/sba-microloans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">startups and early-stage small businesses to qualify<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the funding they need.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lenders who facilitate SBA funding will have their own terms for the loan, but interest rates are typically between 8 and 13 percent with a maximum repayment term of six years. You can use microloans for most of your business needs, including working capital, inventory, supplies, and equipment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Borrowers need to have a credit score of at least 640, but some lenders offer loans to borrowers with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-loans\/guides\/sba-microloan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scores as low as 575.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Proving that you have steady revenue, providing collateral, and leveraging a cosigner can help you secure a loan even if you have a low credit score. Be aware that it can take around two to three weeks or more to get approval for a microloan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microloans are typically easier for new businesses to obtain than the SBA 7(a) loan, a popular option for established businesses with more credit history who need up to $5 million in financing. To see if microloans are the right option for your business, you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/local-assistance\/find?type=SBA%20District%20Office&amp;pageNumber=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">search here for your local SBA office<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business loans can boost long-term growth<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in your business will pay off as you grow. Startup business loans empower you to build a business you\u2019re proud of with the right resources, equipment, and team members. With financing options that meet your needs, you can feel confident about taking on business debt to achieve your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been in business for more than six months, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apply<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see if you qualify for a business line of credit from Fundbox and get financing to take your business to the next level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
