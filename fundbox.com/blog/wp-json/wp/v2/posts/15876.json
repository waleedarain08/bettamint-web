The value a good accountant can offer your business cannot be overstated. It\u2019s one of the most important decisions you can make for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A qualified and reliable accountant can help you handle dynamic and ever-evolving tax laws and navigate circumstances that could help you to scale your business in the most optimal, efficient, and economical ways. Choosing the right accountant can help you take your business to the next level; choosing the wrong accountant can be counterproductive to your business\u2019s health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it\u2019s vital that you know what to look for in a business accountant and put in the research to ensure you choose a professional who is the right fit for your business. Here are five tips to help you choose the best accountant for your small business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand your needs\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you hire an accountant, you should first have a basic understanding of what you want the accountant to do for you. Do you need someone to handle bookkeeping and financial statements? Or an accountant to help you prepare and file your taxes?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bookkeeper or non-certified accountant can help with day-to-day accounting; however, if you require someone to provide strategic tax advice, file your taxes, or assist with an audit, you might be best off choosing a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Understanding the responsibilities and work you need help with, and how often, is an important step toward finding an accountant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seek referrals and reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you friends with other entrepreneurs or part of a small business association or network in your community? One way to discover a dependable accountant for your business is to ask for recommendations from your peers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, you might also conduct a Google search to find accountants in your area. You can also seek out online reviews and use them to compare and evaluate prospects. LinkedIn, Yelp, or other online communities like Reddit and Facebook may also be helpful resources for referrals and reviews that could inform your decision.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evaluate their qualifications and experience\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A reputable accountant should have the qualifications and experience to support their knowledge and expertise. It may be in your best interest to look for an accountant who has experience working with other businesses in the same industry as you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be beneficial because they are likely to be familiar with the needs, challenges, and tax laws specific to your business type or industry. Training and formal qualifications will determine the type of accountant you can hire and the services they can provide. Here are some qualifications to look for in an accountant:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>CPA certification<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A certified public accountant, or CPA, is an accounting professional who has passed the CPA exam and maintains the necessary qualifications to be a licensed CPA.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/us.aicpa.org\/forthepublic\/findacpa\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">helpful directory<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you can use to find CPAs, accounting companies, and local accounting organizations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Certified Management Accountant (CMA)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CMA is an accounting designation that signifies expertise in financial accounting and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/strategic-management.asp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The certification is sponsored by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). Candidates must have a bachelor&#8217;s degree and two consecutive years in management accounting or financial management.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The CGMA is a global certification issued by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) for CPAs who work in business and government. This certification distinguishes professionals who have advanced proficiency in finance, operations, strategy, and management.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Enrolled Agent (EA)<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An EA credential recognizes professionals, including CPAs, licensed by the government to represent taxpayers. They advise clients, prepare personal and business taxes, and deal with the Internal Revenue Service on matters related to business or personal tax audits.

These include Accredited Payables Manager (APM), Accredited Payables Specialist (APS), Accredited Receivables Specialists (ARS), and Certified Payroll Professional (CPP).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet with prospective candidates and ask questions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve conducted your initial research and compiled a list of a few prospects, it\u2019s time to conduct a series of meetings or interviews with them. This is your opportunity to ask questions and gain a better understanding of how they work. Of course, you might find the answers to some of these questions with a little online research, but it\u2019s still a good idea to spend a few minutes with a prospective accountant to get a better idea of whether they might be the right fit for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few questions you might ask prospective accountants:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What accounting qualifications and training do you have?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of accounting services do you offer?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your fees and how do you charge?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What types of clients do you work with? Do you have experience with other clients in my industry?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What technology or software do you use?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you support my goals? What additional value could you offer my business?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider how they\u2019ll help your business grow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to weigh your options and carefully consider if the accountant you\u2019re considering will be the professional whose financial advice will help you make successful long-range decisions for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some accountants will simply focus on completing the task at hand. They will fill out tax returns and manage your accounts, while others will be more proactive in handling your finances. When you are choosing a business accountant, you should always ask what recommendations they have for saving your company money.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business succeed. Before you choose your small business accountant, you should consider how this professional relationship will ultimately help contribute to, support, and guide your business growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to look at an accountant as an integral member of your team. After all, they can play a pivotal role in the success of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business thrive. On the flip side, an inexperienced or otherwise unqualified accountant can be extremely counterproductive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, to ensure you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/1800accountant.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">choose the accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who is the best fit for your business, be selective and take your time with the decision.
