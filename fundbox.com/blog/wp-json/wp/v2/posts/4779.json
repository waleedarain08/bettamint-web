If you&#8217;re one of the female entrepreneurs chasing your business dreams, even if\u00a0your mom probably didn\u2019t provide your seed round of funding, she did invest in your brand in the very early stages.<\/p>\n<p>Your mom may have been the first women in her family to go to college or the first to have a job outside the home, and she did it while facing the institutional gender bias that brought about the terms \u201cglass ceiling\u201d and \u201cpay gap.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The tech boom has provided today\u2019s female entrepreneurs with more opportunities than our moms had to start a business, but systemic gender bias still exists making it difficult for Millennial women to gain access to capital or get taken seriously in a conference room.<\/p>\n<p>This Mother\u2019s Day think about your role in moving the issue of gender equality forward. Here are some of the top challenges female entrepreneurs face while bootstrapping their dreams\u2014and ways you can overcome them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">1. Networking with other entrepreneurs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s building a client list or looking for a referral, business connections can to make or break any startup endeavor. You may have alumni connections, but those can go stale shortly after graduation. Building a solid professional network is a challenge that is frequently easier for men than women.<\/p>\n<p>Men often use sports as a way to network, heading to the golf course or basketball court to make casual business contacts. There\u2019s also what we all know as the \u201cboy\u2019s club,\u201d which is less an invitation-only locale than an informal promise to look out for one\u2019s peers. Because women are late to the entrepreneurial scene, it\u2019s harder for them to find those established networks of female role models willing to mentor them up the ladder.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to find a professional network, why not start one of your own? You can start by organizing other female entrepreneurs in your field on a social media platform, then find a way to meet in person. Drinks, brunches, and yoga classes tend to encourage female participation, but maybe you have a group of golfers, hikers, or scotch enthusiasts in your circle. Get them together and talk shop.<\/p>\n<p>Is it a lot of extra work? Yes, but if you establish yourself as a leader in your field, you&#8217;ll become a hub of information. Others in your industry will then approach you as the go-to person when a contact is looking to refer business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. Funding for female entrepreneurs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The biggest hurdle for any entrepreneur is probably finding the money to finance their big idea. The trials of women starting businesses have been well-documented over the past few years, and studies have shown that hesitation to lend to female entrepreneurs is not unusual.<\/p>\n<p>A U.S. Senate committee on small business and entrepreneurship recently found that women, who own almost 30 percent of all small businesses, received only 4.4 percent of small business loans.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the 21st Century, women entrepreneurs still face a glass ceiling,\u201d the authors <a href=\"http:\/\/www.microbiz.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/21st-Century-Barriers-to-Womens-Entrepreneurship.pdf\">wrote in the report<\/a>. \u201cWhile women-owned businesses are the fastest-growing segment of businesses, and many succeed, women must overcome barriers their male competitors do not face.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember that network of entrepreneurs from the last tip? They just might be your best resource to help you find the money. Don\u2019t forget to mine information from professional advisors, acquaintances who sit on advisory boards, or even family members who have access to equity.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. Personal branding<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Putting yourself out there on social media can lead to criticism and may publicize any failures. Social media is also particularly harsh on women in all fields, inviting online trolls to harass you as you build a following.<\/p>\n<p>Still, go online anyway. Like it or not, many clients and investors will judge you based on your social media presence, and a successful business depends on a strong social media brand. Learn to ignore the comments section.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">4. Fear of failure<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Huge successes are often borne of major failure, but the pressure for women to always put their best foot forward is intense. Whether it\u2019s the expectation to succeed in a field where women are underrepresented or simply the fear of telling your family you\u2019re leaving a well-paying gig to found a startup\u2014an endeavor that has a 90 percent failure rate.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to the decision of which college to attend or when to have kids, there\u2019s no right answer to the question of when or whether to become an entrepreneur. It depends on your appetite for risk-taking.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">5. Industry mentors<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Women have a much harder time finding mentorships in the business world. Chalk it up to an existing shortage of women in leadership positions or the tendency for older men to gravitate toward younger versions of themselves, neglecting to include young women in their inner circle of mentees.<\/p>\n<p>Take initiative. Your ideal mentor may not even know he or she wants to be a mentor, so ask and remember that sometimes \u201cno\u201d means \u201cnot right now\u201d. Find the right balance of persistence to encourage your ideal mentor to take you on. If you win one over, be prepared to work hard to impress.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most of us owe a debt of gratitude to the institution of motherhood.
