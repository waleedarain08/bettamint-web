Running a successful small business without a budget is virtually impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without easy access to your financial information, many decisions are tougher than they should be. For example: How could you make an informed decision about whether it\u2019s a good time to grow your business, purchase new inventory or assets, or give yourself a raise?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clear, up-to-date budgets can help with questions like these.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A budget is a tool that allows you to measure your ideal financial numbers against your actual figures. Effective budgeting requires regular calibration of the real business environment against the theoretical one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If that sounds daunting or time-consuming, fear not. There are online resources that simplify the process. In fact, there are several downloadable, customizable business budget templates that you can access right now. And just to keep them within your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budget<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (see what we did there?) they\u2019re free!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re going to walk you through seven of our current favorite small business budget template tools, but first let\u2019s look at what you need to know about actually creating a business budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How do I create a business budget?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a business budget is an extremely important step towards making sure your business not only stays on track financially, but is using the funds you have available in the most strategic ways possible. Whether you\u2019re a startup or a more established business, adding a business budget to your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/writing-business-plans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a great way to stay organized and to plan how you can best use your budget to your advantage. If you are running a startup, you\u2019ll want to budget for both your ongoing costs and the costs you will need accrue to actually get your business off the ground.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you create your business budget will depend a lot on what type of budgeting method you pursue. Once you\u2019ve chosen your preferred method, you can use one of the template tools we\u2019re going to discuss to help you actually create your budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Master budget.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a master budget, your budget will involve taking the information from other smaller budgets within your business (think marketing versus labor) and compiling them into one main budget. This type of budget is a good fit for bigger companies with multiple departments who each have their own budgets. A master budget provides a more thorough look at your expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Operating budget.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This type of business budget is very popular and estimates revenues and expenditures during a select period of time. This allows businesses to compare their actual results to their operating budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Financial budget. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you create a financial budget, you\u2019ll look past just your revenue and expenditure and include any assets, liabilities, and stockholder equity in your budget. You\u2019ll use a balance sheet to present this information and to gain a clear vision of your business&#8217;s overall health. This type of budget is often used when a business is pursuing funding, an initial public offering, or a merger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cash budget.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This type of budget estimates how much money will pass through a business during a certain period of time (such as a quarter). A cash budget provides insight into how an organization can meet their immediate financial obligations or if they\u2019ll need the help of financing, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">such as a line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to pay for any upcoming expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Labor budget.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have employees, you may want to consider creating a labor budget that can help determine how many workers you will need to hire to achieve your desired level of production and how much it will cost to do this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Capital budget.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A capital budget helps businesses plan for purchases of large assets. For example, buying a new warehouse or expensive machinery. A capital budget will account for the cost of the asset you plan to purchase and will look at the expected payback period and what the potential return on investment will be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Strategic plan budget. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By incorporating financial information, a strategic plan budget can help create a practical road map for how your business plans to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-growth-on-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you have long term goals, this budget can help you achieve them in a realistic\u2014and frankly financially\u2014possible way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Static budget. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business sales and expenses are fairly consistent, then a static budget may be all you need to keep things on track financially. You won\u2019t alter this budget throughout the year and it can be a great way to identify variations between your budgeted and actual line items. A static budget can also prove useful when evaluating sales performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/6e471203-a049-4828-a138-720086b9078c_Screen20Shot202018-02-2320at209.54.4220AM.png\" alt=\"Capterra budget templates\" width=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.capterra.com\/free-small-business-budget-template\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capterra<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The download available from Capterra includes both a monthly and annual breakdown that can be used on an Excel spreadsheet. \u201cImagine going into a month having no idea what you were going to spend or how much money you were going to make,\u201d the site says. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in having money in your bank account at the end of the month, you might want to start thinking ahead.\u201d The goal of a budget, they say, is to have a \u201cfixed point to track your progress against.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/9b66a6e4-ad8d-4e45-b449-23462ef0a7cb_Screen20Shot202018-02-2320at209.58.5620AM.png\" alt=\"Google sheets budget templates\" width=\"600\/\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/u\/0\/?ftv=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Sheets<\/a><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, you don\u2019t need to look very far to find a range of budget templates.
