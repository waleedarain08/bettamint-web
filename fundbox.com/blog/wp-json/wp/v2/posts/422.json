Signs You&#8217;re Doing Customer Service All Wrong"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Great customer service speaks volumes about a business.\u00a0 Take companies like Zappos and Apple.\u00a0 They\u2019re committed to their customers fully.\u00a0 Read through reviews online and you\u2019ll see instance after instance of them going above and beyond in the name of customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>As a small business owner, you\u2019re bound to make mistakes that you\u2019ll eventually recover from.\u00a0 What happens, however, if you keep flubbing up.\u00a0 Can you keep from losing your cool and losing the respect of your customers?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tell-tale signs that you\u2019re doing customer service all wrong:<\/p>\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t see customer service as another component of marketing your business.<\/strong><br \/>\nWord-of-mouth advertising is powerful.\u00a0 Part of Zappos appeal comes directly from the company\u2019s satisfied customers.\u00a0 They have no problem speaking highly about Zappos and the service they received.\u00a0 This type of feedback is very encouraging for people who never purchased anything from the company.\u00a0 They know that if there is a problem with a product, it will be quickly remedied.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You consider your customers\u2019 silence as a sign that you\u2019re doing things right. <\/strong><br \/>\nNo feedback is every bit as bad as negative feedback.\u00a0 If your customers don\u2019t think you\u2019re listening, they aren\u2019t going to take the time to make suggestions that will help your business.\u00a0 One of the easiest ways to spot potential problems and make situations better is by sending out a customer satisfaction survey.\u00a0 You\u2019ll get honest feedback if you provide people with a method to communicate with you directly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You care more about gaining new customers than keeping the ones that you already have.\u00a0 <\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s important to attract new business but equally important to keep customers loyal.\u00a0 Think about all that it takes to gain a new customer.\u00a0 There\u2019s advertising and promotions involved.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s winning them over initially.\u00a0 That takes time.\u00a0 Retention is key to any successful business.\u00a0 You want new customers AND loyal customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You think speed is the only important aspect of your business.\u00a0 <\/strong><br \/>\nYes, it pays to be efficient but standout customer service is so much more than that.\u00a0 People want to feel valued and respected.\u00a0 They want a say in how they use your products and services.\u00a0 They want to get to know your employees and the personal side of your business.\u00a0 They want to feel better than they ever have before as a consumer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You ignore complaints or fail to address them in a timely manner.\u00a0 <\/strong><br \/>\nIgnoring a hate campaign on social media can be the kiss of death for many small businesses.\u00a0 Make sure to moderate comments and reply to complaints professionally.\u00a0 Bad feedback attracts trolls on the internet.\u00a0 It\u2019s best to tackle a feed by identifying potential solutions for your customers rather than attack their character or act like they didn\u2019t exist in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not uncommon to mess up every now and then but to make a habit of it is inexcusable.\u00a0 Evaluate your customer service skills regularly to identify areas of improvement.\u00a0 If a huge problem presents itself, make sure to address it right away.\u00a0 There\u2019s no fault in being human.\u00a0 There is, however, in not caring enough about your customers to correct an issue that has been brought to your attention.<\/p>\n<p>Pay attention to your customers and they\u2019ll reward you by being loyal.\u00a0 Their family members and friends will come to you for products and services because they know how you will respond.\u00a0 After all, in a sea of constant competition, it doesn&#8217;t pay to be complacent.\u00a0 If you want to stand out, you\u2019re going to have to work for it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Great customer service speaks volumes about a business.\u00a0 Take companies like Zappos and Apple.\u00a0
