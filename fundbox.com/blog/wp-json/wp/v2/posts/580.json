We&#8217;ve discussed ways to gracefully make a serious collection call, but what should you do when a customer feeds you excuse after excuse? Here are meaningless excuses you might hear and some tips dealing with them while remaining professional and maintaining a positive client relationship where possible.<\/p>\n<p><b>I Can\u2019t Pay Right Now<\/b><br \/>\nThe most common and diverse of excuses, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to pay\u201d is a classic. The first way to deal with this type of excuse is to find out why.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cCan you explain why you\u2019re having trouble coming up with the payment this month?\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The answer will usually be expressing some form of a cash flow problem. \u201cWe had more expenses than we had anticipated this month,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for payments from my customers.\u201d Sometimes your client will go into great detail about the problem, hoping you\u2019ll take pity and stop asking for payment at this time.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that you can\u2019t act as a bank for your customers. You have already delivered the goods or services that were agreed to, so it\u2019s the customer\u2019s responsibility to pay you. Period. Explain this in gentle but firm terms.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having cash flow problems right now. I understand how important it is to have customers pay on time, which is why I\u2019m calling you today. Your account is three weeks past due, and we agreed in our contract that you would pay within a week of receiving the invoice.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Be specific and firm that you need to receive a payment. An effective tactic can be offering for them to pay in several installments over the next few weeks or months. This starts getting some of the money in your door while they get their accounts in order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s Not Up to Me<\/strong><br \/>\nThe other category of delinquent customers &amp; their payment excuses falls under the idea of \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me.\u201d Some clients will say it\u2019s someone else\u2019s responsibility to pay, and others will insist that they need more notice before cutting a check.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.fundinggates.com\/2014\/04\/using-contracts-get-paid-time\/\">written a contract<\/a> about who will pay you and how, you&#8217;ve nipped this excuse in the bud. After all, the contract explicitly states who will send you the payment and how much time they need. In that case, the client simply needs a firm reminder of this.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAccording to our original contract, you were to be the main contact for payment. You indicated that you needed 10 business days\u2019 notice, and I sent the invoice to you at the beginning of this month, over 2 weeks ago.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>You held up your end of the contract, now your client needs to hold up his.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that you haven\u2019t outlined payment timing in the contract, you have less recourse for this excuse. Follow up on the specifics of the excuse.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if the client says the accountant has to cut a check, then reach out to the accountant immediately and let him know that the account is past due. If he refers you back to your original contact for payment, then you are armed with that much more information for the next conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Time to Let Go<br \/>\nSometimes people have legitimate, temporary reasons they can\u2019t pay you, and in those cases you should be flexible to accommodate them.<\/p>\n<p>But when they seem to have an excuse every single time you ask for a payment, it may be <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.fundinggates.com\/2014\/01\/7-signs-that-its-time-to-walk-away-from-a-client\/\">time to walk away from that client<\/a>. In any case, maintain your professionalism, fall back on the contract, and be polite but firm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some clients \u2013 no matter how well you deliver your product or service and no matter how carefully you remind &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":584,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11504,326,677],"yst_prominent_words":[839,713,1248,4156,2703,798,4162,4158,4160,4159,3198,3040,1699,2208,4161,4157,3511,3403,3300,3486],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Handle Delinquent Customers","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Learn how to deal with delinquent customers who say they can&#039;t pay.
