There are many reasons small business owners seek out loans, but typically speaking, loans are sought to scale the business, and ultimately make it more profitable. This might include investing in real estate, equipment, and inventory purchases, for example.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a small business loan can be an excellent stepping-stone to help you accelerate the growth of your business, many small business owners are unsure where to start or how to get one. There are certainly plenty of available options, but reviewing them all doesn\u2019t have to be a complex process. If you need help getting started, here are five steps you can take to streamline the application process, increase your chances of approval, and ultimately, set your business up for success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Create a plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to getting a small business loan, try to adopt the perspective of a bank or lending company. They need to weigh the risk of lending to you and your level of preparation can make all the difference. There is no room for improvisation on a small business loan application, which is why it\u2019s important that you do the necessary homework first.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish your reason for borrowing and determine your needs. Create a financial plan that contains a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-calculate-the-true-cost-of-your-small-business-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">detailed estimate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the funds you will need. Develop a carefully planned <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-free-small-business-budget-templates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> containing evidence-based information such as financial forecasts, profit and loss statements, and cash flow records.\u00a0 Assemble any other supporting documentation you may need to submit with your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/writing-business-plans\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This can include your formal business plan, bank statements, personal identification documents, and similar documentation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Research<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many different types of small business loans, and you\u2019ll need to do your research in order to understand which financing option is the best fit for your needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loans can be vastly different depending on the purpose of the financing and how quickly you need access to it. Get to know the basic information and main differences between some of the core small business loan types: long-term versus short-term, equipment, working capital, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/sba-loans\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">government-backed loans.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Consider the likelihood of approval<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many factors that influence whether you\u2019re eligible to obtain a small business loan. Most lenders will need to pull your credit rating to process your application. The very fact that a potential lender is reviewing your credit history can have an impact on your credit score, so it&#8217;s best to be strategic in deciding what and how many loan applications to make. That said, there are also lenders who do not do a hard credit inquiry and instead consider alternative qualifying criteria such as annual revenue. Understanding how you\u2019ll be assessed and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preparing accordingly<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can greatly improve your chances of approval and also spare you wasting time on applications for loans you aren\u2019t likely to qualify for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Prepare and review documentation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your small business loan application is only as good as your documentation. Even if you have a pristine credit history and an excellent business plan, submitting your application with missing or ill-prepared documentation can cause your application to be rejected. If some of your documentation is older or out of date, be sure to review it prior to submitting your application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Below are some of the documents you may be required to submit:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business and personal financial statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business and personal credit report<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business and personal tax returns<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business plan<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business forecast<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State registrations and licenses<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal documentation (articles of incorporation, commercial leases, franchise agreements, and the like)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Apply<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give yourself ample lead time to apply. The time between application and approval differs depending on various factors, including loan amount, loan type, and lender. Application forms for some traditional providers such as banks and credit unions are lengthy and require extensive supporting paperwork. The wait time to hear back on your loan application from these traditional lenders is also usually lengthy, sometimes ranging from one to six months. However, one way to streamline or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/lenders-secrets-speed-business-loan-approval\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">speed up your loan application<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to choose an online lender like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as they can generally provide you with a credit decision in minutes. This is because online lenders typically utilize the latest digital software and automate the application process to ensure it is quick and efficient. Nonetheless, preparing ahead of time, as outlined here, will help you tackle the application with greater ease and efficiency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t let costs or unfavorable terms catch you by surprise. Be sure to carefully read all the fine print. Be on the lookout for application fees, early repayment fees, late repayment fees, and SBA loan guarantee fees \u2014 all these can have an effect on your annual percentage rate (APR).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To-do list for your small business loan application<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a business plan<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a one-pager of your business profile and include:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long you\u2019ve been in business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many employees you have<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax ID number<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Average gross annual revenue<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run a cash flow analysis on your business account<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand and be able to explain your business credit history<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collect at least 3 months of bank statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get business references<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\" aria-checked=\"false\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare tax statements<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many small business owners seek out loans to accelerate the growth of their business.
