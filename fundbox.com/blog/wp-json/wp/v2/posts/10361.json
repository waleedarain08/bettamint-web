After all, you\u2019re a professional and your time is money, and you should always, always, always charge for your work!<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">won\u2019t<\/span>\u00a0ever be asked to work for free. Sometimes you might even be tempted. It could look like a dream client and a good way to get your foot in the door. Or it could be a valuable existing client who keeps pushing for more, and you\u2019re worried about losing a lucrative account.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, a simple \u201cno\u201d might feel a bit abrupt. You don\u2019t want to burn bridges, after all. So how do you stop clients from expecting free work, without jeopardizing your relationship with them? Let\u2019s have a look.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">With New Clients: State Your Policy, But Also Your Value <\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You get an email from a prospective client. Your heart starts racing when you realize it\u2019s dream work for a client you\u2019re dying to work for. But the catch: They can\u2019t pay you. Maybe they promise \u201cexposure\u201d or even hint this might be the start of more\u2026<\/p>\n<p>What do you do?<\/p>\n<p>It helps to have a template response to requests to work for free (and to spend some time thinking about your own policy). You might, for example, decide you will do a certain amount of free work for not-for-profits as a give-back to your community.<\/p>\n<p>But when a large commercial client asks you to work for free, it\u2019s worth having a standard response that asserts your rates. This <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.freshbooks.com\/Awkward-Conversations-Guide-for-Small-Business-Owners-ebook\">e-book from FreshBook<\/a><\/span>s has some starting points (for this conversation and others).<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t leave it there. Explain the value of your work not just in terms of what it costs, but in terms of what it delivers for them. Here&#8217;s an example:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thank you for reaching out! I would love to work with you on this project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">My policy is to do free work for not-for-profit organizations, but for businesses like yours, I always charge for my work. I\u2019ve attached my rate card\/estimate for your information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What will you get in return? You can expect stellar [assets] that drive outstanding [results] for your business. Similar work I did for [clients X, Y, Z] yielded [quantified results].<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">With Existing Clients: Set Expectations from the Start<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Early and often is the rule of thumb for managing your clients\u2019 expectations. Think of it as training: On the first few projects you take on with a new client, \u00a0be a tyrant about scope creepy requests.<\/p>\n<p>This is where strong documentation can help. Set yourself up to make this easy by providing a clear estimate or proposal from the start of every new request or project. That way, when they ask for something more, it\u2019s clear whether the item is covered in that scope of work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/project-estimates\">Project estimates<\/a><\/span>\u00a0help you take the guesswork out of client relationships. They provide a breakdown of services, costs and project length. More importantly, they kickstart good practices and ensure everyone grasps the work involved.<\/p>\n<p>Be diplomatic to preserve the relationship. Take a moment to explain the time and resources it would take to complete their request so they understand it in clear dollars and cents. \u00a0This way they feel like they have a choice in the matter and can either agree to fork out or forgo the request.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Making Exceptions: Don\u2019t Nickel and Dime a Good Relationship<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While charging for work is important, it\u2019s equally important to identify when offering a freebie might be advantageous.<\/p>\n<p>You want to build lasting, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/build-great-client-relationships\/\">positive client relationships<\/a><\/span>. You don\u2019t want your clients to think you\u2019re someone who quibbles over every penny. So, be reasonable, maintain a long-term view, and be willing to let things slide. Consider that sometimes you stand to gain more in the long term from that interaction\u2014that single freebie or favor\u2014than you would from the initial monetary benefit.<\/p>\n<p>One practical way to execute this and show your generous spirit in the name of building that relationship (but make it clear a charge would normally apply) is to add a discount to your invoice.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with giving a loyal client a freebie. But it becomes problematic when the client starts expecting it. And, if you\u2019re not careful you may find yourself doing massive amounts of \u201cfree\u201d work with no money to show for your efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Failure to correct this situation may lead to resentment. And that\u2019s not fun. Thankfully, fixing the situation is easy, and you don\u2019t have to burn bridges with the client. Just take charge and train them to stop expecting it.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have clients who expect free work?
