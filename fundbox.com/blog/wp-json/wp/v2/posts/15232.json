You don\u2019t have a welcome email<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many times have you signed up to receive email updates or a newsletter from a company and felt like your subscription doesn\u2019t matter to them? According to Campaign Monitor, a staggering <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/email-marketing\/2019\/01\/7-welcome-email-dos-and-donts-for-stellar-results\/#:~:text=Frankly%2C%20you're%20never%20going,customers%20or%20potential%20customers%20subscribe.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50% of brands don\u2019t automatically send a welcome email<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to new customers or prospects. This is a huge email marketing mistake because <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/keap.com\/business-success-blog\/marketing\/email-marketing\/how-and-when-to-send-welcome-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">subscribers are the most engaged brands within the first 48 hours of signing-up<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A welcome email is your first opportunity to form a relationship with your subscriber. It also sets the tone for what they can expect from future communications from your company. And, it\u2019s a great opportunity to make a sale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you craft your welcome email, keep your messaging simple and conversational. Thank the subscriber for making you a part of their lives and welcome them to your community. Communicate what they can expect for being a subscriber such as access to the latest news, product releases, special offers, ways to get involved, etc. Offer them a discount in exchange for more information, such as registering with your company or completing a profile (you\u2019ll need this so that you can get to know them better and tailor future emails). Finally, make that call to action clear. Don\u2019t bury it in a ton of copy and use graphics to guide the eye towards it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most email platforms like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, and Emma include ready-to-use email campaign templates to simplify the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. You\u2019re not personalizing your emails<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As humans we crave personalized experiences. It helps us separate one brand experience from another and drives a deeper connection. According to HubSpot, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/email-marketing-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personalized emails have a 26% higher open rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and an improved click-through rate compared to others. But if your email marketing personalization only extends to including your customer\u2019s first name in the communications you send them, you\u2019re missing out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">True personalization is about getting to know your customers likes, needs, and wants and adding that personal touch to each email. There are many ways to personalize your emails. You can use demographic data such as birth dates, location, interests, and gender to tailor your subject lines, body copy, and offers. As you build a relationship with the customer, you can further personalize content based on browsing and purchase history. For instance, you might recommend products or services that are complimentary to an item they\u2019ve purchased in the past. You can also use personalization to send content that is relevant to where your leads are in the sales funnel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever your approach, find ways to drive consistent personalization across the customer journey. The more data you accumulate about each customer, the more opportunities you\u2019ll find to engage with them in a thoughtful way\u2013while driving greater conversions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. You\u2019re not testing which content work best<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not testing which emails perform the best, it\u2019s hard to know which of your email campaigns is the most successful and why. Tracking clicks, open rates, and conversions is important, but you also need to figure out what your audience likes and responds to\u2013before you launch a full-blown campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where A\/B testing comes into play. A\/B testing compares the performance of two or more unique versions of the same email among a sample audience. With A\/B testing you can test any number of variables. For instance, which subject line performs better? Does an offer or call to action receive more clicks if it\u2019s positioned at the top of the email versus at the bottom? Is one time of the day better for delivery?\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most email providers have platforms that offer some form of testing built in. During a test you\u2019ll set up several versions of the same email\u2013A, B and even C\u2013and send then the system will send them to random, small subsets of your email list. All this happens well before you send out your main blast. Once the results are in, review the metrics for your test.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019ve determined the best performing content\/format\/timing, or whatever, you can run with that version of your email.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. You\u2019re not automating your email campaigns<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email automation has come a long way since its early days when we used it to personalize emails and plan drip email campaigns. Today\u2019s email marketing platforms make it easy to create an email sequence that is highly automated, triggering a series of emails based on the customer\u2019s actions. This automation can be used to start a conversation, nurture customers, and even win customers back.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Fundbox customer, digital marketing consultant,\u00a0and founder of <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/geekpoweredstudios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Geek Powered Studios<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Guillermo Ortiz, uses email automation to get customer feedback.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company uses a review tool that automatically sends a customer an email when they are added to the business\u2019 email list. The email asks them to rate their experience. Anything rated seven or above triggers an email to the client asking them to leave a review online. Any poor ratings go straight to the business owner, so that they can address the issue right away,\u00a0before\u00a0an upset customer leaves a negative review online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email had a significant impact. Now approximately 10% of customers leave a review. Considering that Google ranks businesses based on the number of reviews they have it can have a big effect. Positive reviews also make a good impression on prospective customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ortiz\u2019s blog post\u2013<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earn More Sales with Email Marketing Automation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013explains how to build a simple email automation sequence.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>For more small business marketing and sales tips, strategies, tactics, and best practices check out these <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/tags\/marketing-and-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Fundbox blogs<\/b><\/a><b>.<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although modern marketing tactics like social media excel in terms of reach and influence, good old fashioned email marketing is &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":15239,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,10158],"yst_prominent_words":[4917,5257,938,798,8738,6137,715,716,3844,8741,808,4686,8747,4922,794],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-right-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"4 Email Marketing Mistakes You Might Be Making, and How to Avoid Them | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Still one of the most effective marketing tools for small businesses, email has evolved into an important multi-generational channel.
