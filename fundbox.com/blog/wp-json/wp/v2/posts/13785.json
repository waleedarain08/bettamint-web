You have many choices, ranging from traditional banks to online fintech providers\u2014including Fundbox, Kabbage, OnDeck, and BlueVine. To help you compare options for a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\">business line of credit<\/a>, this article provides a quick description of the key differences between them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a business line of credit?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A line of credit provides an amount of capital that you can draw against\u2014up to your credit limit\u2014and repay over time. Similar to a credit card, most lines of credit are revolving; this means that as you repay the amount you\u2019ve drawn, your available credit replenishes and you can draw against it again, repeatedly, without having to apply for a brand new loan. This makes a line of credit an attractive option, for once approved, funds can be accessed quickly, so your money is ready when you are.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current with COVID<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article is current as of October, 2020, and the research cited herein reflects the state of the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key questions to ask<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering your options for a business line of credit, we recommend you ask yourself the following questions, concerning the provider and what you need:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Is the provider actively lending? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the pandemic struck, many lenders suspended accepting new applications, even though their website may have still displayed an active \u201capply now\u201d button. Before applying, it\u2019s helpful to try and verify if they\u2019re looking for new customers or not. Fundbox never stopped accepting applications from new customers or originating loans to existing customers throughout the pandemic. On the other hand, the economic slowdown has affected all lenders differently. For example, Kabbage stopped<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/17\/kabbage-turned-to-doling-out-ppp-loans-to-save-its-lending-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> approving new customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> very early, in March, 2020.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How much do you really need? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it may seem tempting to ask for as much money as possible, this comes with a risk. If you\u2019re approved for more than you actually need, you might end up facing difficulty repaying whatever you use. You may be able to do more with a smaller amount (and therefore less credit exposure). That\u2019s because, with revolving credit, you can reuse the funds as you repay them and the available credit amount replenishes.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>How quickly do you need the money? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes new business opportunities arise that require an immediate response; a new client calls with a fast deadline, or an old client has a last-minute request. If that happens, you might want to prioritize a lender with a streamlined application or a fast decision process so you can get an answer and confidently take on the new work if you\u2019re approved.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13789\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png\" alt=\"Comparison matrix chart for business lines of credit, comparing Fundbox, Kabbage, OnDeck, and BlueVine\" width=\"1422\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM.png 1422w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-4.25.18-PM-768x301.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1422px) 100vw, 1422px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the application process<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every lender is different, and that extends to their application process, as well as their requirements and timeline. Before choosing a lender, learn about their processes and the information and qualifications they need from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How much time does the application require? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at each prospective lender\u2019s form and estimate how long it will take you to complete the application. This is especially important if you need a credit decision in a hurry.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>What information do they require? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some information you may be asked for includes your company\u2019s federal tax ID. Do you have such information handy? Many applications ask for personal details for each person who owns more than 25% of the business, to verify their identities. Plus, most applications will ask for some way to demonstrate the performance or economic health of your company. For example, they may ask to connect your business bank account or accounting software.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How can they provide a credit decision? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because the provider\u2019s credit application is available online doesn\u2019t mean they will give you a result in seconds. Sometimes lenders can take hours or even days. Fundbox\u2019s application was optimized to give a fast decision\u2014within minutes, for most customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Qualification criteria are just the beginning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you meet the eligibility requirements? Every lender has a different minimum criteria for deciding which businesses to extend credit to. You should note that even if you meet the minimum criteria, you won\u2019t necessarily get approved. Many lenders take a number of different factors into consideration when approving customers\u2014the minimum criteria simply being the first filter that applicants must pass through.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, while Fundbox has minimum requirements, a \u201ctypical\u201d customer of ours exceeds those minimums and has around $300,000 in annual revenue and has been in business for years, not months.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terms: the length of your loan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While possibly not at the top of each business\u2019s list, loan terms are a key consideration when looking for a line of credit. Some companies specialize in longer payback periods while others ask to pay back quickly. Do you prefer monthly or weekly payments? Do you want to repay in 12, 24, or 52 weeks?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer experience matters<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business line of credit is a tool you might be using often, depending on your needs. We recommend you consider the product experience and availability of customer support before making a decision. Some companies have invested in design and have built a streamlined product. Others might lack that attention to user experience (UX). Design can affect the speed to which you can complete an application, draw funds, and even your overall satisfaction with the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, customer support (customer service) can be critical to your happiness with your business line of credit. Imagine if you had a question about the product, or a problem you needed to resolve, but no one would pick up the phone? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/stevieawards.com\/sales\/fundbox-customer-service-success\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox won the gold Stevie Award<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for outstanding customer support in the financial services category, but not all companies have invested in the team and technology needed to deliver a great experience over the phone and email.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While companies themselves can talk about a great experience or the awards they\u2019ve won, a good indicator of the level of service they provide is the reviews their customers have written about them. Sites like Trustpilot or the Better Business Bureau allow customers to post their reviews with comments so you can get a better sense of their real-world experiences and what they like and dislike about the company and its line of credit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lender\u2019s own stability<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world of economic uncertainty, we thought we should add a section on company stability. If you\u2019re going to apply for a line of credit with a company, you should consider whether or not you think the company will be around for the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few questions to ask yourself as you do your research are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did they handle the pandemic? Did they continue lending?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did they fundraise recently or do they have money in the bank to handle economic fluctuations?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Were they acquired by another company?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox was fortunate to raise over $170 million in 2019, and we have kept the vast majority of that money in the bank to protect ourselves from the unexpected. We continued originating new loans throughout the pandemic, and continued taking on new customers during that time as well.<\/span><\/p>\n\n    <section class=\"cta-section\">\n        <h3>\n            Ready for more?\n        <\/h3>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-8 col-xl-9\">\n                <p>Apply for funding and find out if you qualify today<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 col-xl-3\">\n                <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup?utm_source=fundbox&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=featured&utm_content=business-line-of-credit-comparison\" class=\"signup-btn\">\n                    Apply Now\n                <\/a>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply to Fundbox<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think Fundbox might be a good fit, you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>apply any time<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
