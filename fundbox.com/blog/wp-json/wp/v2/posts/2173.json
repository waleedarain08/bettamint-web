According to the folks at <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.credit.com\/2015\/08\/is-student-loan-debt-suffocating-american-entrepreneurs-122441\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credit.com<\/a>, student debt is a particular problem for the smallest of small businesses \u2013 those with one to four employees.<\/p>\n<p>Why? To start or grow a business, you need cash. If you don\u2019t have reserves then you need to borrow it. For that you need to demonstrate that you are in a financial position to take on debt, if a student loan is eating away at your already limited financial resources, the chances of getting a loan are slim.<\/p>\n<p>So what are your options? Well, first and foremost, you need to eliminate your debt \u2013 an action that can also improve your credit score. Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<p><strong>If You Have a Federal Student Loan<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you have a federal loan you don\u2019t have to stick with the same repayment plan, you can change at any time. StudentAid.gov offers an overview of your options <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/repay-loans\/understand\/plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>. These give you the flexibility to potentially reduce your interest payment and term of the loan. The available plans also take into consideration financial hardship and current and predicted income levels. Use this Repayment Estimator\u00a0to get an idea of which plans you may be eligible for and get estimates for how much you would pay monthly and overall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If You Have a Private Student Loan<\/strong><br \/>\nThese loans tend to be less flexible but talk to your lender to see what options you have for changing or\u00a0refinancing your repayment plan.<\/p>\n<p>Check out this comprehensive blog from Student Loan Hero &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/studentloanhero.com\/tag\/student-loan-repayment-options-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Beginner\u2019s Guide to Paying Off Student Loans<\/a> \u2013 for more tips on paying off federal and private student loans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Explore Other Options<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile you\u2019re busy paying off your student loan but still dreaming of entrepreneurship, think of other ways to get started, while reducing your debt.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, could you run your business as a freelancer or contract worker on the side (while still employed as a salaried nine-to-five employee)? This would give you time to earn a little extra and put it towards paying off your debt, while building your network and client base.<\/p>\n<p>You should also be making smart banking decisions. Consider opening an account with a credit union as opposed to a traditional bank. They tend to provide more affordable services (lower fees and interest rates on loans), they are also lending at a pace that outpaces banks (something that could come in handy when you are ready to apply for a business loan).
