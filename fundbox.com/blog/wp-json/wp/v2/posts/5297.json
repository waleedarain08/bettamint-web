But one small business vertical you might not think of is the death care industry, specifically handcrafted caskets by a sustainable, green business.<\/p>\n<p>Jonas Zahn founded the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northwoodscasket.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Northwoods Casket Company<\/a>\u00a0to build sustainable, handcrafted burial products in an industry that\u2019s been overrun by manufactured products imported from China and Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a green and natural burial movement that started in the United Kingdom 15 years ago and came to America maybe 10 years ago,\u201d Zahn says. \u201cThere is also a return to the craft movement in America: things that are made by hand. People are once again genuinely interested in things that are made by the hands of people and not by machines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5303\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/035_DSC0324.jpg\" alt=\"Northwoods Casket workshop\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The business-to-business company sells caskets directly to funeral homes and employs both contractors and full-time employees, which can create challenges in terms of cash flow and payroll.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe picked the casket business because it\u2019s very difficult to get into,\u201d says Zahn. \u201cWhen a funeral home needs a casket, they don\u2019t need it next month, they need it tomorrow. We have an inventory of caskets that we can deliver the same day\u2014or the next day\u2014once we receive a call from a funeral home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The problem? Funeral homes don\u2019t get paid until the insurance company pays the family, who in turn pays for the funeral. Northwoods Casket has an average accounts receivable of 45 days after they deliver a finished product.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost every other week is a situation like that, where we are very squeezed already in terms of having capital available for cash flow,\u201d says Zahn. \u201cWe have orders coming in that we need to deliver tomorrow. We need to replace inventory, order lumber, order material\u2014all which require a lot of capital. We\u2019re constantly in a pinch for cash flow to make our payroll and pay for the raw materials. \u201c<\/p>\n<p>Because his casket business isn\u2019t part of the disruptive tech sector, venture capital firms aren\u2019t regularly pinging Zahn\u2019s inbox to offer funding. Zahn\u2019s company isn\u2019t a fit for traditional loans, either.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5302 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/031_MG_8053_dmv_4x6.jpg\" alt=\"Jonas Zahn of Northwoods Casket\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/031_MG_8053_dmv_4x6.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/031_MG_8053_dmv_4x6-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/031_MG_8053_dmv_4x6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey want you to have six years of history when you apply for the loan,\u201d says Zahn. \u201cI\u2019m really frustrated with banking and what SBA lending has matured into in the last two decades. Even with proven business models, they want far more history than a small startup business has.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a>, the cash-flow management platform, fills the void. Zahn runs his entire company\u2014from invoices to inventory\u2014in the cloud. He discovered Fundbox while using the invoicing software FreshBooks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I saw it, it didn\u2019t take me long to decide to try it,\u201d Zahn recalls. \u201cI clicked on the link, created a Fundbox account, submitted all my information. Within 48 hours after deciding to take a look, we had cash in our account that we could use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fundbox made it much easier for Zahn to manage his company\u2019s accounts receivable and cash flow. The service provides Northwoods Casket funds right down to the invoice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe scale up and we pay it back quickly. It works very well, and it\u2019s a good model,&#8221; says Zahn. &#8220;We\u2019re at the point where I expect to double again this year and double again next year and then sustain,\u201d says Zahn. \u201cWe\u2019re a healthy business in terms of profitability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5304\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/wood-hinge-26.jpg\" alt=\"Northwoods Casket workshop\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/wood-hinge-26.jpg 1804w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/wood-hinge-26-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/wood-hinge-26-1536x1022.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Zahn has seen tremendous growth since founding the business and hopes his Wisconsin-based company will play a small part in reducing the oil and gas consumption and unsustainable lumber milling associated with making most caskets. A green business, Northwoods Casket avoids harmful chemicals and vapors when building its caskets and sources most of its wood, upholstery, and labor within Wisconsin. The startup offers more than 30 casket styles at prices ranging from $500 to $5,000 for traditional burials, natural burials, or cremations.<\/p>\n<p>A green business indeed, the\u00a0company also plants 100 trees for every casket it builds and have already sponsored a tree-planting of 15,000 mixed species in the Kettle-Moraine Wisconsin State Forest. They also make an annual donation to City of Beaver Dam Forestry Department, which pays for thousands of new tree seedlings for the city nursery every year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlanting 10 million trees in my lifetime isn\u2019t just a goal,\u201d Zahn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northwoodscasket.com\/what-we-do\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote on his website<\/a>, \u201cIt\u2019s a commitment I\u2019ve made to the people of Wisconsin. It\u2019s a promise I made to my two children.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5305\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/SRC_008_MG_8700_dmv_green.jpg\" alt=\"Northwoods Casket tree planting\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Small businesses across all types of verticals choose Fundbox for their cash flow needs: construction companies, marketing and design agencies, &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":5301,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11504],"yst_prominent_words":[1683,723,3202,713,7144,7147,7149,757,7148,3198,838,7150,7145,7146,4722,7142,7151,7141,1521,7143],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How Northwoods Casket Uses Fundbox to Build a Green Business | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Jonas Zahn founded the Northwoods Casket Company, a Wisconsin-based green business, to build sustainable, handcrafted burial products."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"How Northwoods Casket Uses Fundbox to Build a Green Business | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Jonas Zahn founded the Northwoods Casket Company, a Wisconsin-based green business, to build sustainable, handcrafted burial products."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-northwoods-casket-uses-fundbox-to-build-a-green-business\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Northwoods-Casket.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Northwoods-Casket.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1804"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"1200"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Jonas Zahn founded the Northwoods Casket Company, a Wisconsin-based green business, to build sustainable, handcrafted burial products."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"How Northwoods Casket Uses Fundbox to Build a Green Business | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Northwoods-Casket.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-northwoods-casket-uses-fundbox-to-build-a-green-business\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5297"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/15"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5297"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5297\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16151,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5297\/revisions\/16151"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/5301"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5297"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5297"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5297"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=5297"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
