Some lenders determine credit eligibility based on the business owner&#8217;s personal credit score. Others require massive amount of paperwork to determine a business credit line. With Fundbox, personal credit score or time-consuming paperwork are\u00a0not required\u00a0to get started.<\/p>\n<p>A business line of credit has many benefits for manufacturers compared to a traditional business loan.

When you have an available business line of credit, this is no problem. For example, with Fundbox\u00a0Credit, you can draw funds from your available credit anytime you want. If you don\u2019t need the money, don\u2019t use it. If you do need it, access your <i>Fundbox business line of credit<\/i> with just a few clicks.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cash flow<\/strong>: You have to start paying back a business loan immediately\u2014even if you aren\u2019t using the money right away. With a business line of credit, however, you don\u2019t repay the credit line until you actually draw money from it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Control<\/strong>: When you get a traditional business loan, you have to show the lender what you plan to use the money for. If they don\u2019t approve of that plan, you won\u2019t get the loan. With a business line of credit, you can use the money for any business purpose you choose, so you\u2019re in control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\">business line of credit<\/a> solutions from Fundbox.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Business Line of Credit: The Lifeline for a Manufacturing Businesses Does your company manufacture products that are sold during the &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":7885,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[1707,1706,1704,1844,3202,713,739,1852,1142,1843,1660,3235,1529,1846,1693,1855,1863,1862,1522,1682],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Business Line of Credit: Manufacturing Businesses | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"The benefits of a business line of credit for a manufacturing business and how to create a working capital plan to use for purchase order financing."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Business Line of Credit: Manufacturing Businesses | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"The benefits of a business line of credit for a manufacturing business and how to create a working capital plan to use for purchase order financing."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-line-credit-manufacturing-business\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/WorkingCapital_Manufacturing.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/WorkingCapital_Manufacturing.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1702"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"630"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"The benefits of a business line of credit for a manufacturing business and how to create a working capital plan to use for purchase order financing."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Business Line of Credit: Manufacturing Businesses | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/WorkingCapital_Manufacturing.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-line-credit-manufacturing-business\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7881"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7881"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7881\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16082,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7881\/revisions\/16082"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7885"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7881"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7881"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7881"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=7881"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
