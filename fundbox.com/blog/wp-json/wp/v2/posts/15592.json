For example, if you own a local <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz\/id1150510297?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">house painting business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/start-food-truck-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">food truck operation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, your time might be better spent focusing on sales and customer success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, if you\u2019re an expert at what you do and are interested in helping other people follow in your path, a podcast can be a great vehicle to make that happen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To continue the above examples, why not launch a podcast teaching other people how to become expert house painters or food truck owners? You never know when such a podcast might take on a life of its own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many other kinds of businesses\u2014including marketing agencies, software companies, and even local accounting firms\u2014a podcast might even be a no-brainer. When you record content regularly, you end up with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/podcasts-videos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">library of podcasts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that serves as great marketing content your audience can discover at any time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I start a podcast for my business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite what you might think, starting a podcast doesn\u2019t have to be a massive undertaking. All you need is a name, a theme, a good microphone, and a good script to get started. You\u2019ll also need to determine a show format (e.g., will you interview guests or just tell stories?).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re up for the challenge, you should be able to produce your first episode on your own without too many headaches. A word to the wise: If you take this route, the quality might not be where you wished it were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019re really committed to podcasting for your business, you might be best off outsourcing production to a company that specializes in podcasts. Record a show, pass it off to the pros for polishing, and get back to do what you do best: serving your customers to the best of your abilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you decide, here\u2019s to discovering podcasts that help you get to the next level in your entrepreneurial journey\u2014and potentially launching your own show to inspire the next generation to do the same.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As new entrepreneurs find out all too soon, you need to check an incredible amount of boxes when you\u2019re starting &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":15595,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[10410,21],"tags":[72,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[723,8108,1654,4119,712,8107,3300],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-left-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Best Business Podcasts for Entrepreneurs | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Read about 10 of the best business podcasts for new entrepreneurs\u2014and some reasons why you might want to launch a podcast of your own."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Best Business Podcasts for Entrepreneurs | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Read about 10 of the best business podcasts for new entrepreneurs\u2014and some reasons why you might want to launch a podcast of your own."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-podcasts-entrepreneurs\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/shutterstock_1843949791.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/shutterstock_1843949791.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Read about 10 of the best business podcasts for new entrepreneurs\u2014and some reasons why you might want to launch a podcast of your own."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Best Business Podcasts for Entrepreneurs | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/shutterstock_1843949791.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-podcasts-entrepreneurs\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15592"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15592"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15592\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15662,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/15592\/revisions\/15662"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/15595"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15592"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=15592"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=15592"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=15592"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
