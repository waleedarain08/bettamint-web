You would love to hire another, but you know that most college students can\u2019t commit to a full-time job until the school year is over.<\/p>\n<p>But, you don\u2019t have to wait until the spring to start your summer intern search. You can hire a co-op student right now.<\/p>\n<p>Co-op students are like summer interns except they typically work full-time for six months instead of 10 weeks. They often attend colleges with established co-op programs, also known as cooperative education. Some of the better-known programs are run through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.northeastern.edu\/coop\/employers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Northeastern University<\/a> in Boston, <a href=\"http:\/\/drexel.edu\/scdc\/employers\/hire-coop\/process\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drexel University<\/a> in Philadelphia, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rit.edu\/co-op.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rochester Institute of Technology<\/a> in Rochester, NY, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.uc.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> University of Cincinnati<\/a>. At Northeastern, for example, students are expected to blend their education with real-time job experience by working at two to three different co-op employers. This means that students typically graduate in five years instead of four, yet they leave college with 12-18 months of job experience under their belts.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in hiring a co-op student to work at your business? Take a look at some of the benefits:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Co-ops can add to your company\u2019s talent pool<\/strong> <strong>and become valued employees now and in the future<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen you employ a co-op student for six months, you have enough time to train the new hire and give him the chance to take on challenging tasks. This can significantly boost your productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Ben Rubin, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.10percenthappier.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10% Happier in Boston<\/a>, has hired two students from Northeastern as developers and designers. Both of them were fabulous additions to 10% Happier, a start-up that created and now markets a meditation and coaching app to help people learn to meditate. The co-op students were an integral part of the team, particularly as they could really sink their teeth into projects.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a six-person company and when we add a co-op, we are measurably adding to our workforce,\u201d Rubin says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Patriot Ledger, a regional newspaper in Quincy, Ma., also partners with Northeastern to hire co-op students in the news and sports departments. The students work as reporters, video editors, and get to dig into meaningful journalism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t function without them. We need them to produce, and they do,\u201d says Online Editor Ken Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>And, if you are lucky, you may be able to snag your co-op student immediately after he graduates. Take a look at Northeastern\u2019s success rate: 50% of its 2015 graduates received a job offer from one of their previous co-op employers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Co-op hires are a cost-effective way to meet your human resource needs.<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen you partner with a university to hire the best and the brightest, there are no recruitment costs, you don\u2019t have to offer benefits, and you can pay co-op hires as temporary hourly employees instead of putting them on salary.<\/p>\n<p>The Patriot Ledger relies on Northeastern\u2019s co-op advisors to help them find and attract top student talent. Year after year, the paper has worked with exceptional co-ops who help improve productivity at a minimal cost. \u201cWe are so happy with the quality of talent,\u201d says Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the best human resources perk: You don\u2019t have to extend health insurance to co-op students. Their schools ensure that they are already covered. On the flipside, you can always choose to extend other low-cost perks to co-ops. For example, you may consider offering co-op students free lunches, a shuttle bus from college areas, or game nights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not located near a university with a co-op program? No worries.<\/strong><br \/>\nCollege co-op programs help place students in jobs around the country and world. Northeastern co-op students, for example, have worked throughout the United States, as well as in 131 countries on all seven continents. And Rochester Institute of Technology\u2019s co-op program partners with more than 1,900 employers worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, as you hustle to attract top talent in a competitive market, a co-op student might be a perfect solution to your company\u2019s hiring needs and become a valued addition to your growing team. Why wait for summer? There\u2019s no time like the present.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summer is long gone and so is your fabulous intern.
