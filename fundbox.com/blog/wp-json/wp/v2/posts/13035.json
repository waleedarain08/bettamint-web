Natural disasters and economic crises alike can halt operations, drain your resources, and force you to make hard choices.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain disasters\u2014like the coronavirus\u2014are black swan events, meaning no one could have predicted them. Still, it\u2019s critical to develop a plan to get your business in shape for crises of all kinds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are seven valuable lessons on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/manage-your-business\/prepare-emergencies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preparing your business for a future disaster<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Conduct annual risk assessments<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting annual risk assessments can help you identify threats to your business, including potential financial issues or office safety hazards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe ability to prepare for a crisis starts with the ability to see the potential scale of the crisis,\u201d said Christine Matzen, the founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oakstreetstrategies.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oak Street Strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When you\u2019re gauging risks, evaluate these three areas.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Finances<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Review your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/why-every-business-needs-cash-flow-forecasting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, expenses, debts, and sales forecasts to check your business\u2019s financial health over the next six months or year. You may notice red flags or areas you can improve upon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Technology and equipment: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data breaches and other cybersecurity threats can damage your business\u2019s reputation and result in lost profits. \u201cTechnology is constantly evolving,\u201d so it\u2019s important to audit your company\u2019s security systems, said Rob Stephens, a CPA and the founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cfoperspective.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFO Perspective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You may need to install a business-grade network security appliance, for example, or start using multi-factor authentication for employee accounts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Office: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get your building inspected for hazards, and consider your business\u2019s risk factor for disasters like hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. You may even want to consult a local firefighter for preparedness tips, Matzen said. \u201cThey can also inform you of how their agencies work during a crisis, so you will know about triage centers or other crisis plans that you can incorporate.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Train employees to handle different situations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you pinpoint the risks to your business, work on developing an employee <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/management-during-coronavirus\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">training plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give basic CPR and first aid training to your employees first, Matzen said. \u201cIn addition, you should always have employees trained in your escape plan, disaster preparedness, and any hazardous materials information.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also crucial to cross-train employees to ensure at least three people know how to do every job within your company, Stephens said. \u201cAt a minimum, have a set of procedures for all your critical processes saved in a location that you can access in an emergency.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teaching employees how to adopt new roles and adapt to different working conditions can prevent downtime during a disaster.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Outfit your business with emergency supplies<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stocking your business with emergency items helps minimize damage and save lives. Consider gathering necessities like a fire extinguisher, first aid kit, medication, and sustenance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou should always consider keeping three days of shelf-stable food and water on hand for all employees, and possibly customers should a disaster strike that requires you to shelter in place,\u201d Matzen said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ready.gov\/business\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">helpful items<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> include:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hand sanitizer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-bacterial wipes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gloves<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masks<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flashlights\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Batteries\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blankets\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phone chargers\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Build a cash reserve<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/covid19-cares-act-explained\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial implications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of natural and economic disasters can be\u00a0 massive. Depending on the situation, you may have to renovate your office, replace damaged inventory, issue refunds to customers, or temporarily shut down.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why \u201cbusinesses should keep a cash reserve equal to three to six months of their expenses,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThree months is the bare minimum. Six months provides a healthy reserve that can be tapped for unexpected opportunities.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by adding your monthly costs\u2014including rent, utilities, mortgage payments, loan payments, payroll, and inventory\u2014to see where you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/use-job-costing-to-manage-expenses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cut expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If the majority of your cash goes toward mortgage payments, for example, see if you can sublease a part of your building to another business. Or check your inventory to see if you have dead stock tying up your cash flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a cash reserve takes time, but making strategic changes and sacrifices can pay off in the event of a disaster.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Prioritize your workforce<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are the lifeblood of any business, so it\u2019s crucial to put policies in place that address their needs during a crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn a disaster, your employees\u2019 primary concern is taking care of their families,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cFind ways to help them take care of their families so they can then turn their attention to helping your company.\u201d That might mean offering work from home options or providing child care, he added.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a good idea to review your paid leave, health insurance, and sick time policies to see whether or not you can offer more options or flexibility. Covering spousal health insurance, for example, or offering hazard pay to workers in tough conditions can make employees feel valued and motivated during difficult times.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Diversify your offerings\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disasters can derail normal operations, but finding ways to continue <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/retail-business-covid-survival\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">catering to customers or clients<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you stay afloat. Start by identifying which area of your business drives the most profits, whether it\u2019s a product, service, or passive revenue stream. From there, brainstorm ways you can double-down on that area or change it entirely to solve a customer issue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThink outside the box,\u201d Matzen said. \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may mean that you use your resources to pivot in the market to meet a new need that arises to weather the storm.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a brick-and-mortar stationery shop, for example, consider building an online store in case you can\u2019t conduct business in person. Or, if you manufacture phone cases, consider what kinds of other products you could create using the same materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being adaptable is key to surviving difficult periods and evolving as a business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Rebuild with the future in mind<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disasters are learning opportunities. Instead of burying your head in the sand, think about which strategies worked well in the face of disaster, including the policies that protected employees or tempered your financial losses. Next, acknowledge the areas where you weren\u2019t prepared and ask yourself what you could have done to alter the outcome, Matzen said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is very important during this stage that you fill in your gaps of knowledge by consulting experts,\u201d she added. Reach out to your accountant, talk to your lawyer, and ask your customers what they need from your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Preparing for disaster can help you stay afloat, retain employees, and protect your profits.
