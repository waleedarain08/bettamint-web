Could the problem be your invoicing? According to one study, 49 percent of invoice disputes are because of invalid or missing purchase order information. Invoicing mistakes happen all the time, but most can be avoided if you follow some basic procedures. Try these eight invoicing tips to speed up your receivables.<\/p>\n<p>1. Clients should never be surprised by anything on the invoice. Prices and the detailed description of services should be discussed in the beginning of the work. Surprises require going back and forth to figure out problems, and that delays payment. If there\u2019s something confusing about the amount, don\u2019t be surprised if the recipient places the invoice in the \u201cproblem\u201d pile instead of the \u201cto be paid\u201d pile.<\/p>\n<p>2. If you\u2019re invoicing for only a partial payment\u2014for example, if the work you did involves a deposit on services\u2014then make sure to clearly explain that in the description. Indicate on the invoice what the balance will be on completion of the work, so there isn\u2019t any confusion later.<\/p>\n<p>3. An invoice design that has too many extras or is laid out in a complicated manner can mean more delays. Your clients want invoices to be simple and clutter-free. Your logo and a simple invoice design is all that is needed. Plus, many companies still make copies of invoices, and a clean, white background reproduces better.<\/p>\n<p>4. Make the contact information easy to find on the invoice. If there are questions about the invoice you want the client to be able to contact you right away. Include a name, phone number and email address near the top or near the payment amount. For example: \u201cBilling questions? Contact John Smith at 555-55-5555 or jsmith@mybusiness.com.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>5. If you want a quicker payment schedule, try shortening your terms. Most businesses make the payment due 30 days from invoice date; however, you could shorten that to 14 or 21 days. If you include an incentive for early payment, say a percentage off the total, it could also speed up payment.<\/p>\n<p>6. Don\u2019t guess who the contact person is or just send the invoice to Accounting (unless you\u2019ve been asked to do so). Know exactly who the invoice is going to and the correct email or street address. Get this upfront when the service is agreed on. You don\u2019t want the email or postal letter getting lost in some random employee\u2019s inbox. Before sending the invoice, it\u2019s a good idea to send an email saying, \u201cHi, we are getting ready to invoice and I just want to make sure you are the correct person.\u201d Also, if you invoice via email, be sure to include a \u201cread receipt.\u201d You\u2019ll be notified when the person has read the email, so you can be sure the invoice arrived where it was supposed to go.<\/p>\n<p>7. Many customers and clients have a preferred system of payment such as ACH, Chase ePay, or their own internal application. Before you get started invoicing, make sure you know how they preferred to be invoiced and how they prefer to pay. Speed payments by accepting all kinds of payment, from PayPal to electronic deposit.<\/p>\n<p>8. Never wait too long to follow up on late invoices. Send a friendly reminder email asking, \u201cDid this fall through the cracks?\u201d and if you still don\u2019t receive a response, follow up with a phone call. Most clients will appreciate your efficiency.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Invoicing and getting paid should be fairly simple and yet, for some reason your clients are often slow to pay. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":876,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11532,677],"yst_prominent_words":[1701,773,5144,5147,1257,821,2521,985,774,846,5143,785,2859,3041,3040,1699,5146,4922,5145,3090],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Is the Way You Invoice Hurting Your Cash Flow?","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Invoicing and getting paid should be fairly simple and yet, for some reason your clients are often slow to pay."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Is the Way You Invoice Hurting Your Cash Flow?"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Invoicing and getting paid should be fairly simple and yet, for some reason your clients are often slow to pay."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/is-the-way-you-invoice-helping-or-hurting-cash-flow\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/pay-here-241_1280.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/pay-here-241_1280.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1280"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"854"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Invoicing and getting paid should be fairly simple and yet, for some reason your clients are often slow to pay."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Is the Way You Invoice Hurting Your Cash Flow?"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/pay-here-241_1280.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/is-the-way-you-invoice-helping-or-hurting-cash-flow\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1900"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16115,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions\/16115"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/876"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1900"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=1900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
