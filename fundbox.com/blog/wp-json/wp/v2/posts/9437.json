With customer needs and trends constantly changing, diversification is key to success in the home services market. This means taking your business in a new direction but using the current business as your basis for doing so.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips to help you stay ahead of the curve and get your share of the home services business in your town.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Explore New Directions<\/h2>\n<p>One benefit of diversification is that it allows you to increase the integrated service offerings you provide to existing customers. For example, a cleaning company could diversify beyond its daily rounds to offer party\/event clean-up services. But branching out also stops you being too dependent on a single customer, ensures multiple revenue streams, reduces financial risk, and creates more appeal among future customers.<\/p>\n<p>Adding a new service isn\u2019t without it\u2019s challenges, but you can reduce risk by adding a service where minimal know-how is required. Or, if it is, can be quickly acquired.<\/p>\n<p>For example, pest control companies could add another layer of protection to their customer base by offering DIY home security services (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/diy-home-security-roundup\/\">plug and play devices<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are more popular than ever). If you\u2019re a window cleaner, add power washing, gutter cleaning, or painting to your portfolio. Electricians could add smart home technology installations.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself a few questions first:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have the<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\">capital<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to add a new offering to your business?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have or need to hire employees to support the new service?<\/li>\n<li>Could you successfully market these new offerings to new customers?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have the know-how to provide competitive services?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2. Look to Technology to Beat the Competition<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping up with technology when you\u2019re always on the job is hard and it\u2019s easy to fall behind, especially in hands-on, manual trade professions.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few ways to think outside the box and diversify your use of technology:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Become an Online Trusted Advisor<\/span>\u00a0\u2013 Maybe you\u2019re getting questions on social media about your expertise or requests for advice.

QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and many other accounting systems let you do this, and offer mobile apps so your office is always with you.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Online Scheduling <\/span>\u2013 Give your customers the option of scheduling service online.
