They can provide valuable expertise, outside perspectives, connections, tools or a path to success which you just might not have access too. Despite all of the value they can bring to your company, the cost of hiring a consultant is often too expensive for most small businesses to bear.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily there are some simpler ways to get the benefits a consultant can provide. Take a look at our suggestions below\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Send an email to an entrepreneur you admire.<\/strong><br \/>\nMany entrepreneurs remember well the days they were in your shoes and needed similar advice and many of them will happily help you. Tell them about your business and ask a pointed question that you feel deserves their attention. For example: I\u2019m having trouble getting vendors to answer my sales calls? What do you think is the best way to get their attention? You can also ask them how they handled similar situations as well. End your email by asking for a quick 15-minute phone call. Tell them how much it would mean to you and your business to receive their advice. You&#8217;ll be surprised by the response rate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Use online resources such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/\/h\">Quora<\/a>.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe advantage of using an online Q&amp;A board is that it reaches a huge number of people, some of them very well versed in entrepreneurship. Of course this can also result in a lot of \u201cwhite noise\u201d but if you ask a pointed question you will most likely receive great answers. \u00a0Once you&#8217;ve established your online reputation and credentials, you can try to solicit the helpful individuals for additional help and advice offline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Create a board of\u00a0advisers.<\/strong><br \/>\nNetworking is extremely important and you can take it to the next level by curating experts and trusted advisors to become stakeholders in your business. \u00a0For example, If you are a food product business you will want to find people with experience in marketing, sales, and distribution to join your board. Network at events and conferences to build these contacts and develop strong relationships through frequent follow-up and information sharing. You will know when the time is right to ask them to join your board of advisors and don\u2019t forget to reward them if they do add value to your business. Once you have built the board of advisors make sure to keep them updated about your progress. A general rule of thumb is to hold quarterly meetings to engage your advisors and so that they can help drive the direction of your business.
