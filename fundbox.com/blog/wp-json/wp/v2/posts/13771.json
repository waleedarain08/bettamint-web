Build out your site\u2019s SEO and functionality<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving your site\u2019s search engine optimization (SEO) can pay dividends in new leads and conversions. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, however, involves more than plugging in the right keywords. Boosting your site\u2019s visibility means creating a corner of the internet that\u2019s engaging, informative, and easy to read.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, a business website is the most used distribution channel for marketers, according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HubSpot\u2019s 2020 state of marketing report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. People aren\u2019t just looking for information\u2014they\u2019re looking for a better user experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s been a while since you updated your website, consider a refresh. The following steps can help improve functionality and SEO:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hire a web designer to improve your site\u2019s mobile performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number one technical SEO tactic marketers use to improve a business website is optimizing the site for mobile use, according to HubSpot. Making a website <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile-friendly <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comes down to two factors: aesthetics and accessibility. You may need to improve the page loading time, for example, or update the landing page graphics and layout so they translate better to a small screen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revamp your landing page.\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clean, visually compelling landing page can entice potential clients to stick around. Instead of trying to cram in as much information about your firm and services as possible, work on stripping it down to the essentials. Include a brief description of who you are and what you offer, followed by a video or infographic, then a call-to-action that invites people to take advantage of a free phone consultation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add a chatbot.\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chatbot function<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your business\u2019s website is an easy way to draw people in while offering customer service help. You can program chatbots to greet site visitors, answer questions about your firm\u2019s services and fees, and direct them to your contact information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Get press exposure<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appearing in local or national media outlets gives you a chance to establish credibility with current clients, increase brand awareness, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> promote yourself as an authority on a certain subject.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To connect with reporters and writing looking for lawyers to interview, try the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up for email newsletters like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HARO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ProfNet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then set aside 15 minutes each day to read the source requests and respond to journalists.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research local and national news stories that pertain to your field of law. As you read, take note of the reporters and journalists who interview subject matter experts and regularly cover the topics you can speak to.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email reporters with helpful story suggestions or angles. For example, if a local reporter recently wrote a story about small business owners who need to beef up their insurance plans, you could reach out offering insight from a legal perspective.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Increase your content marketing efforts\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a lawyer, your greatest asset is your specialized knowledge. Doling out that knowledge in small\u2014free\u2014bites is a good way to raise brand awareness, attract potential clients, and build credibility with your target clientele.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do you do it?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most successful avenues is content marketing. In fact, 66% of companies surveyed in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-b2b-seo-traffic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2019 HubSpot report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said content marketing was either very or extremely effective for their brand, leading to improved SEO rankings and increased website traffic and subscriber growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can take a variety of forms\u2014including videos, social media, and email\u2014but the most popular tends to be written content. Blogs and articles, for example, are a simple way to educate clients and demonstrate your knowledge, while case studies give potential clients a peek into your process and track record.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are you already do some form of content marketing, but to be successful you have to put your audience\u2019s needs first. What are your clients\u2019 biggest concerns? What are their burning questions? Think about how you can answer their questions or offer guidance through your content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a divorce attorney, for example, you could write a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">series of blog posts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how couples can successfully navigate contentious divorce proceedings. Or, if you advise small businesses, consider writing an ebook that explores how businesses can protect themselves against potential lawsuits during the pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-next-level-content-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">steady revenue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and consistent clients is smart marketing.
