The long-term survival of small businesses is also a worrying stat \u2013 only half of all new establishments survive the first five years or more (Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/FAQ_March_2014_0.pdf\">SBA.gov<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that starting a business is an overwhelming task with lots to do \u2013 writing a business plan, securing financing, bringing in new clients, hiring employees.<\/p>\n<p>But what about the everyday tasks of actually running a business? In the long run, these can shape up to be just as critical as those start-up tasks to ensure business success.<\/p>\n<p>Plan on setting aside 10-15 minutes for each of following daily tasks, and avoid becoming just another small business failure statistic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a01. \u00a0Wrap Your Arms Around Your Financial Dashboards<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is something we preach here at Fundbox regularly. Cash flow is the number one reason businesses fail. Of course, many reasons can contribute to cash flow issues. But staying on top of your finances \u2013 tracking expenses, managing receivables, monitoring actual spend against budget plans, cash flow forecasting, and so on \u2013 can help you spot and act on cash flow issues before they become a problem.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> At a minimum do the following every day:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Check your business bank and credit card accounts everyday (use mobile alerts to get notifications on when certain thresholds such as balance levels or transaction amounts).<\/li>\n<li>Use cloud-based accounting systems such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\">FreshBooks<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xero.com\">Xero<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intuit.com\">Intuit QuickBooks<\/a>, for snapshot dashboard reporting of key financial data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you need a financial safety-net to help you mitigate cash flow issues, consider getting a line of credit or check out Fundbox\u2019s simple way to fix cash flow by advancing payments for outstanding invoices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a02. \u00a0Be a \u201cNoisy Falling Tree.\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\nSure, you need to wine and dine your clients once in a while, but don\u2019t ignore the fundamentals of a good relationship \u2013 responsiveness.<\/p>\n<p>This means answering email and voicemail promptly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong> Instead of keeping your Inbox open all day, set aside 10 minutes each morning, after lunch, and before the close of business to catch up with client-related emails. Even if it\u2019s an \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you with more information later\u2026\u201d type of response.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Work on being a \u201cnoisy falling tree\u201d \u2013 every day.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u00a03. \u00a0Tackle Planning in Manageable Chunks<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is one practice that\u2019s so easy to put off until your mind set is right. But planning (and we don\u2019t mean sitting down to write an encyclopedic document) is something you need to do every day.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Well, obviously planning ensures success. It helps you proactively guide your business where it needs to go. But it also helps you plan for the unexpected. For example, what would happen if you lost a client tomorrow, or a client cuts back on a statement of work by 50% (it happens)? Are you prepared? How can you mitigate the risk of this happening? How would you cope financially and operationally? How will you pay your bills on time and maintain cash flow?<\/p>\n<p>Planning can help you build a picture of what needs to happen to help you get where you want to go while avoiding the pitfalls along the way.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong> <\/em>Use mini-plans to help keep your business moving in the right direction \u2013 one for marketing, one for employees, one for operations, one for networking, and so on. Tackle planning in manageable chunks each day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a04. \u00a0Build That Pipeline<\/strong><br \/>\nSitting on your laurels is not something a small business owner can afford to do any day of the week. As mentioned above, there is no status quo in business. Clients scale back or drop off completely, cash flow can quickly dry up, and before you know it you\u2019re ready to hit the panic button.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to look for ways to build your business every day.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/em> Use your mini business plans to guide your efforts. Networking should certainly be a part of this. Carve out 10 minutes or so each day to look for networking events (attend one a month if you can). Use social media to build connections and share knowledge and information.<\/p>\n<p>Drive deeper relationships with clients \u2013 look at current projects. Take the time to check in and see how things are going. If you\u2019ve just wrapped up a project, see if there are new opportunities or potential case study material that you can draw on.<\/p>\n<p><i>What do you do to productively \u201crun\u201d your business each day?<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>\u00a0<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s a scary statistic, but for every small business that opens in the U.S. each year another one closes.
