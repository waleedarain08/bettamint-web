If you\u2019ve ever applied for a mortgage, credit card, or other personal financing, you\u2019re likely familiar with personal credit reports and scores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many established business owners and new entrepreneurs alike lack that same familiarity with and knowledge of business credit. In fact, some may even be unaware that business credit reports and scores exist at all. Just as a personal credit report reflects your creditworthiness as an individual, a business credit report illustrates the creditworthiness of your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaining a solid knowledge of the information in your business credit reports is paramount to the success of your business, especially because a strong credit rating can boost your borrowing power or even enable you to obtain more favorable financing terms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping on top of your business credit report with regular analysis and monitoring can also help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/small-business\/business-identity-theft\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">avoid fraud<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/small-business\/business-credit-information\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">correct errors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that could keep you from obtaining the funding you need. At the same time, business credit reports differ from personal ones, and can present information and terminology in ways that may be difficult to understand. In this post, we\u2019ll cover:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a business credit report is<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to check your business credit score<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to check your report<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to analyze your business credit report<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you need to understand about it<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you can monitor your business credit<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a business credit report?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business credit report is a document containing background information about your company\u2019s structure, industry, and financial performance. The business credit report generally contains a business\u2019s payment history, past credit inquiries, and information pulled from public records, such as collections, bankruptcies, liens, and other legal judgments filed against the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This report also contains a business credit score, which provides a numerical assessment of your business\u2019s creditworthiness and its handling of money in the past. Lenders, suppliers, customers, and other businesses can check your business credit report and use the information it contains to make decisions about whether to do business with or lend to your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to check your business credit report<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people are hesitant to request a copy of their business credit reports out of concern that doing so might negatively impact their credit score. However, checking your business credit report does not affect your business credit score. This is because checking your own business credit report is considered a soft inquiry. Soft inquiries do not affect your business credit score and are not shared with potential lenders.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three main business credit bureaus that compile business credit reports: Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian Business, and Equifax Business. These bureaus gather information, create business credit reports, and use proprietary scores to evaluate a company\u2019s risk profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your score is then determined by aggregate data the bureau collects from banks, vendors, trade associations, business credit card companies, and sometimes even information you\u2019ve self-reported. Your business credit score can vary from bureau to bureau, so it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check all three.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how:\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dnb.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rates companies on several unique factors that reflect a company\u2019s current and future credit risk. The main rating is the PAYDEX\u00ae score, which measures a business\u2019s payment history on a scale of 1-100. A score of 1\u201349 indicates a high risk of late payment, 50\u201379 indicates moderate risk, and 80\u2013100 represents low risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to get a Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit report<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To view your Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit file, you\u2019ll need the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dnb.com\/products\/small-business\/credit-builder.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CreditBuilder&#x2122; Plus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> product, which costs $149 per month. Signing up includes a D-U-N-S\u00ae Number, which is how Dun &amp; Bradstreet will track your credit history. Along with your full credit file and score, you\u2019ll also be able to add positive payment experiences to your file and dispute inaccurate information that appears on your report.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experian\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experian<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> collects business information, payment history, debt collection history, and financial information to generate a business credit score. Experian\u2019s Credit Ranking Intelliscore ranges from 1 to 100, with 100 being the best score possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to get your Experian business credit score\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can purchase an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.experian.com\/pdp.aspx?pg=products-and-pricing&amp;offercode=EXPSBbcreports-CSR\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experian CreditScore\u2120 Report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for $39.95. However, to get the report that includes tradeline history (a \u201ctradeline\u201d is simply a record of activity for any type of credit extended to your business), you\u2019ll need to upgrade to the ProfilePlus ReportSM for $49.95. They also offer a subscription service that starts at $189 a year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equifax<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.equifax.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equifax<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> uses payment trends, credit history, and public information to determine a business\u2019s creditworthiness. While most credit bureaus will provide you with a single credit score between 1 and 100, an Equifax business credit report provides you with three different scores. The <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payment score<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is your typical credit score. This is a number from 1 to 100, with 100 being the best score.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business credit risk score<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> represents the likelihood of a business being over 90 days late on financial obligations. This score ranges from 101 to 992, with 992 being least likely. A <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business failure score<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> represents whether a business will go bankrupt in the next 12 months. Scores range from 1,000 to 1,610, with 1,610 being least likely.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How to get an Equifax business credit report<\/b><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equifax reports are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.equifax.com\/business\/product\/business-credit-reports-small-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">available on their website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starting at $99.95 per report.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Pricing for Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax credit reports are current as of publish date and are subject to change.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to analyze a business credit report<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the information in your reports should be the same, every bureau organizes it differently. However, any business credit report you obtain will likely contain some or all of the following key components:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Company profile: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is generally a high-level snapshot of your company along with a unique bureau-assigned number that ties the correct business to the information on the report.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Business information:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Depending on the bureau, the report may also include information about your business\u2019s facilities and branches, financial information (including financial statements, if available), and owner(s).<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tradeline payment history:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This section contains your business\u2019s payment history for the last three years. It can include payments to creditors, suppliers, and more. The information supplied in the report ranges from the payment terms, the monthly payment amount, the date of the first report to the credit bureau, and whether the account is current or delinquent.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Public records:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Business credit reports may include publicly available information on both the company and its owner(s).

Both scores reflect any bankruptcies, liens, judgments, on-time payment history, and more. The two scores will also show your 12-month payment trend and compare that to the industry average.

After all, your business credit history and score can play a pivotal role in who you work with and whether or not your business will be approved for loans and other forms of financing in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each business credit bureau calculates credit scores differently, there are a number of factors that generally impact your business credit score. Payment history is among the most significant, as it can indicate how likely you are to make payments, on time, in the future. Other key factors that may impact your business credit score include credit history length, total debt you carry, business industry, and company size.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bottom line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business credit reports and scores are incredibly important if you plan on working with other businesses or borrowing money in the future. However, it\u2019s worth noting here that the importance of your credit score continues to evolve. While many traditional lenders still rely on your business credit to determine whether you\u2019re a responsible borrower, there are alternative lenders, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that also assess metrics beyond your credit score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might include, for example, alternative factors such as your length of time in business, revenue, and industry. So while your credit is important, it\u2019s just one of many factors to keep in mind when planning your financial future. But it\u2019s still best practice to regularly review your reports and scores. Getting into this habit can help you catch fraud, and understanding your credit can take your business further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about credit scores in our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/business-credit-score\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guide to business credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where we give additional advice on how to grow and maintain your credit score.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice.
