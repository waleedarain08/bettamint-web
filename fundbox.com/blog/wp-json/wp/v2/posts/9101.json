All of a sudden, aspiring entrepreneurs who needed cash to turn their ideas into reality could pitch their businesses directly to the public\u2014sidestepping the traditional gatekeepers of small business financing, like banks and venture capitalists.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Established small businesses looking to fund new product development could do the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several noteworthy and successful projects\u2014like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oculus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/money\/business\/businesses-got-start-crowdfunding-kickstarter\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exploding Kittens<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/cameron-albert-deitch\/allbirds-2018-company-of-the-year-nominee.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allbirds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014started out on crowdfunding platforms. On the flip side, untold numbers of campaigns never reach their fundraising goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is crowdfunding right for your small business? Consider these pros and cons to determine whether it makes sense for your specific situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PROS: Reasons to Consider Crowdfunding<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. There\u2019s not much financial risk<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowdfunding enables you to test the waters to see whether your idea has merit without taking on a ton of financial risk. You can test the market and get some reactions before spending money on expensive inventory, materials, or development. That beats funding an unproven business idea out of your own pocket.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your campaign could go viral<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You never know if your campaign will spread quickly across social media, exposing your product to a number of folks you\u2019d be unable to otherwise reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. A successful campaign validates your business idea<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching or exceeding your fundraising goal proves that there\u2019s demand for your product or service. Doubt is removed from the equation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. You keep all of your equity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your campaign succeeds, you\u2019ll have to deliver rewards to your backers\u2014but you won\u2019t have to give up any equity or lose any control of your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. You can tap into an existing community\u2014and build your own<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowdfunding allows you to leverage an engaged community that\u2019s already looking to support ideas like yours. Create a successful campaign and you\u2019ll build a large community of your own. Together, they\u2019ll provide critical feedback you can use to make your idea stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CONS: Reasons to be Cautious With Crowdfunding<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. It takes time and money<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful crowdfunding campaigns require a lot of effort. You\u2019ll likely also have to invest <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/enventyspartners.com\/blog\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-run-a-crowdfunding-campaign\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several thousand dollars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014if not tens of thousands of dollars\u2014to build prototypes, create appealing videos, write persuasive content, and market it all effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Your campaign might not succeed<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than one-third of all crowdfunding campaigns <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/269663\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meet their goals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If yours doesn\u2019t succeed, you may have to deal with some bad press or embarrassment\u2014and you won\u2019t get the time or money you invested back.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Someone could steal your idea<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless your idea is protected\u2014with patents, copyrights, or trademarks\u2014there\u2019s a chance someone could stumble across your campaign and decide to try to mimic what you\u2019re building. Keep your fingers crossed that they can\u2019t build your idea better or faster than you can. Even if you hold a patent or trademark, if your idea is attractive, someone might try to copy you, anyway, and you could be faced with the challenging decision of whether, or how, to fight a legal battle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. You have to pay several fees<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/help\/fees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kickstarter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for example, takes 5% of every successful campaign. Those who meet their goals on the platform will also have to pay credit card companies 3% plus $0.20 on each transaction over $10. If, for example, you raise $100,000 on Kickstarter from 100 people who all put in $1,000, you\u2019d end up with a little less than $92,000 to get to work with. That may not be the worst thing in the world, but it\u2019s something to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s more, folks who pledge less than $10 have to pay a 5% plus $0.05 fee per pledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. It doesn\u2019t work for all businesses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re researching funding for startups, you should know that you may be able to crowdfund enough money to build a consumer-facing product\u2014like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/elanlee\/exploding-kittens\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">card game<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/597538543\/the-worlds-best-travel-jacket-with-15-features-bau?ref=discovery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">jacket<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/getpebble\/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smartwatch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about starting a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/start-catering-business-manage-cash-flow\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">catering<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">painting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> business, you\u2019ll likely have to look elsewhere for capital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowdfunding may be the best path forward for some businesses. Unfortunately, a significant majority of small businesses that go this route never meet their fundraising goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If crowdfunding isn\u2019t right for your company, you\u2019re not out of hope. There are other small business financing mechanisms to choose from. Learn about them in our guide: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Funding, Demystified<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequently asked questions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re reading these words, chances are you\u2019re wondering whether crowdfunding makes sense for your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, it might.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make your decision easier, we\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the more common questions entrepreneurs ask when figuring out how to pay the bills.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. How do I get funding for my startup?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first: Before you look to fund your startup, you first need to determine the type of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/right-entity-for-your-startup\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business entity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019ll be: a sole proprietorship, a limited liability company (LLC), or a corporation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each has their pros and cons, so make sure you do your due diligence so you pick the right one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to funding for startups, many options are available. You could seek out venture capital and angel investors, you could try to raise a seed funding round among friends and family, and you can also try to secure business loans and small business grants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, you could always opt to take out a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or, in the vein of this post, launch a crowdfunding campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Can startups apply for funding?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely. Startups can apply for funding, and many of them do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about applying for funding for your startup, you might want to check out term loans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pro tip: Unless you\u2019re keen on jumping through a number of hoops to see whether you qualify, only to then learn about things like origination fees, application fees, and prepayment penalties, you might be best off looking into alternative lenders that are upfront about fees\u2014like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/term-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That way, you can avoid sticker shock when the ink finally dries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. How do I get free money to start a business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you find some of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecollector.com\/lost-treasures-of-the-world\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lost treasures of the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or secure small business grants, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cfree money.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the very least, you\u2019re putting your own time, energy, and resources into making it all happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, if you\u2019re willing to give up equity in your company, you might be able to secure a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-a-convertible-note\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">convertible note<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in exchange for ownership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how it works: You receive funding from an investor in exchange for a convertible note which then\u2014like the name suggests\u2014\u201cconverts\u201d into shares of preferred stock in the wake of a qualifying event, e.g., a successful Series A round.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. What do startups use funding for?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, startups use funding to grow their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the stage of the company, this might mean hiring on additional workers, opening up new offices, launching aggressive new campaigns, or even acquiring other companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you crowdfund your business, you generally have to offer products or services in exchange for financing. When you secure funding other ways, you usually have more control over where your cash can go.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. How long does it take to get funding for a startup?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your mileage may vary, it can take anywhere between three months and 9 months for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/how-long-does-it-really-take-to-raise-venture-capital-910cebce80cb\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">well-qualified startup<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to secure venture capital financing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Of course, it can take even longer than that, and who knows whether a VC will ever cut you a check at all. (Depending <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-long-does-it-take-to-find-an-investor-for-a-startup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who you ask<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it could even take \u201c10 seconds.\u201d But, let\u2019s face it, ideas like that are few and far between.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A traditional bank might finance your loan in as fast as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alejandrocremades\/2019\/01\/03\/how-long-it-takes-to-raise-capital-for-a-startup\/?sh=78cf328b7a41\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90 days<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But with small business financing rates on the decline, few small business owners have the luxury of twiddling their thumbs for three months, hoping for the best.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast funding for startups: Can you afford to wait to grow your business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you interested in crowdfunding your business or do you want more control over your destiny?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re the only one who knows your goals\u2014and your timetable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re willing to sell equity in your company in exchange for funding\u2014and endure a monthslong process where you hopefully secure VC dollars\u2014then it could make sense to try to track down an angel investor or try to raise a seed round.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if you\u2019re looking to build your business <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, time is of the essence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of waiting weeks or months for funding that may never materialize, you could be better off taking a proactive approach to small business financing and applying for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/term-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">term loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If approved, you\u2019ll have quick access to the money you need to finance your small business\u2014all without having to sell any sliver of the business you\u2019ve worked so hard to build.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for quick, fast funding for startups?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it boils down to it, few entrepreneurs have the resources needed to be picky when it comes to financing their startups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019d rather not wait as long as nine months for financing that may never come through in the first place, we may be able to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information on the easiest way to quickly secure funding for your startup without having to give up control of your business or deliver on crowdfunding promises, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check this out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Crowdfunding has become increasingly popular ever since platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo emerged on the scene` a decade ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":9104,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11532],"yst_prominent_words":[723,1703,1706,2515,6401,1205,1529,8557,4192,712,2041,2308,8556],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"What are the Pros &amp; Cons of Crowdfunding? | Fundbox","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Is crowdfunding right for your small business?
