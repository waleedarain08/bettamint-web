Eligible small business owners and self-employed individuals can now apply for a first-time or second draw PPP loan\u2014through May 31, 2021 or until PPP funds run out. <strong>Fundbox is no longer accepting PPP applications, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/coronavirus-relief-options\/paycheck-protection-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the SBA can help you find a PPP lender<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">. <\/span><\/strong>Some important changes have been made to the PPP, and this article explains the basics of the loan and what\u2019s new or different due to the new law.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While correct to the best of our knowledge at the time of this publication, details shown here may change once the Small Business Administration (SBA) issues further guidance.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>Quick overview of the PPP loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Established to relieve small businesses (including sole proprietors and independent contractors) who have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, the PPP can provide 1% interest loans up to $2 million (the limit used to be $10 million).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculated primarily on your 2019 or 2020 average payroll (based on the year being used to calculate the maximum loan amount) or gross revenue for 2.5 months (or 3.5 months for some industries), these loans are up to 100% forgivable\u2014as long as: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">60% or more of the money is used for employee (or self-employed) compensation;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 40% is used for qualified business costs, and<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other rules including wage and employee retention are followed.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While these PPP basics remain generally the same, the program has been expanded to allow more small businesses to take advantage of the loan, to provide more funding to some of the hardest-hit industries, and to make forgiveness easier. Most of these changes apply retroactively to prior PPP loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Second draw PPP loans now available<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business received a PPP loan in 2020 and have already exhausted that funding, you may be able to apply for second PPP loan if:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business has fewer than 300 employees<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">You have exhausted all funds obtained from a previous PPP loan.

The loan can be for up to, but not exceeding, $2 million.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee earnings calculations still have a $100,000 annual cap, so gross payroll costs are not to exceed $8,333 per month per worker.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>More business types are eligible<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As before, first-time PPP loans are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-01\/Top-line%20Overview%20of%20First%20Draw%20PPP%20%281.8.2021%29-508.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">available for small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with fewer than 500 employees. Also, a small business can only qualify if it has a maximum tangible net worth of under $15 million and the average net income for full 2 fiscal years prior to application does not exceed $5 million. If you are a publicly traded company, you are prohibited from receiving a loan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>With the new law, there are now some exceptions to these special size rules that may still make you eligible:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are in the accommodation and food services sector (NAICS 72), the 500-employee limit is applied on a per physical location basis<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are operating as a franchise or receive financial assistance from an approved Small Business Investment Company the normal affiliation rules do not apply\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses that have minority shareholders (private equity or venture capital) can still qualify if those shareholders relinquish rights<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most of the usual SBA exclusions of eligible business types remain, the new law expands the categories of businesses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/SBA%20Form%202234C%20app.%204-23-14_working.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who can apply<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a PPP loan. For example, the PPP now invites small nonprofits, local newspapers, and TV and radio broadcasters.

Another $15 billion is set aside for employers with 10 or fewer employees or for loans less than $250,000 for entities located in a low-income neighborhood.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Broader, simpler loan forgiveness<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBA will forgive 100% of the loan as long as you use at least 60% of the money for payroll costs within a period of 8 weeks or 24 weeks\u2014beginning on the day the PPP funds were deposited in your business bank account. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ppp-loan-forgiveness\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To qualify for full forgiveness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the remaining loan funds (up to 40%) must be spent on eligible non-payroll business costs. The changes listed below are retroactive to prior or current PPP loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here\u2019s what\u2019s new when it comes to PPP loan forgiveness:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>You can choose either 8-weeks or 24-weeks<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the covered period on which to base your forgiveness calculation (including previous PPP loan recipients).
