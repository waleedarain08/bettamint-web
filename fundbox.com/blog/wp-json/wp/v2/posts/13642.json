It&#8217;s<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/smbs\/2019\/fundbox-business-trade-credit-b2b-payment-platforms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimated that $3.1 trillion<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in receivables is owed to U.S. firms on any given day. The problem gets even worse when companies pay late. Improving cash flow is especially important during the COVID-19 economy. This need for quick cash has led many small businesses to consider invoice factoring \u2014 selling accounts receivable to an invoice factoring company at a discount, plus a fee. Besides being expensive, invoice factoring comes with other risks to your business. Here&#8217;s how factoring works, and how a line of credit may be a better alternative.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factoring is ancient history<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Merchants and traders have been using a form of factoring since about 1754 B.C.E. (before the common era) in ancient Babylon, as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.history.com\/topics\/ancient-history\/hammurabi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spelled out in the Code of Hammurabi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a giant, black stone pillar detailing 282 rules governing commercial interactions, including establishing proper conduct, fines, and even eye-for-an-eye punishments. As early as 2000 years ago, Romans were believed to sell discounted promissory notes and hire third parties to settle their trade debts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h6><\/h6>\n<h6><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-13652\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg\" alt=\"code of Hammurabi\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Code-of-Hammurabi.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Code-of-Hammurabi-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><br \/>\n<em>A closeup of the text of the Code of Hammurabi written in stone.<\/em><\/h6>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice factoring, as a practice by name, began in England before the year 1400. Pilgrims brought it to America around 1620. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.openbusinesscouncil.org\/the-history-of-invoice-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English common law required<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that if a merchant wanted to sell invoices to a third-party for factoring, the debtor had to be notified. However, that requirement had fallen away by 1949, when most state governments in the U.S. had adopted rules so that merchants could make factoring arrangements without notifying the debtor.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why businesses use factoring<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that factoring has been a common B2B practice for more than 3,700 years means that it has to be good for something, right? Basically, it&#8217;s a way for small businesses to get cash sooner instead of waiting around for their clients to pay on net terms, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-handle-late-paying-customers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay past due<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or not at all. It also frees a company&#8217;s staff from the stress and workload of following up on collections. Understandably, however, this convenience comes at a price.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hard and hidden costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice factoring brings several disadvantages to the businesses who use it. It can be much more expensive than other types of funding \u2014 taking a large chunk out of your profits \u2014 and it may even face you with other issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The cost.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The discount rate (or factor rate), depending on the factoring period, could range from 2% to 10% of the invoice. Plus, you may have to pay service fees, origination fees, credit check fees, or other fees added by the factoring company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The customer impression.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some factoring companies may issue a Notice of Assignment and verify your invoices with the debtor. If this happens, your customers may question the stability of your business, since turning to factoring is often a tell-tale sign of cash flow problems, so they may consider switching to your competitor.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The contracts.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some factoring companies require long-term contracts, forcing you to sign over a majority of your invoices, rather than just filling a short-term cash crunch.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The control over your business<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To reduce their risk from customers who are likely to default, some factoring companies may even prevent you from working with specific accounts you had previously built relationships with.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A better way to maintain cash flow while waiting to get paid<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses have more options than factoring to avoid the cash flow problems of delayed payments, even in situations where you can&#8217;t ask your customers to pay by credit card. A <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business line of credit from Fundbox<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can provide you with the financial breathing room to keep your operations going despite the peaks and valleys of irregular working capital that may come even when facing irregular payment on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">receivables<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Best of all, this comes without your business having to offer a discount on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> payment, sell your invoices at a loss, or sacrifice your control or reputation with your valuable customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is for informational purposes only.
