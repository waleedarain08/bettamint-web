It reports all the cash generated and used by your company during a given period. Today, we\u2019ll take a look at the important role that the balance sheet plays in your small business accounting. We\u2019ll focus on the operating, financing, and investing activities that make up your balance sheet.<\/p>\n<h2>Operating Activities<\/h2>\n<p>This section of the balance sheet reports your company\u2019s net income, converting it from accrual to cash basis. It does this by analyzing the changes in your <a title=\"The Accounting Equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity\" href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/assets-liabilities-equity\/\">current assets and liabilities<\/a>. Fields that will be found in this section include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accounts Receivable<\/strong> \u2013 An asset attained by selling goods or services on credit (i.e. not a cash sale). This is often seen in contracts that indicate payment is due upon receipt of a service +30 days.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inventory<\/strong> \u2013 A current asset that can be sold for revenue. The best example of this is a grocery store\u2019s <a title=\"How to Optimize Your Inventory Costs\" href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/optimize-inventory-costs\/\">inventory<\/a>. The price of a gallon of milk should factor in the cost of acquiring it, storing it, and staff necessary to prepare the milk for sale (placing it on the shelf).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Supplies<\/strong> \u2013 A current asset that indicates the cost of supplies currently in stock.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prepaid Insurance<\/strong> \u2013 This refers to insurance premiums that have been paid in advance for a given period extending beyond the period of the balance sheet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accounts Payable<\/strong> \u2013 Accounts payable represent the amount your company owes for items and services purchased on credit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wages Payable<\/strong> \u2013 Wages payable are a current liability that indicate how much is owed to employees for hours worked that have not yet been compensated. This includes taxes that have been levied but not paid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Income Taxes Payable<\/strong> \u2013 This is a current liability that reflects the amount of income taxes owed to local, state, and federal governments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unearned Revenues<\/strong> \u2013 This is a liability that reports payment received in advance of providing goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to assessing current assets and liabilities, this section makes adjustments for depreciation (which we will be discussing next week) on long-term assets.<\/p>\n<h2>Financing Activities<\/h2>\n<p>This section of your balance sheet looks at the changes in balances for long-term liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity accounts. Essentially, it reports the issuance and\/or repurchase of the company\u2019s stocks and bond as well as short and long-term borrowings and repayments. Balances recorded in this section include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notes and Bonds Payable<\/strong> \u2013 This is a long-term liability that includes any bank loans our outstanding bonds that have been issued to the company and have not yet been paid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deferred Income Taxes<\/strong> \u2013 This represents the difference between the income tax expense associated with revenues and expenses reported on the business\u2019 income statements and the actual income from a tax return.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Preferred, Common, or Treasury Stocks<\/strong> \u2013 Stocks refer to ownership of shares (common stock) in a business or corporation. Different classes of stocks will determine how shareholders can turn a profit. Preferred stockholders, for example, will be paid in dividends and typically do not share in the company\u2019s earnings. Treasury stock refers to the company\u2019s stock that has been repurchased from shareholders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retained Earnings<\/strong> \u2013 This refers to a shareholder\u2019s equity account and reports the net income of the corporation from its start to the current date. It should be noted that dividends are typically excluded from this sum.<\/p>\n<h2>Investing Activities<\/h2>\n<p>While financing activities look at <a title=\"The Accounting Equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity\" href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/assets-liabilities-equity\/\">long-term liabilities<\/a>, investing activities consider long-term assets. This section looks at the purchase or sale of long-term investments, property, equipment, and more. Long-term assets include:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Property<\/strong> \u2013 This refers to any land or buildings that have been purchased by and for the company. Land is generally the first asset listed under investing activities and is not generally subjected to depreciation. Buildings, on the other hand, are recorded minus the cost of the land and are depreciated based on their useful lifetime.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vehicles, Furniture &amp; Equipment<\/strong> \u2013 Large-ticket items are long-term assets that are classified on the balance sheet as property, plant, and equipment. With an exception of land, all such assets are subject to depreciation.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for our post next week that will walk you through the steps to <a title=\"Fundbox Blog\" href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\">calculate asset depreciation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week, we introduced the cash flow statement as one of the key financial statements that your company will produce. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":16443,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232],"yst_prominent_words":[2701,2637,2656,3896,1148,2305,3893,3899,3900,3895,2591,3894,3892,3897,3891,3898,1424,3901,3902],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"yes","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Understanding Your Balance Sheet","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"The balance sheet plays an important role in your small business accounting.
