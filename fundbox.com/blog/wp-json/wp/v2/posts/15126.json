In fact, employees who feel like they can be their authentic selves on the job are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/content\/dam\/web\/en_us\/www\/assets\/pdf\/datasheets\/salesforce-research-2017-workplace-equality-and-values-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.4 times more likely to perform their best work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to Salesforce\u2019s 2017 Workplace Equality and Values Report.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when employees are engaged at work and invested in your company\u2019s success, your entire business benefits. A 2018 Gallup poll found that businesses with employees in the top quartile of engagement have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/241649\/employee-engagement-rise.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21% higher profitability than those in the bottom quartile<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Here are eight powerful <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee appreciation ideas<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get started:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Survey your employees<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step to taking better care of your employees is figuring out what they want. Consider sending out an anonymous email survey to your employees asking for their candid feedback on your company\u2019s benefits, workplace culture, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opportunities, schedule, and management.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, you can review the data and look for patterns or problem areas. For example, maybe your employees are content with their salaries but want more autonomy at work. Or perhaps you\u2019re noticing a lot of complaints around health insurance, but positive responses around the collaborative company culture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surveying your employees can help you identify issues and formulate a plan to address them. Don\u2019t forget to follow up with your employees. In addition to executing changes, check in with them every month or quarter to see how they\u2019re doing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Invest in employee recognition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee recognition is essential to employee satisfaction. Eighty-two percent of employees in a 2019 Bonusly survey said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.surveymonkey.com\/curiosity\/employee-recognition-and-retention\/?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they\u2019re happier at work when they\u2019re recognized<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When employees are happy, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retention rates go up<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. According to the same survey, 63% of employees who were regularly recognized at work said they were unlikely to look for a new job, whereas 43% of employees who were never or rarely recognized said they were extremely likely to seek out work elsewhere.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acknowledging your employees doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. You can praise someone\u2019s work during a company-wide meeting, deliver a handwritten thank you note for a job well done, or give your employees a half day off after a particularly hectic month or quarter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ideas include celebrating your employees\u2019 work anniversaries, handing out annual bonuses, and acknowledging important life milestones with balloons or a card. You could even create a peer-to-peer recognition program where you encourage employees to nominate each other for a monthly or quarterly employee appreciation reward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Offer flexible work hours<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/moving-business-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">businesses move online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, employees are craving flexible work hours. In a 2019 survey from FlexJobs, 72% of workers said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/survey-flexible-work-job-choices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a flexible schedule is their second most desired work option<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> behind full-time remote work. Giving your employees more autonomy and flexibility over their work schedule can improve their happiness <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> potentially <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-ways-to-boost-summertime-employee-productivity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase their productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your business, you could offer extended working hours throughout the day to accommodate differences in schedules, take individual preferences into account when assigning shifts, or give your employees the option to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/employees-love-working-remotely-is-it-good-for-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work remotely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> one or two days a week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Expand your employee wellness resources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting your employees\u2019 health is a long-term investment in your business\u2019s success. Seventy-nine percent of employees surveyed in Perkbox\u2019s 2020 workplace stress report said they <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.personneltoday.com\/hr\/just-1-never-experience-work-related-stress-finds-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regularly deal with work-related stress<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And it\u2019s only gotten worse over the past year. Sixty-seven percent of employees surveyed said they\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.metlife.com\/content\/dam\/metlifecom\/us\/ebts\/pdf\/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more stressed now than before the pandemic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to the MetLife Employee Benefits Trends Study 2020.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to providing comprehensive health coverage, consider what else you can do to support your employees\u2019 overall wellbeing. Maybe you could offer your employees a monthly health and wellness stipend to use on virtual fitness classes, workout equipment, therapy, books, or spa treatments. Or maybe you can partner with another company to offer discounted or free yoga classes or guided meditations to your employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Provide regular feedback<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving your employees regular feedback on their work can help them stay engaged and accountable. Without consistent feedback or guidance, they might feel lost, overwhelmed, or undervalued at work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to delivering feedback during annual performance reviews, start scheduling weekly or monthly one-on-one <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/3-tips-run-great-meeting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meetings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to check in with your employees, praise them for their excellent work, and offer suggestions or guidance for what they can improve upon.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also helpful to share feedback as it comes up organically. If an employee gives a good presentation, for example, or takes exceptional care of a customer, take the time to acknowledge their efforts in the moment. On the other hand, if an employee botches a client call or shows up late to a shift, you may want to pull them aside right away for a chat. Just make sure you deliver your constructive criticism with discretion and compassion.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Offer childcare help or family assistance\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Showing your employees you appreciate them isn\u2019t just about praising them at work\u2014it\u2019s also about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/3-ways-to-put-your-employees-first\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making their personal lives easier<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and more enjoyable. One of the best ways to do that is by offering family assistance. Giving your employees the tools to better support their loved ones can reduce their stress and help them stay engaged at work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the MetLife study, 69% of employees surveyed said they would appreciate the option to have subsidized care for their family. That could be help with childcare, pet care, or in-home care for ill or disabled family members. Sit down with your HR director to review your company\u2019s health insurance package and see where you could offer assistance, whether it\u2019s a stipend for daycare or paid leave for family care.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Enhance your extras<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/awesome-employee-perks-to-consider\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work perks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and exciting benefits can go a long way toward making your employees feel supported, especially <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/management-during-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the pandemic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even small gestures of thoughtfulness can make employees feel seen and valued.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your employees work from home, you could send them care packages for holidays or give them gift cards to order groceries or buy take-out meals. You could also offer entertainment stipends, paid lunches, productivity supplies, or <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee appreciation gifts<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like reusable water bottles and cozy blankets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Support personal development and growth<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great way to show your employees appreciation is to invest in their personal and professional growth. Sixty-five percent of employees surveyed in the MetLife study said they\u2019re interested in professional development reimbursements as a work benefit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an employer, it\u2019s a win\/win. When you support your employees in achieving their goals, not only do you make them happy, you also reap the benefits of their growth and skills. To start, consider sponsoring a course or program for your employees. They might want to undergo leadership training or take a class that teaches a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specialized skill<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like coding or copywriting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appreciation goes far<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/celebrate-employee-appreciation-day\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee appreciation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> translates to company success. Instead of putting your employee appreciation efforts on the back burner, make it a priority to treat your employees to something special and acknowledge their hard work. Your business will be better for it in the long run. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If your customers are the fuel that propels your business forward, your employees are the engine.
