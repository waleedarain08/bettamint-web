We\u2019ve spoken with lots of owners who dislike using personal credit for their business because it prevents them from separating personal and business finances, and because using their personal credit can hurt their credit scores.<\/p>\n<p>Direct Draw is a revolving line of credit for small businesses with limits up to $100,000. What makes it special is the way we make credit decisions by reviewing your bank transactions. You simply connect your business bank account and we automatically review your transactions to assess the health of your business. If approved, you can click to draw funds anytime and repay us over 12 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what the Direct Draw dashboard looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7845\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Fundbox_Small_Business_Credit_with_Direct_Draw.png\" alt=\"Fundbox Business Line of Credit\" width=\"1299\" height=\"809\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Fundbox_Small_Business_Credit_with_Direct_Draw.png 1299w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Fundbox_Small_Business_Credit_with_Direct_Draw-768x478.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1299px) 100vw, 1299px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Direct Draw has a clean design that lets you draw any amount up to your credit limit.
