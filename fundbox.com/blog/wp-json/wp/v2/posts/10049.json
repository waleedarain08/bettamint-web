Then do some research:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is that market growing or shrinking?<\/li>\n<li>What type of demand exists for your product in the country?<\/li>\n<li>How much competition is there for your product?<\/li>\n<li>What&#8217;s involved in shipping products to that country? How far away is it and what is the infrastructure like? What types of tariffs, shipping laws and other import-export regulations will affect your profit margin?<\/li>\n<li>How similar is the country to the United States in terms of attitude, culture, business norms and language?<\/li>\n<li>What types of legal protection exists for foreign companies?<\/li>\n<li>Do you have existing contacts or prior experience that will make it easier to start exporting to that country? If not, can you find a foreign partner in the country to help?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified the country you want to export to, look for potential customers in your chosen country.<\/p>\n<p>Trade shows, networking, industry contacts and online directories are all potential sources of customers. (Check out the resources at the end of this post for more help finding customers overseas.)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Plan for logistics.<\/span>\u00a0How will you get your product overseas? International shipping is complex business, involving customs, duties, taxes and clearance. Using a freight forwarder can save you time and reduce errors. Freight forwarders manage all your shipping needs, such as obtaining insurance, licenses and permits, dealing with customs and more.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Figure out how you\u2019ll handle payments.<\/span>\u00a0Of course, you\u2019d like to get paid as soon as your customer receives your shipment (or even before), but they may not be so agreeable. Talk to your accountant and business bank to get advice on how to safely handle international payments and what types of payment terms to offer.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Plan for financing<\/span>. Before you start exporting, create financial and sales projections and use them to assess your capital needs. Have adequate financial resources to meet those needs\u2014plus a cushion\u2014before you start. If you get a big order but don&#8217;t have the working capital to finance buying or manufacturing the products, your global expansion might end before it begins.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tap experts in your network for help.<\/span>\u00a0Talk to your financial advisor about possible financing methods, and consider looking into alternative sources of capital. Fundbox offers a variety of financing options suited for exporters, including a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\">business line of credit<\/a><\/span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/purchase-order-financing\/\">purchase order financing<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fundbox Pay<\/span>\u00a0for accelerating payments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How to Start Importing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Importing gives U.S. distributors access to unique products that don\u2019t exist in the States, as well as low-cost products for resale, such as cell phone accessories.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Get familiar with the market.<\/span>\u00a0To find potential products you can import, attend trade shows featuring international exhibitors, or visit websites that match overseas suppliers with importers. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.alibaba.com\/\">Alibaba<\/a><\/span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalsources.com\/\">Global Sources<\/a><\/span>, and the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thomasnet.com\/\">Thomas Register<\/a><\/span>\u00a0are three well-known marketplaces for international sourcing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Do deeper research.<\/span>\u00a0Once you\u2019ve found some potential suppliers, take your time and do some research before choosing the right one for you. Start by researching the suppliers\u2019 countries. You may want to avoid countries with unstable political climates, which could make it hard to get products out of the country, or fluctuating currencies, which could affect your costs.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Factor in all the fees.<\/span>\u00a0Before you choose, you should also find out what trade restrictions, taxes, license or permit requirements, customs fees, and insurance coverage would be involved with importing from that country. Then, factor those costs into your pricing and margins to avoid surprises later.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Next, do your due diligence on the supplier itself.<\/span>\u00a0Can they keep up with demand? Are they reliable? Talk to their past customers (not just the references they give you). Visit online industry discussion groups, search for online reviews or comments, and reach out to your social media connections to get insights into the company. Finally, ask to see sample products so you can assess product quality in person before you place an order.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Finally, tackle the paperwork.<\/span>\u00a0A customs broker may be able to help you manage the logistics of receiving shipments, dealing with paperwork, and inspecting shipments at the port or airport. (You don\u2019t want to wait until a shipment arrives at your business to discover the product is damaged or the supplier sent the wrong item.)<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re based in the U.S., your contract should specify that you will pay in U.S. currency. This protects you from currency fluctuation in the other country. Talk to your business bank to see what types of foreign payment tools they offer. Your financial advisor, accountant, or banker should be able to guide you to the best way to handle international payments with minimal risk.<\/p>\n<p>Overseas suppliers want to get paid as quickly as possible, but as a distributor, you\u2019ll have to wait 30 days, 90 days or more for your customers to pay you. To ensure you have adequate working capital during this lag time, prepare in advance by investigating potential financing sources. For example, with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fundbox Pay<\/span>\u00a0your suppliers get paid immediately while you still have 30, 60 or more days to pay. Other options include a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\">business line of credit<\/a><\/span>\u00a0or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/purchase-order-financing\/\">purchase order financing<\/a><\/span>\u00a0from Fundbox.<\/p>\n<h2>More h<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">elp is out there<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Both exporting and importing can involve a lot of paperwork, preparation, and bureaucracy, so it&#8217;s wise to get advice from experts.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that you start by finding an attorney and accountant who are familiar with global trade and your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Next, visit <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.export.gov\/welcome\">Export.gov<\/a><\/span>, a comprehensive website that covers everything you need to know about exporting overseas.
