Perhaps more importantly, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/instagram-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">81% of Instagram <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">users<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (meaning consumers with personal Instagram accounts) turn to the platform for information on products and services before making a purchase<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This includes everything from doing research on products and services to getting the particulars on promotions and sales to finding links to websites and contact information. All add up to a potential goldmine for small business owners interested in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">updating their digital marketing campaigns<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proven e-commerce strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply being on Instagram (e.g. signing up for an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram business account<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) isn\u2019t going to get you very far, though. You need to actually use it in a way that will pay off. How can you do this? Multiple factors are involved, but one of the most important factors involves your followers. Not only <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is following you (although that can be important, too), but how <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">many<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are following you as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does it matter? That\u2019s because followers beget <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">followers, along with more shares, more visibility and ultimately (hopefully!) more sales. Learning how to gather followers isn\u2019t necessarily instinctive, but once you know the ropes it will feel like second nature. Do you have just a handful of followers, or are you working with a sizable list of actively engaged folks who regularly view your posts?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is the former, here are four actions you can take now to increase the number of your small business\u2019s Instagram followers:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Use hashtags strategically and effectively<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hashtag may appear to be nothing other than a random word or phrase with a pound sign in front of it. In reality, hashtags are your business\u2019s best friend\u2014at least in terms of getting an influx of Instagram followers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the purpose of hashtags?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hashtags provide a chance to connect your business to a cause relevant to your brand, a promotional opportunity or a trending topic by catapulting a post into the search results related to said hashtags so your business is easier to find (the sheer volume of content on Instagram means a lot of great posts get buried without them). When an Instagram user enters a search term preceded by a hashtag into the search field, posts that include that hashtag will appear (coffee connoisseurs may search for #espresso, whereas someone planning a vacation may search for #travel).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business owner, you can research hashtags that apply to your business and include them in your Instagram posts to increase the potential for views, likes and additional followers (examples include hashtags like #nationalsmallbusinessweek or #smallbusiness). You can also create custom hashtags for special events (like a seasonal sale), and advise customers to search for and follow those hashtags on Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many hashtags should you use?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of hashtags you use in a post is all up to you, and that decision will depend greatly on the hashtag protocols in your industry. Instagram\u2019s hashtag limit is 30 per post. You certainly don\u2019t need to take it that far if you don\u2019t want to, but you may want to consider using at least one\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/instagram-stats-every-marketer-should-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data supports the idea that posts with hashtags receive more consumer engagement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than those without. The sweet spot? Around five hashtags per post.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip: To help establish brand recognition, create a hashtag specific to your business name and\/or brand and encourage followers to use it when mentioning your business in posts.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Invest in Instagram ads<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve never considered capitalizing on the power of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram advertising<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, now may be the time to give it a try if one of your objectives is to gain more followers. Often more affordable than traditional forms of advertising, like radio or print, Instagram offers a lot of flexibility in terms of how you format your ad. You can take an existing post and morph it into an ad, you can produce ads in Instagram Stories, you can create shoppable posts and so on. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webfx.com\/how-much-does-social-media-advertising-cost.html#instagram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost to you, as the advertiser, is click- or impression-based and varies a lot depending on several factors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do ads help increase your follower count? Instagram uses algorithms and data to target folks who show interest in products or services like yours, even if they aren\u2019t already following you. As they scroll, your ad appears. Not all will follow you but, thanks to targeting, some probably will.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>Tip: Another advertising option?<\/i> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/adespresso.com\/blog\/instagram-sponsored-posts\/#:~:text=An%20Instagram%20sponsored%20post%20is,account%20for%20a%20lucrative%20career.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponsored posts<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This involves partnering with (i.e. paying) an influencer to promote your products or services in their own posts or stories. Because their followers presumably consider them a credible source, their endorsement may result in more followers for you.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Host contests and giveaways<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram users love contests and giveaways and, as a small business with an Instagram business account, it may be worth your time to sponsor one. Why? Because a contest\/giveaway provides an opportunity to quickly and easily gain followers. Contests and giveaways also allow you to engage with your current followers in a way that encourages them to help you spread the word about your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting one up isn\u2019t hard. It all starts with determining what it is you want to give away and setting contest parameters (be aware that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/instagram\/179379842258600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram has several rules about contests<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you\u2019ll need to adhere to). Since your goal is to gain followers, however, you\u2019ll want to make sure that those parameters help get you there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few ideas:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encourage followers to tag a friend for an additional contest entry.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the contest open to followers only.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaborate on the contest with another business or influence (cross promotion for the win).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Engage with followers (and potential followers)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you do this yourself, maybe you hire a social media manager to do it or maybe you assign the task to an employee. In any case, one of the best ways to increase your Instagram following is to actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Instagram as the communication tool that it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This starts, of course, with posting regularly, but it doesn\u2019t end there. You also need to make sure your followers know you actually see and hear them.
