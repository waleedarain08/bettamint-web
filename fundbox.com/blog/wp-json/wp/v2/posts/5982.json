By understanding how working capital financing is used by construction business owners, you can learn more about working capital financing, who is it for and how it can be used to help grow faster and mitigate risk in your own business.<\/p>\n<p>As an owner of a construction business, there are many situations where you might need working capital financing.<\/p>\n<h2>What is working capital?<\/h2>\n<p>Essentially, \u201cworking capital\u201d is the amount of liquid assets you have available to handle day-to-day expenses\u2014and almost every entrepreneur experiences a time when that capital just isn\u2019t enough to cover them. Construction and contracting businesses are unique in that they usually require a significant outlay of cash at each stage of each job, requiring a substantial amount of working capital in the bank.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8295 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/shutterstock_323699144.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"937\" height=\"622\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No matter how successful your construction business, you may need working capital financing in situations like these:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 16px;\"><b>Big work orders: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You receive a big new job or large work order from an important client, but won\u2019t be paid until the job is complete. However, you need working capital to buy the building materials or equipment to fulfill the order.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 16px;\"><b>Expansion and growth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You\u2019re planning to expand your construction business. Whether you are hiring additional employees, expanding to a new geographic or demographic market, or moving to a bigger physical location, business growth \u00a0requires additional working capital.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 16px;\"><b>Seasonal slumps:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Winter time hits! Depending on your location, the construction business can be highly seasonal. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400; padding-bottom: 16px;\"><b>Slow payments:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Clients are slow to pay their invoices. \u00a0If a big client is slow to pay or you face unexpected delays in processing invoices, working capital financing can help get you over the hump until you get paid and your cash flow is back to normal.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8296 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/shutterstock_546792511.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"672\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where to Get Working Capital Financing for Your Construction Company<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have many options for working capital financing to improve cash flow for your construction business. Here are some to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Term loans<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When most people think of business financing, they think of term loans. These loans are made for a specific period of time or \u201cterm\u201d\u2014hence the name. You can choose from short-term loans, which typically require repayment within 18 months, or longer-term loans, which may have repayment periods of up to 10 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Term loans are useful if you require a substantial amount of working capital financing, but they can be difficult to obtain. Term loans require a thorough application, including a review of your personal credit score, your business credit history, business and personal tax returns and more.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Line of credit<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever gotten a home equity line of credit on your house, you\u2019re familiar with the concept of a line of credit. A business line of credit works the same way: The lender approves you for a certain amount of credit, which you can draw upon when you need it. You don\u2019t incur interest charges or need to make payments until you actually draw from the credit line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business line of credit is a very attractive and flexible solution for working capital financing needs. However, banks may see the construction industry as \u201crisky\u201d and are often hesitant to extend lines of credit to construction businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8297 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/shutterstock_653917444.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1040\" height=\"693\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>Credit card financing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the limits of your business credit cards and the amount of working capital you need, a business credit card can be an easy solution\u00a0to your problems. If you already have the card, there\u2019s no need to apply for anything, and you can pay off the balance in amounts that work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the downside is high interest rates and the possibility of additional fees (and damage to your credit rating) if you miss a payment. Since construction jobs require you to pay suppliers and vendors before getting paid yourself, you\u2019ll want to make sure the timing works out. You will want to pay off your cards before incurring large financing charges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8301\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/shutterstock_609304082.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1154\" height=\"769\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Invoice financing<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this type of working capital financing, a lender gives you an advance on your outstanding invoices so you don\u2019t have to wait for customers to pay you. This solves the problem of slow-paying clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invoice financing is similar to invoice factoring, but there are some important differences. For instance, if you use Fundbox\u2019s invoice financing services, you receive 100% of the amount of your invoices, while factoring companies typically advance just a percentage of your invoice amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox won\u2019t interfere in your relationship with your clients, so they\u2019ll never know you\u2019re using a financing solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fundbox, you get your money immediately (typically as soon as the next business day), and repay the advance over a 12-week or 24-week period\u2014your choice. You can even pay it back early without any penalties if you want to. There\u2019s no complicated application to complete\u2014just sign up for a free Fundbox account and connect your accounting software. Once you\u2019re approved, just choose the invoices you want to advance, and you\u2019re all set.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working Capital Financing For various reasons, which we will review in this article, the Construction industry serves as a great &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":6241,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11532,426],"yst_prominent_words":[2722,2718,723,1721,1706,1844,2542,922,1239,739,989,753,1529,3161,2725,2724,2721,1522,1682,2541],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Working Capital Financing Solutions for Small Businesses","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Working capital financing is financing for your business day-to-day expenses.
