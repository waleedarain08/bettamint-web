Here are 12 ways your small business can monopolize on Black Friday, the day after (aka Small Business Saturday), into Cyber Monday, and beyond.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Chill out!<\/strong> Invite customers to your store or business for a post-Black Friday chill out event \u2013 bring in wine, offer free chair massages, and coupons that can be redeemed before December 25<sup>th<\/sup>. You get the picture.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Take part in <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/us\/small-business\/shop-small\/about\/?linknav=us-loy-nav-aboutshopsmall\"><strong>Small Business Saturday<\/strong><\/a> on the day after Black Friday (November 28) even better rally your neighborhood to get involved.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>If you\u2019re a B2B business.<\/strong> Offer a special promotion immediately after the holidays (everyone is too busy getting ready for Thanksgiving the few days prior).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Team up with other businesses<\/strong> and host a sidewalk sale or holiday-themed festival. Print out a combined flyer with everyone\u2019s discount or coupon listed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Hold a special door buster sale for your best customers<\/strong> (outside of normal business hours).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Create a holiday gift guide and promote it online and in-store. <\/strong>Whether it\u2019s \u201c10 Gifts for Under $25\u201d or \u201c10 Ways We Can Help Get you Through the Holidays\u201d. Create a flyer with images of your products or services and get it out there.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Make it about charity. <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.givingtuesday.org\/\">#GivingTuesday<\/a> falls on the first Tuesday after Black Friday (December 1<sup>st<\/sup> this year). Consider hosting a customer appreciation event. Include a raffle or prize draw giving all the donations to your charity of choice. Or, you could donate a portion of your profits on that day to charity \u2013 just make sure you promote what you\u2019re doing over email, social media, and in-person.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Make it about family.<\/strong> Keep the holiday theme going by attracting families. Even if kids aren\u2019t your target audience, make a kid-friendly space for them in your store or entice kids and their parents in with free cookies beverages or entertainment, like face painting.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Stagger your promotions.<\/strong> Think like a big box store offering time-bound promotions on select merchandise \u201c25% off through midday\u201d. Then in the afternoon offer a gift with every purchase over $X or a two-for-one sale on certain lines (focus on items that complement each other).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Offer social media-only specials.<\/strong> Consider posting specials that are targeted at your social followers only. Provide a unique coupon code or link to a printable or mobile-friendly offer on your site (one that\u2019s only accessible to those with the link). Remember to use the right hashtags too: #BlackFriday, #SmallBusinessSaturday, #SmallBizSat, #cybermonday and #ShopLocal.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><strong>Dress up your storefront.<\/strong> Don\u2019t just promote the heck out of everything online, make sure everyone who walks or drives by knows that you\u2019ve got a sale or event coming up. Same goes for merchandising, get in the holiday spirit with seasonal items and decorations.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li><strong>Offer the convenience of extending your offers beyond Black Friday<\/strong> (or Small Business Saturday). Take the pressure off your customers by giving them the flexibility to buy into an offer now, but make the purchasing decision later. For example, you could offer gift cards at a discount ($100 for $75) that must be purchased on that day, but can be redeemed anytime in the next 12 months.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Happy selling!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Black Friday isn\u2019t traditionally a day when we think about small businesses, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get in &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3525,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10158,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[5766,5764,723,2503,5768,5770,798,5769,2170,5765,5357,1663,1030,4638,3912,2513,712,2502,804,5767],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"12 Marketing Ideas for Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Black Friday isn\u2019t traditionally a day when we think about small businesses, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get in on the act.
