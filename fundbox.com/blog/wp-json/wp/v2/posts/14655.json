Small business owners, on the other hand, eagerly await the Saturday in between those days.<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Small Business Saturday<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows consumers to support small businesses during a time of year when many could benefit from a little extra support. Their deals may not be as flashy as your favorite big-box retailers, but shopping small can have a huge impact on a small business\u2014especially amidst a pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is Small Business Saturday?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, during the Great Recession, American Express created a campaign designed to help support the small businesses that are such vital parts of our communities. The campaign created a movement called<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/us\/small-business\/shop-small\/about\/?linknav=us-loy-shopsmall-footer-about\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Saturday<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the campaign encouraged consumers to focus on shopping small while checking off their holiday gift list. The cause was celebrated by shoppers and small business owners alike, and 12 years later, the movement is still going strong.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every year, small business owners open their shops and drive traffic to their websites by offering deals on both products and services that make great holiday gifts. Some neighborhood small businesses band together to create events surrounding their sales, and others run online promotions so you can shop your favorite small businesses from the comfort of your home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 40px;\">Why Shop Small Business Saturday?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the internet, you can now shop with small businesses regardless of your location, but one of the main purposes of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Saturday<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was to encourage consumers to shop with local businesses. When you shop locally, you help support both small business owners and your greater community as a whole. Your purchases can help create local employment opportunities, bring tax dollars to your neighborhood, and make it possible for those small businesses to give back to the community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you purchase from a small business, you help provide job opportunities. For every 10 jobs that exist at a small business, another seven are supported within the same community. Small businesses also generate two out of every three net new jobs, so shopping locally with a small business can have a big impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For every dollar spent at a local small business, roughly 67 cents stays within the community. These contributions go past tax dollars, as many small businesses support local events, sports teams, and charities. The ripple effect of shopping at small businesses goes so much farther than many people realize.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you shop small, you\u2019re helping a small business owner realize the rewards of their hard work and determination. You may be giving a parent flexibility while raising their children, or you might be supporting a lifelong passion for the business owner. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why is Small Business Saturday So Important This Year?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While shopping with local businesses is always important, it\u2019s even more critical now, as many small businesses are still struggling to recover from a challenging couple of years due to the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus pandemic quickly impacted small businesses. A report from the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/05\/state-of-small-business-report\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook &amp; Small Business Roundtable<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that within the first month of quarantine, approximately one-third of small businesses had temporarily stopped operating, and just one month later, more than half of small businesses were forced to lay off or furlough employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, with brick-and-mortar businesses ready and eager to welcome in-person shoppers once again, a strong consumer showing this holiday season could be just the thing local small businesses need to get back on track.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/about.americanexpress.com\/all-news\/news-details\/2021\/American-Express-Celebrates-the-12th-Annual-Small-Business-Saturday-Bringing-a-Digitally-Integrated-Holiday-Shopping-Experience-to-Communities-\/default.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Express Shop Small Impact survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 56% of small businesses surveyed say this year\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small Business Saturday<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is their most critical one yet.
