What about this\u00a0company was so compelling to you then?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Prashant Fuloria:<\/span>\u00a0Before I joined Fundbox, I took a few months off from work and spent time doing things that I wanted to catch up on, like\u00a0teaching, advising, and\u00a0investing.\u00a0I was looking for what to do next and in that journey, I was looking for a few things that I found at Fundbox.<\/p>\n<p>Number one, I was looking for a company that had an inspiring mission. I&#8217;ve been privileged to work at companies with strong missions:\u00a0Google&#8217;s mission was to organize the world&#8217;s information and make it universally accessible. Facebook had the mission of making the world more open and connected. In my next role, I wanted to work at a company whose mission was inspiring and big.<\/p>\n<p>One litmus test of a \u201cbig mission\u201d\u00a0is that you could work on it for a very long time, be very successful, and yet not complete the mission. The Fundbox mission of helping businesses succeed by giving them financial power\u00a0and tools that might otherwise be out of their reach passes this test and is very inspiring to me. This is especially so because all of us can relate to small businesses in some way, either as customers, as former owners, or by knowing people who&#8217;ve had both the fortune and the challenges of running a small business.<\/p>\n<p>What is also very compelling was that the mission seemed to resonate around the company. People I talked to seemed to understand the mission\u00a0and were excited by it.<\/p>\n<p>That\u00a0brings me\u00a0to the second thing, which is the people.<\/p>\n<h3>What was it about the people that stood out to you?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>PF:<\/strong> In my career, I\u2019ve learned\u00a0that you can be at a very successful company and yet be miserable on a day to day basis if you&#8217;re not working with the right people. On the other hand, you could be working at a company where you may have challenges, but every day is still fun because you know you&#8217;re going into those challenges with the right people around you.<\/p>\n<p>When I met the people at Fundbox, I found them to be incredibly smart\u00a0and talented, very passionate and energized by that mission.\u00a0Also, there were\u00a0people that I just felt would be good to partner with and that was very important for me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve grown almost four times over the last two and a half years, but I think we&#8217;ve kept that spirit in this expanded Fundbox team.<\/p>\n<p>The third compelling thing about Fundbox\u00a0for me was the execution. When I look at the company during that time, we were a little over three years old, but in three years, the company had done some amazing things. We\u00a0had a thesis and had started figuring out product market fit in their first product. We built some cool technology had a successful business with some very, very happy customers.<\/p>\n<p>Just on the basis of the customer success, the business, the product and the tech, it was clear\u00a0that this relatively small company had done a lot\u00a0over a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>Those are the three things that I saw, one the mission, two the people, three, the execution and the trajectory that said to me, there&#8217;s something special about this company.<\/p>\n<h3>In your observation, what type of person most thrives at Fundbox?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>There are some\u00a0characteristics that help people succeed and thrive at Fundbox. For one thing, people who can comprehend things quickly and can create structure out of ambiguity, and people who&#8217;ve got a lot of energy and drive all do well at Fundbox.<\/p>\n<p>Other things that come to mind are\u00a0adaptability and both the willingness\u00a0and yearning for change. As a rapidly-growing company, change is the one thing that&#8217;s constant for us.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, people for whom the mission is important or who are energized by the mission tend to do well. If you&#8217;re energized by the idea of leveling the playing field between smaller businesses and large enterprises when it comes to access to financial power, if that excites you, then Fundbox will be an exciting place to work!<\/p>\n<p>Finally, being collaborative is important. We\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0have\u00a0a \u201cstar culture.\u201d\u00a0There are certain companies where specific individuals are held up\u00a0as \u201cstars\u201d\u00a0with the explicit goal of\u00a0motivating\u00a0others\u00a0through competition or\u00a0jealousy.\u00a0Fundbox is not like that, so if you are motivated by showing how much cleverer or smarter or better you are than other people, that&#8217;s not very helpful at Fundbox.<\/p>\n<p>If,\u00a0on the other hand, you derive a lot of your energy from the success of our customers, our company and the team, then I think Fundbox is really a good place for you because it&#8217;s very collegial and highly collaborative.<\/p>\n<h3>That&#8217;s a great observation and I think that culture attracts a certain type of person, as well. What would you say about your day to day life at Fundbox? What do you spend most of your work hours doing and what are the main ways that you track your own success for yourself and for your team?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>I&#8217;m very privileged to be working with teams that are so\u00a0well-managed. The way I look at my job is to focus on whatever is needed at that moment. A\u00a0lot of my work tends to be initiative-driven. For example, if we are making changes to our recruiting process,\u00a0something that I might be deeply involved with for some period of time. Or if we are brainstorming around\u00a0a new product idea, that could be a focus of mine.<\/p>\n<p>I view my work as being very situational, based on what the company needs. The reason why I can afford that luxury is because the teams that I work with are well-managed teams that can and do run themselves, such that if, for example, I\u00a0get\u00a0run over by a truck, it\u00a0will\u00a0have virtually no impact on the day-to-day execution of those teams.<\/p>\n<h3>Except we&#8217;ll be very depressed if you were\u00a0run over by a truck!\u00a0As the head of operations, that means HR, product, engineering, data, and UX all ultimately report to you.That&#8217;s rather\u00a0different from some of the other leadership roles you&#8217;ve held, isn\u2019t it? You were head of product at Flurry, and you\u2019ve also held positions at Facebook, Yahoo and Google.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>Yes. My career is rooted in product management at companies small and large. I&#8217;ve been in companies as small as five people, startups, and at companies as large as 35,000. I have seen pretty much every scale in between.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that product management teaches you is constrained\u00a0problem solving.\u00a0The constraints can be people, resources, or time but ultimately, you&#8217;re going to solve problems in very constrained environment and that\u00a0is something that is a skill that&#8217;s carried me through my career. In some ways, my role at Fundbox is not that different from my\u00a0prior roles.<\/p>\n<h3>What did you study in school? Did you already know that developing technology products was going to be in your future?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>My undergraduate degree is in Chemical Engineering. At Stanford, I focused on Business Management from a mathematical and statistical standpoint. I have a Master&#8217;s in Statistics from Stanford, a Master&#8217;s in Business Research, and a PhD from the Business School and Operation Information and Technology with a Minor from the Engineering School.<\/p>\n<p>Did I know I\u2019d be developing tech products? Not at all.<\/p>\n<p>I graduated from IIT Delhi in my undergrad at &#8217;96 and I moved to the Bay Area to join the PhD program at Stanford. Originally, I was focused on becoming a business school faculty member. The PhD program I was part of at Stanford was and still is known for producing successful business school academics. Right till about &#8217;99, my goal was to become a business school professor.<\/p>\n<p>However, two things happened to me at that time. One was external, one was internal. This was 1999, and the Internet was booming. The bubble hadn&#8217;t burst at that time and I was thinking, wow, the world of technology is so exciting, and rather than just research it, why don&#8217;t I actually practice it?<\/p>\n<p>The second factor was, I realized that research, especially in an area like operations research or other managing practices was a lonely business. Most researchers, while they had the opportunity to teach, would basically be working by themselves or with a collaborator who was halfway across the country or world. I\u2019ve learned that I get\u00a0a lot of my energy by working with other people.<\/p>\n<p>While I loved research and I&#8217;m very glad that I did my PhD, I made the decision to finish it and then\u00a0start working at a startup. Two years later, when the bottom had fallen out of the internet business, I was asking myself:\u00a0did I just make the single biggest mistake of my life?<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, the startup ended up in a good place. I had the chance to join Google in the early days which was a very pivotal part in my career. So things have\u00a0worked out well, but certainly not without their ups and downs.<\/p>\n<h3>As a chief executive at Fundbox, you have a big impact on how our\u00a0culture develops. Can you talk a bit about how you look at that responsibility and opportunity at a rapidly-scaling company?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>Building and shaping culture is difficult. It\u2019s especially difficult to do if you&#8217;re growing very, very fast.<\/p>\n<p>While I love businesses that grow fast, I&#8217;m always a little wary if teams grow <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">too<\/span>\u00a0fast. I think that&#8217;s because bringing new people onboard, assimilating them and giving them the opportunity to understand what&#8217;s gone on before them and also what they want to change in a more thoughtful way is so\u00a0important.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy that we&#8217;ve been growing at a pace where new people have a chance to assimilate in the company. They\u00a0have a chance to experience and shape the culture as we grow. I want to consider the experience new folks get when they join, and how much of a platform they get.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve learned that it&#8217;s useful\u00a0to be as conscious or explicit about culture as possible. We spend a fair amount of time in codifying our values in what we call MOSAIC. [\u201cMOSAIC\u201d is an acronym for a set of values at Fundbox and it stands for, \u201cMission, Ownership, Speed, Achva, Innovation, and Clarity.\u201d] \u00a0I&#8217;m glad we did it not only because the values themselves are important, but the process to actually elicit those values was useful in that\u00a0it gave people the chance to reflect on\u00a0who\u00a0we\u00a0are\u00a0and who\u00a0we want to be.<\/p>\n<h3>Millennial employees\u00a0(both at Fundbox and elsewhere) have been increasingly vocal\u00a0about\u00a0how much they value inclusion and diversity. What&#8217;s your perspective on this?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PF: <\/span>There&#8217;s obviously been a lot of focus on diversity and inclusion in the recent years and that&#8217;s a very good thing. I think diversity and inclusion may go also beyond the more obvious or the visible, for example, gender or ethnic or age diversity, to things like diversities in points of view or diversities in style. For example, how do you create an environment that lets people who have different work styles flourish and contribute?<\/p>\n<p>Diversity has a lot of different dimensions to it.\u00a0Simply having people in the company that represent diversity, that&#8217;s definitely a good start, it&#8217;s necessary, but it&#8217;s not sufficient. I think the other part of it is to encourage those diverse backgrounds to manifest in discussions and decisions. For example, having people from all over the world work at a company is not that useful if that diversity of background is not somehow harnessed to make better decisions and to build a better company.<\/p>\n<p>The focus should be, how do you leverage or harness that diversity\u00a0to build a better company, a better business, and potentially a better product for your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>That\u2019s a good point, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re always trying to get better at. Thanks so much, Prashant, it\u2019s been a pleasure to hear your perspective.<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10577\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10577\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10577\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Coverflow-with-Sammy-Hagar.jpg\" alt=\"Prashant and Coverflow with Sammy Hagar\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Coverflow-with-Sammy-Hagar.jpg 960w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Coverflow-with-Sammy-Hagar-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Prashant building a different kind of culture, rocking out with his all-technologist band, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pg\/Coverflow\">Coverflow<\/a>, onstage with Sammy Hagar in 2012.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Want to work with Prashant at Fundbox?
