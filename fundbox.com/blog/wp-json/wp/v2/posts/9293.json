In contrast, men-owned businesses account for nearly 30% of the nation\u2019s revenues and about 35% of employment\u2014and these figures haven\u2019t changed much in the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">past 20 years<\/span>, SCORE notes.<\/p>\n<p>If women-owned businesses are growing in number, size and revenues and demonstrating longevity, why do they still lag behind men\u2019s businesses in terms of overall revenues and employment?<\/p>\n<p>For a long time, the conventional wisdom was that women business owners were more likely to run \u201clifestyle\u201d businesses or part-time operations\u2014for example, a stay-at-home mom with a side business to earn extra money while the kids are in school. This was thought to explain why women business owners didn\u2019t employ as many people or make as much income as men.<\/p>\n<p>However, SCORE\u2019s data shows that 62% of women business owners (compared to 69% of men) depend on their business for their primary source of income. \u201c[This] suggests that women-owned businesses are much more than casual hobbies,\u201d the report notes.<\/p>\n<p>The report doesn\u2019t offer an answer as to why women-owned businesses make up such a small percentage of revenues and employment nationwide. However, if the current trajectory continues, the number of women-owned businesses will keep on growing\u2014and eventually, the percentages of national business revenues and employment women-owned businesses are responsible for should catch up.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Do women-owned businesses face greater obstacles when seeking financing? <\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Both men and women in the survey have similar reasons for seeking financing for their businesses. The top purposes are to grow the business, to help with cash flow, and to buy new equipment.<\/p>\n<p>However, men are more likely to<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>seek financing than women. More than one-third (34%) of men have sought financing over the life of their businesses, compared to 25% of women.<\/p>\n<p>When they do receive financing, men are more likely to get it from traditional sources, such as SBA loans or equity financing from outside investors. Some 38% of men that looked for financing in the past year received SBA loans or equity financing, compared to just 31% of women.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, the women business owners in the survey are more likely to get their financing from personal connections such as borrowing money from family members or friends (25% of women vs. 20% of men). Women are also more likely to use credit card financing, although this is a popular financing source for both genders (46% of women vs. 42% of men).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9295 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/499ccb26-a082-4662-a636-4071ccab6d71_SCORE20-20Funding20source20by20gender202016.png\" alt=\"Distribution of funding sources by gender\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/499ccb26-a082-4662-a636-4071ccab6d71_SCORE20-20Funding20source20by20gender202016.png 1140w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/499ccb26-a082-4662-a636-4071ccab6d71_SCORE20-20Funding20source20by20gender202016-768x462.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source: <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/mentoring.redesign\/s3fs-public\/SCORE-Megaphone-of-Main-Street-Women%E2%80%99s-Entrepreneurship-Spring-2018.pdf\">SCORE, Megaphone of Main Street, Spring 2018<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Overall, however, the most popular source of financing for both men and women business owners is non-SBA loans. More than 50% of both men and women have obtained this type of loan.<\/p>\n<p>While bankers tend to have strict criteria for making business loans or SBA-guaranteed loans, alternative financing options are often a better bet for entrepreneurs. For example, compared to traditional loans, alternative financing sources are generally much easier to apply for and make decisions faster. They are also more likely to handle the kinds of small loans (say, $10,000 to $50,000) that banks don\u2019t want to make because they aren\u2019t profitable enough.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Want to grow your business?
