While <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demand for commercial janitorial services has spiked<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> residential cleaning services have seen <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/academy.getjobber.com\/covid-19-impact-on-home-service-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revenues fall by 35%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to the same period in 2019 and 45% since the beginning of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate a home cleaning business, it\u2019s likely you\u2019re feeling the pinch. With millions of us now working from home, concerns about infection risk have caused many Americans to suspend or cancel their cleaning services. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmmonline.com\/news\/housekeepers-still-bearing-the-brunt-of-pandemic-unemployment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the National Domestic Workers Alliance found that 72% of residential housekeepers reported they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ironically, sanitation and hygiene is more important than ever. Even leading epidemiologist, Dr. Fauci, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/how-fauci-5-other-health-specialists-deal-with-covid-19-risks-in-their-everyday-lives\/2020\/07\/02\/d4665ed6-b6fb-11ea-a510-55bf26485c93_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">admitted<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the only person who enters his house beside his wife and himself is his cleaning lady. In fact, cleaners are considered an essential service in many states and were exempt from lockdown orders. Yet as those orders have steadily lifted, residential cleaning companies still face an uphill struggle retaining existing clients and attracting new ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own a house cleaning business, now is a critical time to act. Here are some tips and strategies for growing your business during this unprecedented time (while protecting your employees and clients).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look after your employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your employees are on the frontlines of efforts to help control the pandemic, yet many <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.epi.org\/publication\/domestic-workers-chartbook-a-comprehensive-look-at-the-demographics-wages-benefits-and-poverty-rates-of-the-professionals-who-care-for-our-family-members-and-clean-our-homes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">domestic workers lack labor protections or healthcare coverage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can protect them should they get sick on the job. So, it\u2019s important that every effort should be made to protect their health \u2013 and the health of your clients.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Screen employees regularly on their recent health conditions and provide them with personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. Emphasize that PPE should be discarded after each visit and fresh ones donned before cleaning the next home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although your cleaning protocols may not change much, train your cleaning teams on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/community\/reopen-guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CDC reopening guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting homes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Position your services as \u201ccontactless\u201d<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create policies and procedures that eliminate all contact between your cleaning crews and your customers. For example, you might establish policies whereby your clients are required to vacate the home or occupy a room that isn\u2019t being cleaned while your team is on-site. If a client or their family can\u2019t leave the home, request that they also wear masks and maintain a social distance of a minimum of six feet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re quoting new business, use a video call or ask your prospects to send photos so you can provide a virtual estimate. When you schedule your visits, set defined appointment times so that your clients know when to expect you and can work around your visit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to communicate these processes to your customers. Create a video or email to share and reassure families what your company is doing to keep everyone safe. Develop an FAQ that outlines the steps and precautions you are taking and share it on your website, blog, via email, and social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjust your marketing message<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a pandemic, your client\u2019s priorities have changed and so should your messaging. Sanitation is more important than ever. To inspire customer confidence, stress the health benefits of a clean home and the measures you are taking to protect them during the cleaning process \u2013 the right disinfectants, PPE, contactless service, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the pandemic, our busy lives have made home cleaning services more of a necessity than a luxury. And now is no different. With entire families working and schooling from home, find ways to stress the emotional benefits of a clean home. Think Marie Kondo \u2013 a clean and organized home can destress and clear the mind \u2013 while keeping surfaces free from bacteria and viruses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversify your services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/report\/small-business-coronavirus-impact-poll-june#latest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than 80% of small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have pivoted from their usual service offerings. Consider your customer base and demographics and think of ways to boost your business now and for the future. Is there an opportunity to offer deep cleaning services using tools such as disinfectant foggers and ultraviolet light? Perhaps you could target clients with high-traffic homes such as vacation rentals or simply those who are hygiene conscious. Survey your existing client base to gauge interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How about partnering with a carpet or soft furnishing cleaning company and offer discounts for bundled services? Then give those clients an incentive to keep coming back with a discount off their first regular cleaning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look to your community. Are there opportunities to expand into your services into commercial cleaning (without overextending your team) such as newly opened organizations such as churches or bars, restaurants, and retail stores?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some other timely <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/coronavirus-business-pivoting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategies for pivoting your small business during coronavirus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply for a business line of credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow is a challenge for small businesses at the best of times and especially difficult in 2020.
