Here are six steps to take to prepare for your slow season:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Organize your finances<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding your business\u2019s financial situation is key to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keeping your operation alive when cash is tight<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When you have a clear picture of your cash flow, annual sales forecast, and expenses, you can create a more realistic budget and allocate your spending to the right expenditures. It\u2019s a good idea to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/find-right-accountant-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meet with your business accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to go over the following areas:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cash flow: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a cash flow forecast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to figure out how much money you have to work with during your slow season.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Expenses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a list of your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;oq=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i299.3165j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fixed expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and variable expenses to see what you need to save\u2014and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-cut-expenses\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">where you could potentially cut costs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You want to ensure you have enough cash to cover your rent, business website, debt obligations, payroll, and equipment maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sales or revenue forecast: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on your data from last year, estimate how much revenue you can generate during the slow period.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Financing: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider whether or not you need financing. You might need a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help cover ongoing operating expenses, for example, or a term loan to buy inventory in bulk before your busy season ramps up again.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Get rid of extra inventory<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inventory you carry during your business\u2019s high season can quickly become a burden come the slow season. Depending on the products or services you offer, excess inventory either means wasted revenue potential or extra storage costs\u2014and sometimes both.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offloading extra inventory gives you the chance to earn money on slow-moving stock, make the most of products with a short lifespan, and save on storage fees and future marketing expenses. Here are a few ways to get rid of inventory ahead of a slow period:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Create promotions: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling items for a discount or limited time only can help you reduce inventory fast.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Bundle products: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pair slower-moving stock with one or two customer favorites, and sell the package for a slightly higher price.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Re-market inventory:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> See if you can alter your products slightly, or market them to a different group of customers.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Return inventory to a supplier: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to your supplier to ask if they\u2019ll let you exchange or return unsold inventory.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sell inventory to another business: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the type of inventory you carry, you may be able to sell extra materials, parts, or products to another business at a discounted rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Donate your inventory: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the value of giving away your inventory versus paying to store it. You could donate products or supplies to a nonprofit organization, a local school or shelter, or a small business that needs a boost.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Brainstorm off-season revenue streams<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can find a way to keep the cash coming in when demand is lower, you might save yourself stress during the slow season. First, consider your business model, financial goals, and bandwidth. If you have the time and resources to add another revenue stream to your business, then you can start brainstorming possibilities. Here are just a few options:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Turn your service into a product: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/coronavirus-business-pivoting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting out a valuable product<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help satisfy customers and net you a bit of extra cash. If you run a business that provides ski lessons, for example, you could create and sell an online workout guide with videos and tips to keep skiers in shape during the off-season.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Experiment with a subscription model: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can bring in extra cash by giving your customers the option to sign up for a subscription. Customers could pay a monthly fee to get access to your services year-round, for example, or pay monthly in order to score discounted rates on services.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Partner with other businesses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to local businesses or complementary online companies to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/leveraging-strategic-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do cross-promotions or strategic partnerships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sublet your business space: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t need your building, storefront, or office for a few months, try subletting it out to another business.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Check in with your customers<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most effective ways to maintain your business\u2014especially before a slow period\u2014is to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-ways-enhance-customer-experience\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">focus on customer retention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After all, it\u2019s generally easier and more affordable to keep the customers you already have than it is to find new ones. Instead of letting your customers fade into the background during your slow months, find ways to stay connected. Here are some ideas:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Make a call: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you offer a seasonal service like yard maintenance or holiday light installation, reach out to your customers during the off-season to check in. You can ask if they need any help, or give them a discount code to use on their next service.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Keep customers in the loop: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your business\u2019s name top of mind by sending out regular emails with promotion opportunities, industry news, or important business announcements. If you shut down your business for a certain period of time every year, make sure your customers know when you\u2019re opening your doors again.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Create a loyalty program: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show customers you value their business by offering rewards and perks. You can offer discounts for referrals, or create a system where people get additional points with each purchase or service.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Make a marketing plan<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may not need to allocate as much money to marketing if your business has a true off-season, but it\u2019s still smart to have a game plan for the slower months. Consistent marketing is critical to drawing in new customers <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> keeping current ones engaged.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To come up with an effective plan, start by laying out your budget for marketing and advertising during peak season. From there, you can work backward and see what\u2019s realistic for the slower season. Here are just a handful of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/b2b-marketing-strategies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing strategies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you may want to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/grow-businesss-instagram\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Double-down on social media<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a way to connect with customers and promote your offerings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put out content (like email newsletters, blog posts, videos, and guides) that help generate brand awareness.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in a few low-cost, high-impact ad placements.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attend in-person events and online conferences to network and keep your business\u2019s name out there.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Invest in business improvements\u00a0<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slow periods are the perfect time to invest back into your business. Even a few simple improvements can help you increase revenue, attract more customers during the busy season, and increase operational efficiency. Before you start making changes, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/evaluating-business-goals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider your goals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the next busy season and beyond. Depending on what you want to achieve, you may decide to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Streamline administrative processes:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Assess your internal processes and systems for efficiency and ease. To fix inconveniences or problems, you may need to organize your digital files, invest in customer relationship management software, or change payroll providers.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Train your workforce: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-motivate-employees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train your employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on proper customer service and job techniques, so you can hit the ground running come busy season. You can also use this time to search for new job candidates.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Update your equipment: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule maintenance checks for big-ticket items, like point-of-sale systems, computers, machinery, and vehicles. You may want to replace old models or research new technology and equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Network: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make an effort to connect with business owners in your community and attend virtual or in-person industry conferences.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Update your website: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give your site a refresh: fix any bugs, update old content and information, and give your landing page a makeover.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a seasonal operation can be challenging, but with a little planning and preparation, you can thrive all year long.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need working capital to get through a slow period or take advantage of a busy one, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check out Fundbox\u2019s line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
