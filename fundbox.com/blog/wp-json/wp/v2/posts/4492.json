Because government buildings will be closed that day, taxes won\u2019t be due until <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Monday, April 18<\/strong><\/span>!<\/p>\n<p>Still, we all pretty much dread filing our taxes. It somehow seems like we always owe more.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the strangest tax deductions that the IRS has allowed. Who knows? Maybe your bill will be lighter this year:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Lawn care and landscaping<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Do you run your small business out of the comfort of your home? If so\u2014and your company depends on the appearance of your property\u2014you may be able to deduct lawn care and landscaping expenses from your taxes, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fox Business<\/a>. This makes sense when you start to think about it: If clients have to come to your home, they may very well be turned off by an poorly maintained\u00a0lawn.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Animal expenses\u2014yes, for tax deductions!<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You might think that there\u2019s no chance you\u2019d be able to deduct any animal-related expenses from your taxes, but you\u2019d be wrong. Believe it or not, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tools\/tax-tips\/General-Tax-Tips\/10-Strange-But-Legitimate-Federal-Tax-Deductions\/INF14190.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turbo Tax<\/a> says that business owners who use animals to protect their properties (e.g., \u201cBeware of Dog!\u201d) may be able to deduct a portion of the costs associated with caring for them from their taxes. Perhaps more sensibly, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.com\/articles\/can-your-dog-also-fetch-you-tax-deduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS<\/a> also says deductions are also awarded for organizations that raise service dogs or care for rescue animals.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u00a03.\u00a0Health-focused programs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re a smoker who\u2019s trying to quit, you\u2019ll be happy to know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-news\/ir-99-55.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the IRS allows tax deductions<\/a> for programs designed to help you kick the habit. The same does not apply, however, to non-prescription items (e.g., nicotine gums or patches). Additionally, you can deduct the expenses associated with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-news\/ir-02-40.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">weight loss programs<\/a>, so long as you\u2019re treating a specific disease.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>\u00a04.\u00a0Swimming pools<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In the early 1970s, a New York man named Herbert Cherry, who had been a longtime smoker, was diagnosed with severe emphysema. Cherry was subsequently advised by his doctor to develop an exercise regimen to improve his breathing. The doctor recommended he swim, so Cherry built a pool on his property. Ultimately, because of the doctor\u2019s order, a court ended up ruling that Cherry could deduct a large chunk of the expenses related to installing, insuring, and even heating the pool. This all according to Leagle.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. \u201cBusiness trips\u201d <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Of course you\u2019re able to deduct any expenses you incur that are related to legitimate business trips. But you may also be able to deduct expenses related to what we\u2019ll call \u201cbusiness trips\u201d\u2014if you\u2019re shrewd about it. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.efile.com\/legitimate-tax-breaks-and-unusual-extraordinary-qualified-tax-deductions-and-tax-exemptions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">efile<\/a>, a farmer went on an African safari to research wild animals. This, he argued, was critical to the success of his business. He was able to deduct the associated expenses. Similarly, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/gallery\/pf\/taxes\/2014\/03\/26\/tax-deductions\/5.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CNN<\/a>, an aspiring author was able to claim a $50,000 deduction because he wrote a book about his world travels\u2014even though said book only sold 20 copies. What kinds of \u201cbusiness trips\u201d could theoretically apply to your line of work? Answer the question, and you could be in for a nice deduction.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Tiny business gifts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/Business\/2015\/0112\/Tax-season-here.-7-changes-for-2015-and-9-of-the-weirdest-deductions\/Deduction-business-gifts-under-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Christian Science Monitor<\/em><\/a>, business owners are able to deduct business-related gifts on the basis of up to $25 per person. And if the gift you\u2019re giving costs less than $4, you can give an unlimited amount of it\u2014so long as it has your name on it (e.g., pens, pads, coffee mugs, etc.). A word to the wise: There probably aren\u2019t that many people on Earth who would turn down a $25 Amazon card.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. An iPhone<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A terrible car accident made it considerably more difficult for one woman to remember things. She successfully argued that she needed her phone\u2014which served as a personal assistant of sorts\u2014so badly that the IRS has allowed it as a tax deduction, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/gallery\/pf\/taxes\/2014\/03\/26\/tax-deductions\/10.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CNN<\/a>. If you have a hard time remembering things, there may be tools that\u2019ll help boost your memory that you can deduct as well.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s hope at least one of these deductions applies to you.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, may your tax season be as stress-free as possible!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Calculating tax deductions might not be your cup of tea, but there&#8217;s a\u00a0small shred of good news: This year, Emancipation &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":4496,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232],"yst_prominent_words":[6507,2572,6511,723,719,6510,6512,6516,4058,6515,740,6509,6513,3376,6517,6514,6508,3259,3936,4558],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"The 7 Weirdest Tax Deductions for 2015 | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"From swimming pools to an iPhone, here are the strangest tax deductions the IRS has allowed."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"The 7 Weirdest Tax Deductions for 2015 | Fundbox Blog"},{"property":"og:description","content":"From swimming pools to an iPhone, here are the strangest tax deductions the IRS has allowed."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-weirdest-tax-deductions-2015\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_188410403.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_188410403.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"665"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"From swimming pools to an iPhone, here are the strangest tax deductions the IRS has allowed."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"The 7 Weirdest Tax Deductions for 2015 | Fundbox Blog"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/shutterstock_188410403.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-weirdest-tax-deductions-2015\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4492"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4492"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4492\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":16161,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4492\/revisions\/16161"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4496"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4492"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4492"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4492"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=4492"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
