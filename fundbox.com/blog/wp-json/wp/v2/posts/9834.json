That\u2019s why we developed a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Guide to Accounting<\/span>. Over a series of posts, we highlight some of the key accounting concepts\u00a0you need to be aware of, when an accountant can help, and how to find and work with an accountant.<\/p>\n<p>In this part in the series we dive into a key question asked by many business owners: what\u2019s the best method to record income, cash or accrual accounting?<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what you need to know to make an informed decision.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Cash Accounting Method?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by defining the cash method of accounting. This is the most straightforward way to record your income and simply means that you record income as you are paid. For example, if you invoice a client on April 30th\u00a0and they paid you on May 15th, you\u2019d record the income on the latter date. Cash accounting is also known as the calendar year method.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens if you invoice in November or December, but don\u2019t receive payment until the next year? If you use the cash method, you\u2019d record that income in the new calendar year, when you get paid and report it on that year\u2019s tax return. With this method, expenses are also deducted in the tax year in which you pay them.<\/p>\n<p>One complication of the cash accounting method is that it can skew your view of your books. If November and December are your busy season, you may not see that revenue on your books until the new year. Thus, to an uninformed eye it could appear that you are showing too little profit and a negative cash flow, when in fact your business is healthy.<\/p>\n<p>The cash accounting method isn\u2019t an option for everyone. The IRS lists<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p538#en_US_201612_publink1000270649\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p538#en_US_201612_publink1000270649\">exclusions<\/a><\/span>\u00a0that include corporations (other than an S Corporation) and partnerships with a corporation as a partner with gross receipts exceeding $5 million.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Accrual Accounting Method?<\/h2>\n<p>Sold something today? If you use the accrual accounting method you can put that on the books when the sale took place, rather than waiting until you get paid (as with the cash accounting method). For example, a company provides landscaping services to a customer on May 5th\u00a0and generates an invoice that day or even the next day, with the understanding that the customer will pay within 15 days. That revenue is recorded on the date of service.<\/p>\n<p>While the accrual method provides a better snapshot of your earnings than the cash method, it could make it appear that you have more cash on hand than you do. This can be problematic if you\u2019re experiencing short-term cash flow gaps so you\u2019ll need to be diligent in maintaining and monitoring your<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast\/\">cash flow forecast<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-small-business-needs-a-cash-flow-statement\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-small-business-needs-a-cash-flow-statement\/\">cash flow statement<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for a truer picture of your cash situation.<\/p>\n<p>Who can use the accrual method? Anyone can, however, the IRS<a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p538#en_US_201612_publink1000270707\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p538#en_US_201612_publink1000270707\">mandates<\/a><\/span>\u00a0business\u2019 to adopt accrual accounting if that company has more than $10 million in annual gross receipts<\/p>\n<h2>Which is better for your business?<\/h2>\n<p>Cash accounting can seem like the sensible way to go, especially for sole proprietors and LLCs who value simplicity in their accounting. With one caveat: the cash method doesn\u2019t always fit with the complex business transactions that are common today. For example, most businesses operate on trade credit or net terms (30\/60\/90 days). The business may produce work as part of that agreement, long before it is invoiced. So, 30 days of work is done before an invoice is issued, then another 30\/60\/90 days transpires before the invoice is paid.<\/p>\n<p>If you use the cash accounting method that revenue is added to the books after 60 days from the original agreement (when payment is received). In the case of accrual accounting fans, the revenue is counted when the invoice is sent, but before cash is in hand.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, accounting software (and your accountant) can provide accrual calculations so you don\u2019t need to understand the ins and outs of what\u2019s flowing in when. And, if you\u2019re waiting on payments from clients on trade credit, consider\u00a0turning to a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox line of credit<\/a>, which can allow you to draw short-term liquid cash based on the anticipated revenue from outstanding invoices..<\/p>\n<p>When in doubt, seek the advice of an accountant, they can match you to the right accounting method based on your needs, time, and financial preferences.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Stay tuned for the next in this series where we\u2019ll discuss what an accountant can do to help your business and what they can\u2019t.
