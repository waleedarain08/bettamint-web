That\u2019s great news. Now, how should you spend that windfall to deliver maximum benefits for your business? If you need a little help deciding where the money will have the biggest impact, here are 10 ideas to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upgrade your website<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your website fast enough? The probability of users leaving a website increases by 32 percent if the site takes longer than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-to-reduce-your-websites-page-speed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 seconds to load<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Is your website easy to use on a mobile device? For several years now, the majority of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.perficient.com\/insights\/research-hub\/mobile-vs-desktop-usage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online searches<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have taken place on mobile devices, not on desktop computers. Do you want to start selling online? Your website is your storefront, so hiring a website design company or expert to update and upgrade your site is a smart move.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsource<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not ready to hire permanent, full-time employees, outsourcing can be the perfect alternative. Assess which tasks in your business could benefit from outsourcing and look for independent contractors or freelancers to tackle them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donate to charity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does your business already have a relationship with a nonprofit organization or charity? Consider sharing the wealth by making a cash donation to your cause. If you\u2019ve always wanted to get involved with a local charity, use your tax refund as the impetus to get started. (Be sure to talk to your accountant about any effects the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-a-comparison-for-businesses\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may have on tax consequences of charitable donations.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in business relationships<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is networking an important part of your sales process? Using your tax refund to pay membership dues for an industry association or networking group can reap big benefits. You could also put the money toward membership in a golf club, country club or other leisure organization where you could hobnob with prospective clients off-duty.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start (or add to) your retirement fund<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you already have a retirement fund, use your tax refund to max out your 2021 contribution. Don\u2019t have a retirement plan yet?\u00a0 Retirement plan options exist for even the smallest, one-person business. They not only help you prepare for your future, but also give you tax breaks. Learn more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/p3998.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retirement plans for small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in your mind<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world of business is changing at lightning speed, and you need new skills to keep pace. Use your tax refund to pay for courses at community colleges or online courses like those from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillshare.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skillshare<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Udemy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You can learn everything from accounting and finance to management and leadership.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in your health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are the foundation of your business, so taking care of yourself is vital \u2014 but if you\u2019re like most entrepreneurs, you don\u2019t have a lot of spare time for self-care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solve the problem by spending your refund on a personal trainer to come to your home a few days a week, a meal delivery plan, or another service that saves you time and boosts your energy levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reward yourself<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the money to take a much-needed vacation or to treat yourself to a memorable experience. (Experiences create more lasting happiness than things, studies by a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.546.6920&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cornell University professor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found.) For example, get tickets to a play, concert or sporting event you normally wouldn\u2019t splurge on.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buy or lease new Equipment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in new machinery, vehicles or other equipment your business needs can have a huge impact on your company\u2019s productivity and sales. Even something as simple as upgrading office equipment like printers and copiers can really streamline your workflow, making your employees more efficient.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hire a tax professional next year<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Was your tax refund really big? As good as it might feel to get that check, it\u2019s not such a great thing: It means you overpaid taxes during the year and let Uncle Sam use your money instead of using it yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you did your own business taxes, hold onto part of your tax refund and use it to hire a pro next year.
