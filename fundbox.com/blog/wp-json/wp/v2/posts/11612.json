But what\u2019s the best basis for doing so\u2014especially if one partner contributes more work hours, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-growth-on-budget\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invests more money into the business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or even sets up your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you need to know to plan your profit-sharing strategy in a small business partnership, plus some other steps you can take to make that partnership airtight.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Formally structure your small business<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you make any decisions about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-reasons-change-ownership-shares-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">splitting profits<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with your business partners<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a partnership contract for your small business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, talk to a lawyer about the best way to legally <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/launch-your-business\/choose-business-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">structure your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to go from a sole proprietorship model to a partnership model, here are a few business structure options for you to consider.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Two of these are general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. Let\u2019s look at both.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Partnerships:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The simplest route is to form a \u201cgeneral partnership\u201d, simply register your \u201cdoing business as (DBA)\u201d name and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/dont-mix-business-personal-finances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">open a bank account in the business\u2019 name<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This structure assumes that all profits, liability, and management duties are equally divided among the partners. If the partnership is unequal, such as a 30-70 ratio, then you\u2019d need to document the percentages assigned to each partner in the partnership agreement (more on that later).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Limited Liability Partnerships:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is a \u201climited liability partnership\u201d also known as an LLP. Professional partners, such as lawyers or accountants, are often advised to go this route since it protects the business owners from personal liability for the debts or liabilities incurred by the partnership. For example, if you run into a cash flow issue and your business fails, neither partner will be personally liable for any debts owed to creditors. Another option is a \u201climited partnership (LP)\u201d in which one partner invests in the business but doesn\u2019t manage it, leaving that task to one or more of the other partners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research these options to understand which makes more sense for you. You may want to ask your financial advisor or lawyer for advice about this, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">especially when it comes time to register your business as a chosen entity, such as an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/preparing-s-corp-deadline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s-corp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Decide how you\u2019ll split profits<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a business partnership, you can split the profits any way you want, under one condition\u2014all business partners must be in agreement about profit-sharing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can choose to split the profits equally, or each partner can receive a different base salary and then the partners will split any remaining profits. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you choose to structure your profit-sharing agreement will be up to the business partners to decide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, in an equal partnership (50-50) neither partner can make a decision without the other\u2019s approval, whereas in a 51-49 ratio, for example, one partner has final authority.

Another <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">option you have<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to pay partners only for work performed based on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predetermined<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rates for certain projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you decide, it\u2019s a good idea to create a profit-sharing agreement and make it part of your larger partnership agreement. All partners should agree and sign, to prevent problems later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Put everything in writing with a partnership agreement<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A partnership agreement is the business version of a prenuptial agreement and should be completed before you start operations and any profits are made (the division of profits is a critical part of this process). Although an agreement is not legally required, it can protect your interests as one half of the partnership for the duration of your partnership and through its dissolution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things to include in the agreement include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Division of profits<\/strong>. This includes both the division of profits and losses and how and when each partner will get paid.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Contributions to the partnership<\/strong>. If either partner contributes any assets to the business, whether it\u2019s cash, property, or equipment, you\u2019ll need to ensure these are documented.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Business decision-making<\/strong>. What authority does each partner have to make business decisions? How will you handle disputes?

Divide up your management duties and document them in the agreement.

If your partnership has evolved over the past year or is likely to change in the coming year, it\u2019s important that you revisit your partnership or profit-sharing agreement to reflect these subtleties. If you need to change your agreement drastically, consider bringing in the services of your lawyer or accountant to make sure everything is correctly documented.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Understand how business partnerships are taxed<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you structure your profit-sharing agreement, you\u2019ll also need to be aware of how the IRS taxes partnerships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a partnership, the business \u201cpasses through\u201d any profits or losses to its partners. Partners include their respective share of the partnership\u2019s income or loss on their personal tax returns. Partnerships do, however, need to file an annual <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-1065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">information return<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Form 1065), also known as a \u201cPartnership Tax Return\u201d to report income, deductions, gains, losses, and more with the IRS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partners are not employees and should not be issued a Form W-2. The partnership must provide copies of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to each partner showing their respective share of profits for the year by the date Form 1065 is required to be filed, including extensions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read more about <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/partnerships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partnerships tax obligations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on IRS.gov.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Plan for a happy and profitable partnership<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protecting yourself before you start a business partnership is your best strategy for ensuring the union is a happy one. To make sure you\u2019re both getting the most out of this partnership, you\u2019ll want to come to terms on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">profit-sharing. Let\u2019s look at a few common profit-sharing questions for more insight into this important aspect of a partnership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is profit-sharing in a business?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you decide to split your profits depends on your small business partnership agreement. When creating your partnership agreement, all the partners in the business need to agree on how to share profits. You may choose to share the profits equally or you may decide to pay each partner a set salary and then divvy up any remaining profits in a certain type of way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you form an equal partnership (50-50) between two people, you will both need to make decisions regarding profit-sharing together and will need each partner\u2019s approval to make these decisions. However, if you have an uneven partnership ratio, the partner with the majority share in the business will get to make the final decision regarding profit-sharing and salaries.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how you choose to divide up your profits, you\u2019ll need to create a profit-sharing agreement that is a part of your overall partnership agreement and all partners need to approve of and sign the profit-sharing agreement in order to make sure everyone is on the same page. In this partnership, you\u2019ll also want to put into writing how you will divide any losses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is a good profit-sharing percentage?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no one clear answer for what a good profit-sharing percentage is for all businesses. How many partners you have, how much work each partner does, the experience they bring to the table, and how much money each partner has invested in the business will likely play a factor in how you split up profits. While an equal 50-50 partnership may work for a business with two partners who are equally involved, other partnerships may not be built on such equal footing and may require that one partner receives more profits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who is eligible for profit-sharing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who is eligible for profit-sharing will depend on your profit-sharing and partnership agreements. Working with a lawyer and accountant to develop a profit-sharing agreement will help ensure that everyone knows exactly what their role in the business is and how that relates to their profits. You want to have a legal agreement in place to help avoid any confusion and disagreements from popping up in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What are the disadvantages of profit-sharing?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most obvious disadvantage of profit-sharing is that you have to share your profits. While sharing your profits with business partners may work well for a while, the profit-sharing agreement business partners originally put in place may not feel appropriate over time as the business evolves and changes. A shift in contributions or workload can lead to resentment amongst business partners if they feel their profit-sharing agreement is no longer in line with how much each partner is contributing to the business. In many cases, a profit-sharing agreement can work well and never need to be changed, but it is also a possibility that changes may need to occur over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to reevaluate your profit-sharing agreement from time to time. You may want to agree upfront to reevaluate your profit-sharing agreement annually in order to reflect on changes that occurred throughout the year. Working with your lawyer or accountant can be helpful if you need to change your agreement substantially, as they can make sure these important changes are documented properly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have any doubts about whether a partnership is right for you, read these <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8 Questions to Ask Before Entering into a Business Partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
