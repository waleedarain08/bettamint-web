Beckford, who was unsatisfied with her current job as a university fundraiser, saw an opportunity to take a chance. Beckford and her father won the contract and co-founded commercial cleaning company <a href=\"http:\/\/ozglo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OZGLO<\/a> in the winter of 2002 with funds from her father\u2019s retirement. Based in Connecticut, OZGLO currently maintains cleaning service contracts with several local schools.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had to be fully operational in weeks, and neither one of us knew anything about running our own cleaning business,\u201d Beckford says. \u201cWe had to stumble a lot\u2014pull together friends for staff and go through the yellow pages and try to figure stuff out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Startup costs were a challenge. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Beckford recalls. \u201cBut we knew if we had a little bit of seed money, that would carry us and help us get a few pieces of equipment\u2014vacuums, cleaning carts and t-shirts.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5703\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5703\" style=\"width: 498px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5703 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Kim_OZGLO1_2016.png\" alt=\"OZGLO cash flow\" width=\"498\" height=\"640\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kimberly Beckford, Owner of OZGLO Cleaning Company<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Beckford quickly discovered that her biggest problem was meeting payroll. The demand for her company\u2019s services rose and fell because of seasonality while the cost of materials steadily increased. Her cash flow was constantly in flux.<\/p>\n<p>She ran into serious issues in 2009 when the economy collapsed and she lost smaller clients who wanted to take cleaning services in-house.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith our largest client, we had a 30 percent cut to our account, which left us short $5,000 every month,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had to figure out how I was going to make up $5,000 a month.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The recession demonstrated to Beckford that her clients wouldn\u2019t always appreciate the cost of cleaning services, which meant she always needed to be prepared with backup funds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to battle that before, and it&#8217;s still a challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to pitch business services to a person or company that doesn\u2019t place the same value on what you do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even after the recession, Beckford\u2019s company frequently came up short on cash. Too often, she had to ask immediate family for loans or turn to cash advances.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI can remember a cycle where our reserves had been tapped so badly that we had twice as much money in arrears as we normally had,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5704 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/new-logo-design-FINAL1-300x145.png\" alt=\"OZGLO cash flow\" width=\"300\" height=\"145\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It got to a point where timing invoices to meet payroll was so difficult that Beckford desperately needed a new solution. That\u2019s when she discovered <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=how-ozglo-uses-fundbox-to-manage-cash-flow-crunches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> through an ad on Facebook. Fundbox advances the full value of your invoice, and funds are available in your bank account the next day. These advances help business owners cover obligations like payroll and rent while they wait on payments to roll in. The unlocked cash flow can also help more enterprising entrepreneurs take on new projects and growth opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy immediate thought was who in the world was going to take a chance on a business that\u2019s so financially fragile?\u201d Beckford remembers.<\/p>\n<p>Even though she was skeptical, she figured she\u2019d give it a shot. She was amazed when she was granted Fundbox Credit and used it right away to clear payroll.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s real money in the account, and I can pay people while I wait for checks to come in,\u201d Beckford says. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing lifesaver.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Now Beckford uses Fundbox in conjunction with Freshbooks to manage her cash flow. She covers her payroll and other expenses and no longer has to ask friends and family for help and extra funds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to know I have a viable financial resource that I\u2019m very comfortable with,\u201d says Beckford. \u201cIt gives me a sense of hope and encouragement to watch our credit grow with Fundbox.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beckford\u2019s larger goal is to stabilize her business and to make some major equipment purchases and upgrades.
