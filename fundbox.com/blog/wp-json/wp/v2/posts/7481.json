While there were fewer than 50 million elderly Americans in 2015, it\u2019s expected there will be 70 million of them by 2030, according to census data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That growth, coupled with the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act and the public\u2019s need for medical care, has created many opportunities for entrepreneurs to make some serious cash by building businesses that provide needed healthcare services. This is why more and more entrepreneurs are starting medical transportation companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In large part, these non-emergency transportation companies take elderly and disabled patients from their homes to routine appointments and checkups, then back again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patients who use non-emergency medical transportation companies are usually on stretchers, wheelchair-bound, or rely on walkers or canes to move from place to place. In almost all instances, these folks are simply unable to use traditional transportation services\u2014like taxi cabs or buses\u2014to get from Point A to Point B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since they require some sort of assistance, they have two options when it comes to getting to their appointments: call an ambulance and spend a lot of money or use a non-emergency medical transportation company that\u2019s much more affordable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many patients\u2014or at least those in charge of managing their finances\u2014choose the latter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about starting a medical transportation company, that\u2019s great news. You\u2019ve figured out that there\u2019s an increasing need for this kind of service which appears likely to continue growing, with no signs of slowing down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it stands now, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/north-american-healthcare-mobility-markets-report-2020-bourgeoning-nemt-market-is-expected-to-cross-15-billion-by-2027-due-to-tnc-entry-301218021.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-emergency medical transportation sector<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is expected to generate $15 billion annually by 2027. How do you get the biggest slice of that pie?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I start a profitable senior transportation business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Make sure you have enough money<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, you might be asking yourself this question: How much does it cost to start a medical transportation company?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all of the associated <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dhcs.ca.gov\/provgovpart\/Pages\/MedicalTransportationProviderApplicationInformation.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regulatory start-up costs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it can take hundreds of thousands of dollars to start your own non-emergency medical transportation company. You need to register your business; cover legal, insurance, permit, and licensing fees; acquire a facility; purchase vehicles; pay utility bills and wage expenses; launch a website; and cover other costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you move forward any further, make sure you have enough money to launch the business. If not, you may have to sell some equity in your business to an investor, apply for a small business loan, or obtain a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Pick the right location<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because everyone needs healthcare services, you can also open a profitable business in practically any part of the country. That said, you still want to do your due diligence ahead of time to figure out whether it makes sense to open in specific markets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if there are a lot of non-emergency medical transportation companies in a small city, you may want to open up shop somewhere that doesn\u2019t have as much competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for locations that have dialysis centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other senior assisted-living facilities nearby. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll get most of your revenue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget that some students need non-emergency medical transportation, too. You may also be able to secure contracts through local school districts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Take care of legal and insurance aspects<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019d be surprised at how many people forget to tackle the fine print when they\u2019re launching a business. First things first: you may want to incorporate your medical transport company to start things off. Incorporating can ensure you won\u2019t lose your personal assets in the event you get sued, and should be something you consider.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also need to figure out which kind of driver\u2019s license you need to take people from one location to another, which varies on a state-by-state basis. Additionally, you\u2019ll need general liability insurance, car insurance, and worker\u2019s compensation insurance in the event one of your employees is injured on the job.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Figure out how to market your business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019re all set up, it\u2019s time to go out and land your first clients and start <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/the-5-step-blueprint-to-growing-your-small-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growing your small business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do some research to find out how much your competitors charge their customers and price your services with that in mind. Next, you\u2019ll want to send out some marketing information to prospective customers to let them know that you\u2019re open for business. Offering\u00a0 discounts is a great way to encourage people to give you a shot.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will also want to maintain an SEO-friendly blog that covers relevant industry trends and helpful tips your customers will appreciate. Use social media to promote those posts. That way, when people are looking for a company that offers your services, they\u2019ll find you. You may also want to see if you can form partnerships with hospitals, nursing homes, and other similar facilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Make sure you can collect payments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business needs the ability to collect payments. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the non-emergency medical transportation industry, you will generally deal with two types of payments: those that come from the patients (or the people who manage their finances) and those that come from the government. In some instances, it may make sense for you to install a device that enables you to collect credit card payments in your vehicle, similar to what many taxis have. In other instances, it might not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medicaid payments will most likely be a major portion of your total receipts. The laws vary from county to county, so make sure you\u2019re familiar with the ones that affect your business before launching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from the Medicaid patients, some clients will be able to pay bills by themselves either by writing checks or paying with cash on the spot. In other instances, you\u2019ll have to bill their guardians, who are responsible for managing their finances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that you may have to wait a while before collecting the second type of payments. If you run into cash flow problems while waiting for checks to come in, you can use an invoice financing service like Fundbox to advance payments on outstanding invoices.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Hire employees as your business grows<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you get more patients and land bigger contracts, you\u2019ll need to hire enough drivers, coordinators, and support staff to handle the higher volume.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure your patients get the quality of service they\u2019re looking for, do your best to hire the best and brightest experienced workers you can find. Assuming you\u2019re the CEO, you\u2019ll need to hire drivers and an office manager.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on how big your company gets, you may also need to hire a dedicated marketing team, a finance department, and a human resources manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Stay on top of changing laws<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of this writing, the ACA is the law of the land. To ensure your company never runs afoul of the law, it is imperative that you stay informed about any new regulations coming down the pike that may affect your business. You will also want to stay abreast of potential changes to tax laws that impact your company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to start your medical transportation company?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any other business, starting a medical transportation company is hard work. As long as you know that from the outset and are willing to put in the time and energy necessary to succeed, your business is off to a great start.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only can starting a medical transportation company generate a lot of revenue and create a lot of jobs, you\u2019ll also be providing a critical service to a number of elderly and disabled patients\u2014helping them and their loved ones enjoy a better quality of life. In many ways, it\u2019s the best of both worlds.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thanks to advances in medicine and technology, the population of elderly people in the United States continues to increase.
