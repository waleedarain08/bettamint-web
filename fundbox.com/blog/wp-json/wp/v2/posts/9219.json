Lightwave is a family-operated business, specializing in power and industrial work. Fundbox customer Luis has pursued the electrical trade for decades, and brings his many years of experience along with his commitment to integrity and quality, to every job.

Specifically, we bring in power into the buildings and specializing industrial work around Dade and Broward County.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: Why do you do what you do?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve been an electrician since I was 18. I like working with my hands. So, 5 years ago I decided to create my business to give the best service to the good people of Dade and Broward county. There are always delays in construction so we believe in giving our customers the best value through quality service.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: What is your guiding philosophy behind your business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Here at Lightwave, we were trained by the union and believe in an old school way of doing business. We really adhere to the Golden Rule, \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d I don\u2019t look at my customers as dollar signs. The customer is not our enemy. We do business in an honest and authentic way.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don\u2019t look at my customers as dollar signs. We do business in an honest and authentic way.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: What makes your business unique?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned before, we do business in an honest, authentic way to deliver the best service to our customers. We listen to the customers needs and we know that they don\u2019t want to be scammed. Nobody likes going to the mechanic to fix one little thing for $50 and come back and suddenly the bill is $500 because they found something that wasn\u2019t on \u00a0your radar.<\/p>\n<p>We listen to our customers, understand their needs and based off of that we try to see how to solve the problem in a realistic way. There is always delays in construction so we try to give a realistic time frame for our customers. In a way, we treat them like they were our own relatives. I wouldn\u2019t want to hurt my own grandparents, parents or siblings when I\u2019d be doing business with them, so why do that to our customers? It\u2019s not fair for them and it would just be bad business for us.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9220\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9220\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-9220\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/998d217d-756e-44d9-80c1-c97872567828_254c6cedef7e05afb395c084ec02c203.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the Lightwave Electrical Contractors team.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/998d217d-756e-44d9-80c1-c97872567828_254c6cedef7e05afb395c084ec02c203.jpg 1440w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/998d217d-756e-44d9-80c1-c97872567828_254c6cedef7e05afb395c084ec02c203-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Part of the Lightwave Electrical Contractors team.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: Do you believe that\u2019s why your business has been so successful?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I do. We don\u2019t tend to advertise. Yes, we have a website that we need to do some update from time to time, and a few social media pages, but no big advertising campaigns. So our customers are our best advocates for the way we do business. If you\u2019re honest with them and do right by them, people become the best advertisers. Thanks to them, we were selected the 2017 Klein Tools Electrician of the Year in the Southeast.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our customers are our best advocates&#8230; If you\u2019re honest with them and do right by them, people become the best advertisers.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: What do you wish you knew when you first started your business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I wish I knew more about payroll taxes, workman\u2019s compensation, dealing with contracts, making sure everything is written down and clear.<\/p>\n<p>When we started five years ago, we didn\u2019t know the costs of doing business. For example, we used to buy a ceiling fan for our customer for $50 and install it for $75, which wasn\u2019t sustainable for our business.\u00a0We have four employees, including my wife and I, and payroll costs thousands of dollars a quarter.\u00a0So, me and my wife decided that we were going to do things right from the get-go. Thanks to Fundbox, we have had success in continuing our operations!<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Q: How has Fundbox helped your business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>I feel comfortable using Fundbox. You guys have the same philosophy we have towards our customers. There are no surprises and no hidden costs. If it says that I\u2019m going to pay X amount in 24 weeks with this X amount of interest, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to pay without any surprises. I don\u2019t even think twice before clicking the button [on the site]. They\u2019re gonna do what they say they\u2019re gonna do and that helps my business have more strength to continue.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9229\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/LuisGonzalez-I-wish-I-knew.png\" alt=\"Luis Gonzalez I wish I knew\" width=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/LuisGonzalez-I-wish-I-knew.png 800w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/LuisGonzalez-I-wish-I-knew-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In I WISH I KNEW, we talk to business owners about their career paths, their business growth, and the lessons they\u2019ve learned along the way.
