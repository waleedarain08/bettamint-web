In Shannon Ross\u2019s experience, being an entrepreneur has empowered him to advocate for the marginalized community he belongs to: the population of previously incarcerated people, also known as system-impacted individuals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon is the co-founder of D\u2019s Trucks, a trucking business he started with a childhood friend in the spring of 2021. However, the company is just one facet of Shannon\u2019s overarching mission to support his fellow system-impacted individuals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He is also the executive director of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thecommunitynow.us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Community<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an organization he started while still incarcerated. The Community is dedicated to helping system-impacted individuals fulfill their potential and decreasing the stigma associated with having a criminal record. In addition, Shannon is a consultant with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/paradigmshyft.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paradigm Shyft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a firm that provides education about equity and inclusion practices for hiring, teaching, and working with system-impacted people.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon believes that when employers embrace the humanity of people with criminal records, they can change lives and shape their communities for the better. Here, Shannon shares his experiences re-entering the workforce after being incarcerated, how he helps others do the same, and what small business owners can do to make a difference in their own communities by investing in system-impacted individuals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Re-entering the workforce with a criminal record<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During his 17 years in the Wisconsin prison system, Shannon was committed to working and furthering his education despite incarceration. Throughout his sentence, Shannon spent time <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shannon-ross-b0378717a\/details\/publications\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing about his experiences<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and building a Buddhist meditation practice which led to the opportunity to design and run a coping skills program at the Stanley Correctional Institution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the major challenges Shannon faced as an inmate was completing his university education, which he had begun before his arrest. He faced many systemic obstacles in his pursuit of a Bachelor of Arts in business administration, which he detailed in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bostonreview.net\/articles\/shannon-ross-college-behind-bars\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an article for the Boston Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In light of these challenges, Shannon\u2019s family stepped in to help him search for funding and courses that he could take while in prison. This ongoing support and his commitment to his studies enabled him to graduate in 2017. Toward the end of his sentence, he won a fellowship to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uwm.edu\/nursing\/academics\/msp\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Master\u2019s program in sustainable peacebuilding<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the School of Nursing at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He began his first semester a week before he was released.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon\u2019s graduate program fellowship supported his transition back into the workforce and enabled him to earn an income for going to school. During the transition, he also continued to expand his work through The Community. Shannon\u2019s experience with overcoming adversity as he prepared for re-entry into the workforce has made him particularly passionate about ensuring that people who are still incarcerated get the support they need through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thecommunitynow.us\/pre-entry\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Community\u2019s pre-entry resources.\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few months after being released, Shannon connected with his childhood friend, Brian Adams, who had recently left his job and was looking to start his own business. In March 2021, the two began operating D\u2019s Trucks with Brian behind the wheel and Shannon overseeing business development.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Transforming community through business<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move past stereotypes and get curious about how the business can make a positive impact on an individual\u2019s life.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tap into a wider talent pool by providing opportunities for upskilling and apprenticeship to system-impacted individuals.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultivate an empathetic workplace with a culture of connection and understanding that encourages employee loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uplifting system-impacted individuals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the imperatives of D\u2019s Trucks is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dstrucksllc.com\/about-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">providing employment opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for other system-impacted individuals. This includes prioritizing hiring previously incarcerated people as well as providing business development support for those with criminal records who are interested in starting their own trucking companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This work goes hand-in-hand with Shannon\u2019s advocacy work through The Community\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correcting the Narrative Campaign<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and extends to his consulting practice at Paradigm Shyft. Through Paradigm Shyft, Shannon helps educate businesses on what previously incarcerated people need from their employers to attract, retain, and thoughtfully manage workers who are system impacted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon believes that there is a wealth of untapped talent among those who have a criminal record. Based on his extensive experience as a community leader who deals with many people with criminal records, Shannon has seen firsthand the character development that individuals experience while in the prison system. \u201cThere&#8217;s a significant level of potential, a great level of humility, and oftentimes, a high level of willingness to be on a team and move forward in life,\u201d he says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon knows that when employers see system-impacted individuals as people with unique skill sets and valuable perspectives to bring to the table, they <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-ways-attract-recruit-new-employees-great-resignation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stand to gain loyal, driven employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe general bias toward [the label of ex-convict] overlooks the fact that people who are incarcerated are usually very hungry to come out and get their life going,\u201d says Shannon. \u201cIn this group, in particular, they&#8217;re very open to being given that chance and recognize that this is something they should hold on to. They respect the opportunities they\u2019re given; they&#8217;re not entitled all the time. They&#8217;re willing to communicate and deal with [challenging] situations that other people may not be willing to tolerate.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other small businesses can have a significant effect on their communities when they choose to hire system-impacted individuals. Shannon emphasizes that \u201cwhen you have people who are getting a good wage and have autonomy in their job and have a sense of self-respect, they&#8217;re going to be better in their neighborhoods and with their families, which is what we all want.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses looking to support workers in the system-impacted community can start by providing training programs or apprenticeship opportunities that allow those whose job-related skill building has been interrupted by their time in prison. From a human resources standpoint, another key area to focus on is engaging in company-wide communication about destigmatizing employees with criminal records and ensuring that these team members feel welcomed, understood, and respected.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultivating empathy in the workplace<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon\u2019s experiences in prison made him a humble leader with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-motivate-employees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deep empathy for employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an attitude he hopes to instill in other small business leaders in his community. Shannon\u2019s frustrations about being an employee at the mercy of the emotions of his managers were mirrored by interactions he often had with security staff while in prison.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBeing incarcerated and dealing with security staff every day who have so many traumas and difficulties \u2014 they\u2019d take it out on us,\u201d Shannon recalls, \u201cAnd so, I love being in a position where I can say, \u2018Hey, I do have [things] going on in my life, but I&#8217;m never going to bring that to you. And I&#8217;m going to listen and I&#8217;m going to be open.\u2019\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of his experiences, Shannon is committed to showing up for his community, employees, and consulting clients with a willingness to treat people with exceptional respect. \u201cEvery single person you deal with every day is going through something. We should just try to deal with each other as individuals in the moment.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This approach underpins Shannon\u2019s foundational desire to help people improve and heal, regardless of their background. In his own life, he\u2019s seen how transformative having compassionate support from family and community can be for making lasting change for the better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI call myself an inevitability,\u201d Shannon says. \u201cI was given things that made it very, very unlikely for me to not succeed. When you offer that support to an individual, you&#8217;re giving them the nourishment to grow into their potential, and they&#8217;re not likely to fail.\u201d His mission is to give people the care they deserve to reach their full potential and the resources they need to make their success a certainty, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Small businesses have the opportunity to push systemic change forward with simple steps that make it possible for individuals from marginalized communities to thrive. Focusing on finding talent that can bring innovative ideas, team spirit, and a new approach to the business \u2014 rather than giving into stereotypes \u2014 enables small businesses to differentiate themselves and get ahead. Above all, cultivating an empathetic, inclusive workplace improves the communities your business serves, contributing to a better world for all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re curious about how your business can support system-impacted individuals, learn more through The Community\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thecommunitynow.us\/ways-to-get-involved\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resources page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
