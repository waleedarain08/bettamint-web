One way to make your business more successful is to start paying close attention to your business&#8217;s cash flow statement.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is the Cash Flow Statement?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Your business&#8217;s income statement shows your net income while the balance sheet shows how much cash you have on hand. The cash flow statement provides a detailed map of where the business&#8217;s income comes from and where it goes, making it very useful for day-to-day operations.<\/p>\n<p>The cash flow statement has three sections:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Operating Activities (money earned from\/spent on operations)<\/li>\n<li>Investing Activities (money spent on assets\/equipment or earned from investments)<\/li>\n<li>Financing Activities (money distributed to owners\/stockholders and funds received from\/repaid to financing sources).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>What Can You Learn from Your Cash Flow Statement?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you rarely look at your cash flow statement, you&#8217;re missing key information that can help you run your business more effectively. Reviewing your cash flow statement can give you many insights into the health of your business. Here are seven things your cash flow statement may reveal.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Is your business attractive to lenders or investors?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many investors prefer businesses that consistently generate a lot of cash; it ensures they will get their dividends. Banks look closely at the financing section of your cash flow statement to see how you have handled loan repayments in the past.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Do you have excess cash available that could be better used?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, a business has excess cash on hand that could be used more profitably by purchasing equipment or other assets, or just by moving it into an interest-bearing account.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Are you carrying too much inventory?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Excess inventory costs money to store. Improve your cash flow by using just-in-time methods to maintain appropriate inventory levels.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Are your customers taking too long to pay?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can shorten the payment cycle by following up on overdue payments immediately, offering discounts for early payment, and invoicing right after a job is finished. In some industries, however, lengthy payment cycles are a fact of life. In this case, a quick and easy invoice financing solution from <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> can help.

Negotiate with suppliers for more favorable payment terms.

Your business may appear to have a healthy net income based on the income statement, but the cash flow statement reveals whether most of the income is from loans or putting personal money into the business. If your core business operations aren&#8217;t generating the majority of your cash, your business isn&#8217;t sustainable as is.

For example, what if you need to buy lots of inventory for your busy season but won&#8217;t recoup that outlay until the products sell? A financing solution like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> can help, and you can choose between 12 or 24-week repayment terms.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your cash flow statement is a window into the health of your business.
