Invoice Financing Can Help Your Cash Flow"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>You&#8217;ve finally decided that now is the time to start your small business. Although you know you&#8217;ll have many challenges ahead\u2014especially during your first year\u2014perhaps your biggest concern is this: How am I going to pay for all the initial startup costs?\u00a0For many small business owners, this includes advertising, purchasing office equipment, hiring employees, buying inventory, and the list goes on. Perhaps you&#8217;ve considered your financial options, such as loans or invoice financing.<\/p>\n<p>While there are a multitude of different types of loans available for small businesses, you&#8217;ve probably already decided you don&#8217;t want to incur major debt right out of the gate. You also don&#8217;t want to find yourself unable to pay your bills when you&#8217;re just starting to generate income. On the flipside, you want to do your best to ensure that your cash flow remains steady\u2014not an easy feat for new businesses without a clientele, steady customer base, or loyal following. For these reasons, <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=new-business-invoice-financing-help-cash-flow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invoice financing<\/a> may be the best way to ensure that you can meet your financial obligations so you can focus on ramping up your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What is invoice financing and how does it work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Invoice financing is a type of financing that pays your unpaid invoices by advancingg the cash value of those invoices and depositing them into your business&#8217;s bank account right away. You&#8217;ll then repay the advances over a set time period, but you can start using the money for your business needs immediately. This is often the most affordable financing option for a small business as you won&#8217;t have to pay the high interest rates often associated with a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-guide-to-business-financing-options?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=new-business-invoice-financing-help-cash-flow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business loan or credit advance<\/a>. Many also confuse invoice financing with invoice factoring<u>, <\/u>but the two forms of financing are not the same. Here are two key differences:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Invoice factoring companies advance only a percentage of your invoice value. Invoice financing companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/pricing\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=new-business-invoice-financing-help-cash-flow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> advance 100% of the value of your invoice.<\/li>\n<li>Invoice factoring companies collect on your behalf from your customers. When you work with an invoice financing company, it&#8217;s up to you to make sure you get paid from your clients or customers. Your customers then never need to know that you&#8217;ve made alternative arrangements to receive payment faster.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>In more detail, here&#8217;s how invoice financing works through Fundbox. You set up a Fundbox account and\u00a0select your bookkeeping app, then choose the invoice you&#8217;d like to clear. Next, Fundbox transfers the full amount to your designated bank account. You will then make weekly payments to Fundbox, including a small fee, to pay back these advances. Your weekly payments are calculated by adding 1\/12 of the invoice value plus a fee.<\/p>\n<p>For a $1,000 invoice, your weekly payment would be about $89 for 12-week repayment. This includes $83 for invoice value, and roughly $6 in fees. You also have the option to choose 24-week repayment at about $48\/week ($42 of invoice value + $6 in fees). Fees may vary, but you&#8217;ll always see your fee and weekly payment in the Fundbox dashboard before you confirm the invoice to clear.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The benefits for your new business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>With invoice financing, you won&#8217;t have to deal with major cash flow gaps, especially when you may be spending an excess amount of money just to get your business up and running. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence about invoice financing, here are some of the top reasons why this might be the best solution for your new business:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Fast cash<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You will have money in the bank almost immediately with no need to wait weeks and sometimes months to get paid.
