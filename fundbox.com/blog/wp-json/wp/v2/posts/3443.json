But how do you incorporate the holiday season into your email marketing without coming across as cheesy? And, more importantly, how to you make sure your emails stand out from the crowd? Here are seven things you can do to make sure your holiday emails work.[Tweet &#8220;Email marketing still delivers the greatest return of any marketing tactic.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set a Goal<\/strong><br \/>\nDon\u2019t feel you have to blast a holiday-themed email out just because it\u2019s the season, and everyone\u2019s doing it. Think about your goals. What do you want the reader to do? Print a coupon, download something, view a video link? Each email you send should have a clear goal, messaging and call-to-action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stand Out<\/strong><br \/>\nInboxes are crowded places at this time of year, so think of ways to make your email stand out. Use fun, abbreviated subject line (something that teases and draws the reader to open the email). Use offers creatively. Make them time bound or customize them for certain customer segments \u2013 such as 15% off for loyal or active customers, 10% for prospects, that kind of thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t Neglect Your Subject Line<\/strong><br \/>\nSpeaking of subject lines, now more than ever is the time to get them right. That small window of text is your only opportunity to get the attention of your audience. Check out these tips for improving your email open rates by <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/9-things-you-can-do-to-improve-your-email-open-rates\/#.VgQ9lPlVhBc\">mastering your subject line<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use Pre-Designed Templates<\/strong><br \/>\nEmail software providers like Constant Contact and MailChimp offer a variety of pre-designed templates that you can use. Many are flexible in their design and can be customized using your logo. Just add your holiday message and you\u2019re off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Test Your Emails<\/strong><br \/>\nAnother way to ensure your email stands out is to test it. Simply test two or three versions of your email to a very small subset of your email list. Then monitor the results to see which offer, subject line or time of day works best. Email software can help with this process of A\/B testing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Carry Your Message Across Other Channels<\/strong><br \/>\nThere\u2019s a good chance that most of your email subscribers follow you on social media too. Make sure to post the same offer, message and holiday-themed imagery across these sites, giving you more opportunities to get their attention.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a bricks and mortar business, print flyers or posters that showcase your holiday marketing offers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keep Holiday Customers Engaged with a Nurture Email Program<\/strong><br \/>\nUse your email software and CRM to track who took actions based on your holiday email, and then plan a nurture campaign to keep them engaged. These emails are distinct from your regular email marketing efforts and are triggered automatically by an action. Nurture emails are a great way to cross-sell, up-sell and keep customers interested in your business.<\/p>\n<p>Happy holidays!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pumpkins, turkeys, Black Friday sales, and even holiday music!
