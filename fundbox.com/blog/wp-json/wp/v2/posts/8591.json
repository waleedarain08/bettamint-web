With limited reserves on hand, many small businesses can\u2019t invest in growing their business, even when exciting new opportunities arise. Fuse allows Fundbox partners to help their customers gain access to capital inside the partner\u2019s workflow\u2014in places where the customer is most open to thinking about funding for their business.<\/p>\n<p>Fuse allows Fundbox partners to solve the number one need for small businesses: cash flow. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/medialibrary\/media\/smallbusiness\/2016\/SBCS-Report-EmployerFirms-2016.pdf\">84%<\/a> of small businesses report that they can\u2019t get as much funding as they seek, and <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2017\/11\/2018-small-business-trends.html\">23%<\/a> say that budget constraints were their top concern going into 2018. But small businesses don\u2019t always know where to go in search of capital for their business. With Fuse, partners can place a button anywhere inside their product\u2019s workflows\u2014including places where the customer is most receptive to getting funding for their business.<\/p>\n<p>Fuse is a grey labeled, light integration that allows partners to meet the capital needs of their clients from within their workflow. Fuse appears as a button. When the business owner clicks on the \u201cGet Business Credit\u201d button, a panel opens from the right side of their screen. They can learn about Fundbox and apply for funding inside this panel without leaving their workflow. When they\u2019re done, the panel closes and they go right back to working inside the partner\u2019s solution again. If approved, the customer can draw funds by clicking on the same button they used to apply, so they\u2019ll always know where to go for credit. They\u2019ll also have another great reason to return to the partner\u2019s solution.<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/837d2190-51ca-497c-8d90-5333ce7ed7a3.png\" alt=\"Demo: Screenshot of Fundbox Fuse in action.\" width=\"400\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Demo: Screenshot of Fundbox Fuse in action.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fuse offers the intuitive, simple experience that has become Fundbox\u2019s hallmark. Small business customers apply by connecting either their business bank account or their accounting software. In as little as a few hours, they can receive a credit decision.
