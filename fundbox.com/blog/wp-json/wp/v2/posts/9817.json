Built a Business to Weather Any Storm<\/h2>\n<p>Being an electrician is part of Nick Herron\u2019s DNA: Nick is a fourth-generation electrician from New York state. Given his lineage, it was no surprise to his friends and family when he became the youngest master electrician in New York state history, founding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hitchcockandcompany.com\/\">Hitchcock &amp; Company &#8211; Licensed Master Electrician<\/a> when he was only 23 years old.<\/p>\n<p>Hitchcock &amp; Company serves commercial and residential clients in the Hudson River Valley area of New York. The company has carved out a niche as one of the only vertically-integrated electricians in the area. They handle a wide variety of projects end-to-end, from scoping and planning, applying for permits, installing new generators, wiring, or lighting, to servicing the installations.<\/p>\n<p>Nick built the business as a one-stop-shop on purpose, to address a real need he noticed in the market. He saw the challenges his customers faced when trying to manage projects across many different vendors, and wanted to simplify the process for his customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s say you want a new generator,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst you go to Home Depot to buy it. Then you have to hire an electrician. Then get a propane guy. Then file permits. Then all of a sudden you have to manage it all yourself and you run into this\u00a0calendar roulette, wondering whether or not it is\u00a0actually going to happen. So we\u2019ve built everything under our umbrella.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Building the Right Team<\/h2>\n<p>Nick can execute projects like this because of his team, which he likens to \u201cSeal Team Six\u201d, the Navy\u2019s special forces division known for being versatile.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe take on the funky, we take on the challenge, and we flourish. We take a lot of pride in our work,\u201d says Nick. \u201cOur staff is well-rounded,\u201d he continues. \u201cEach employee fulfills a different area. It makes us agile. Everything from businesses and office buildings, electrical vehicle charging, generators, and residential\u00a0projects. With the team we\u2019ve built, we can really do anything that has wires.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe take on the funky, we take on the challenge, and we flourish. We take a lot of pride in our work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/884fd528-05df-41d9-85ac-2bf69e8b2e35_14064236_1100783716681178_6381673479411341300_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"720\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Nick and the Hitchcock &amp; Company team.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Building that team took time. He started by finding an ideal right-hand person. \u201cIt took me a good ten years to find the right-fit number-two guy. It is a little bit of a mill, where you go through people before you find the good number two.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, the effort paid off, and he found the reliable team member he needed. \u201cNow he runs most of the service work,\u201d Nick says.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting an edge with technology<\/h2>\n<p>Hitchcock &amp; Company has also made investments in technology to give them an edge. They were early adopters of Slack, a\u00a0texting and collaboration software, and Trello, a\u00a0project management tool. But things really started to improve when they switched to <a href=\"https:\/\/getjobber.com\/\">Jobber<\/a>. \u201cWe had hired more people, and we needed to streamline and be more efficient.\u201d The piecemeal tech stack he had cobbled together was\u00a0no longer robust enough for the larger team.<\/p>\n<p>Now they run most of their business through Jobber, from estimates, to scheduling, to invoicing, to customer support. They even accept credit cards through <a href=\"https:\/\/getjobber.com\/features\/payments\/\">Jobber Payments<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoving to Jobber has given me better metrics: billable time on projects, how much time we\u2019re spending traveling, tracking expenses with the expense pad,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cThose things help dial in the efficiency of the business.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Productivity improvements with Jobber<\/h2>\n<p>With Jobber, Hitchcock &amp; Company\u2019s productivity improved significantly. They started using Map View to plan the most efficient travel routes and bundle customers in close proximity into adjacent timeslots.<\/p>\n<p>The result was surprising, even to Nick, who says, \u201cWe cut down on drive time and cut down on wasted time, which gives us a leg up to the point where we were so much more efficient \u2014 it sounds crazy \u2014 we lowered our service charge for certain items.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jobber also helps Hitchcock &amp; Company manage cash flow by scheduling ongoing service calls on a recurring basis. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the strengths of Jobber: it automatically sends a reminder for recurring service visits. The invoices are already half built. Now we\u2019re more proactive than reactive.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>With Jobber, \u201cwe cut down on drive time and cut down on wasted time, which gives us a leg up to the point where we were so much more efficient we lowered our service charge.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/d02083c8-c92e-484d-9091-0ca8696dc8ad_Hitchcock203.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Funding Growth with Fundbox<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes, the revenue from operations isn\u2019t enough for Hitchcock &amp; Company to build for the future. In those cases, Nick turns to Fundbox.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA lot of contractors use the deposit from one job to pay for another job. And that\u2019s suicide!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA lot of contractors use the deposit from one job to pay for another job. And that\u2019s suicide,\u201d he explains. He prefers to draw funds from his Fundbox line of credit. \u201cThen I\u2019m not robbing Peter to pay Paul for a job.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Usually, Nick taps into his Fundbox Credit when he is investing in growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve used Fundbox to pay for infrastructure upgrades twice. We\u2019ve also done marketing campaigns with it. We do a lot on Facebook, Google, a new website rebuild. We ran\u00a0a holiday lights competition and used Fundbox money to run the campaign. That\u2019s not money I want to pull out of the cash kitty at the end of the year.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We ran a holiday lights competition and used Fundbox money to run the campaign.
