According to CB Insights, it\u2019s \u201ca list of 250 of the most promising private companies applying a mix of software and technology to transform the financial services industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a press release, CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal said: \u201cThe financial services industry will see more change in the next 10 years than it has in the last 100. And that transformation is being driven by a group of smart insurgent startup companies. The Fintech 250 are the most promising of these insurgents. They are bringing emerging technologies and business models to financial services that will permanently change the way we handle money and do business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbinsights.com\/research\/fintech-250-startups-most-promising\/\"><b>Get the full Fintech 250 list here.<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9656\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9656\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FINTECH-250-Market-Map-2018.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9656\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FINTECH-250-Market-Map-2018.png\" alt=\"The CB Insights Fintech 250 2018\" width=\"600\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FINTECH-250-Market-Map-2018.png 1822w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FINTECH-250-Market-Map-2018-768x647.png 768w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/FINTECH-250-Market-Map-2018-1536x1295.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9656\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The CB Insights Fintech 250 &#8211; Click to enlarge<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Forbes: What Banks Can Learn From The Happiest Place On Earth<\/h2>\n<p>This month, Sebastian Rymarz, who is Chief Business Officer for Fundbox (overseeing Marketing, Sales, Business and Corporate Development), published a new article in Forbes: \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2018\/07\/13\/what-banks-can-learn-from-the-happiest-place-on-earth\/#1afecd67eecc\">What Banks Can Learn From The Happiest Place On Earth<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the article, he points out how major consumer brands (like Disney, for example) are using data in new and creative ways to better personalize customer experiences. The banking industry, he says, could learn a lot from the example of forward-thinking consumer brands when it comes to the innovative application of behavioral data.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent global study, a majority of those surveyed claimed that &#8220;they would switch brands or vendors if communications weren\u2019t personalized.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According the Rymarz, the message is clear: \u201cConsumers have demanded a more intimate, individualized experience. Consumer brands like Disney are responding to that desire with AI-enabled, behavior-based personalization of experiences in real-time. Translated to the world of banking, providing a more individualized experience for customers means providing services that are available when and where users are at all times\u2014and one that is tailored to their preferences whenever they are logged in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2018\/07\/13\/what-banks-can-learn-from-the-happiest-place-on-earth\/#1afecd67eecc\"><b>Read the full article on Forbes.<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Small Business Edge: Small Business and Credit<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9655\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Rose-on-Small-Business-Edge.png\" alt=\"Rose Zhong on Small Business Edge\" width=\"599\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Rose-on-Small-Business-Edge.png 1170w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Rose-on-Small-Business-Edge-768x300.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rose Zhong, VP for Finance at Fundbox, made a guest appearance on episode 9 of the Small Business Edge podcast.<\/p>\n<p>For this episode, she chatted with host Brian Moran about small business credit, how to manage it, and how small business owners should think about their long-term credit strategies in the context of running their companies.
