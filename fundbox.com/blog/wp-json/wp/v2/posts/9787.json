Disorganized files and haphazard systems can only make effective team collaboration more difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a look at five common barriers to collaboration, as well as strategies for working through them.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Missing documents<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>From finding an email attachment you received several weeks ago and forgot to download to managing multiple versions of the same document, handling digital or even hard copy files has gotten complicated!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The solution: <\/span>Cloud-based document storage can help you locate files across multiple devices and ensure that everyone on your team can access the files they need.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. \u00a0Vague expectations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When team members don\u2019t know when something is due or what tasks they\u2019re specifically responsible for, they\u2019re unlikely to follow through.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The solution:<\/span>\u00a0Using a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/project-estimates\">project estimate<\/a><\/span>\u00a0gets everybody on the same page right from the outset. Follow up with a detailed project plan. The ability to look up a deadline or download a file rather than sending an email to ask also helps avoid unnecessary delays.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. \u00a0Missed deadlines<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Projects can grind to a screeching halt when tasks are dependent on work from someone else but the other person drops the ball. That can set off a domino effect of more missed deadlines, which is frustrating for everyone involved.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The solution:<\/span>\u00a0Automated reminders for upcoming tasks can lift the project management burden and keep team members accountable.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. \u00a0Scope creep<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When a client asks for work beyond what\u2019s in your original agreement, that\u2019s called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/fighting-scope-creep-freelance-creatives\">scope creep<\/a><\/span>. It\u2019s not such a big deal if you bill by the hour, because your pay scales up as the project gets bigger, but if you bill in flat project fees, you lose money every time you agree to an extra revision or provide something that\u2019s outside the project\u2019s original scope.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The solution:<\/span>\u00a0Discuss changes in scope with your client and alert them that you\u2019re need to bill for additional work. If you bill in project fees based on the number of hours you expect a project to take, then tracking your time can help you provide accurate estimates going forward.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Disagreement about what\u2019s owed<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s imagine that\u00a0you reach the end of a project. In your mind, you\u2019ve done everything agreed upon. In their mind, they\u2019re expecting something more. Maybe they thought their website would include SEO-optimized copy and social media share buttons. Or they wanted their blog post to include photos and social media copy but they failed to articulate that expectation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The solution:<\/span>\u00a0Discuss the details of each project, including timelines, project specifications, number of revisions and deliverables, <em>before<\/em> you get started. Your contract should include a detailed contract or scope of work (SOW) so that you can refer back to the SOW if disagreements pop up later.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Foster smooth relationships<br \/>\n<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Being professional and organized can go a long way towards easing many of these pain points, as well as maintaining great client relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Using the right tools can take the pressure off you as an individual and help remove many of the barriers listed above.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This guest post was written by Susan Johnston Taylor of FreshBooks for Fundbox. <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">FreshBooks<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0makes invoicing and accounting painless for millions of small business owners. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even if you run your own business, you still have to collaborate with others, whether it\u2019s clients, subcontractors, employees, or &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":81,"featured_media":9791,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[],"yst_prominent_words":[5957,723,1248,2403,6322,4347,3037,985,9354,2336,9355,5153,5151,794,1149,9356,3101,3673,9307,3090],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Overcome the 5 Most Common Barriers to Collaboration | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Even if you run your own business, you still have to collaborate with others, whether it\u2019s clients, subcontractors, employees, or vendors.
