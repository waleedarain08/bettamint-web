Starting at $4 a month, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/self-employed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create and send invoices on the go<\/a><u>,<\/u> and if you enable online payments, you can get paid by credit card or bank transfer.<a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> QuickBooks Online<\/a>, on the other hand, is a more immersive option for small businesses. It allows you\u2014or maybe <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/when-to-hire-a-bookkeeper\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a bookkeeper<\/a>\u2014to gain access to the platform from any device.

Hiveage offers business owners the ability <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiveage.com\/manage-multiple-teams-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to share invoicing functions among employees<\/a> or manage invoicing for more than one company from a single account.
