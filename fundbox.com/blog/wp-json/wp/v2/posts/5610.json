Try having some employees blog for your business. Blogging can help them learn more about your products and services. Blogging can also help salespeople craft a better pitch for their sales meetings.<\/li>\n<li>Blogging gets prospective clients to come to your business website more often and spend more time there. The more a prospect explores your website and what you have to offer, the more interested he or she will be in purchasing your products or services.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure at the end of a blog, you offer clients the ability to comment, ask questions, or request more information. Encourage discussion by ending your blog with an appeal for opinions. Build a community and accumulate more leads by blogging about topics important to your business and industry.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Some B2B blogs can be dry.

Write at their professional level.<\/li>\n<li>Make predictions. Predictive blogs generate lots of sharing activity.<\/li>\n<li>Get to the bottom line (which is almost always cost savings).<\/li>\n<li>Be an expert.
