Unfortunately for many small business owners, the business loan process can end up being a roadblock to success.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/medialibrary\/media\/smallbusiness\/2015\/Report-SBCS-2015.pdf\">2015 small business credit survey<\/a><\/span>\u00a0by the Federal Reserve, only 50% of financing applicants were approved for the full amount for which they applied. This means that half of small business owners <em>didn\u2019t<\/em> receive the funding they needed to grow or maintain their business.<\/p>\n<p>These numbers may sound dismal, but if you are a small business owner in need of a business loan, don\u2019t lose hope. An insufficient application and lack of preparedness are two of the major reasons why loan applications are denied. But there are simple steps that you can take to prepare for the business loan process and help it run more smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these expert tips to put your best foot forward when it comes to applying for a small business loan.<\/p>\n<h2>Things to know about business loans<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What kind of loan you need<\/span>: there are many loan options available to small business owners today. More choice is always a good thing when it comes to finding business funding, but it can be difficult to figure out which loan is right for you. Fortunately, there are resources such as <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-loans\/guides\/business-loan-application\">this simple quiz<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to point you in the right direction.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What you will use the loan for<\/span>: lenders will want to know your specific plan for the implementation of your new funds. Whether you are hiring more employees, expanding to another location, getting new equipment, or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-loans\/guides\/inventory-financing\">purchasing inventory<\/a><\/span>, you should know exactly what the money is going to accomplish.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How much capital you need<\/span>: just as it\u2019s important not to ask for too little, it\u2019s important not to ask for too much. Lenders expect a return on their investment (you), and if your requested loan amount is falling too far on either end of the spectrum, your application will come across as ill-prepared or na\u00efve. Either on your own or with an accountant, forecast your revenue and profit quarterly to predict how much funding you\u2019ll need and when.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You have capacity to pay back the loan<\/span>: both you and your lender should be confident that you can realistically pay back your loan. If you can prove this in your application, you have a much better chance of being approved for your desired loan. Because you know how much you are asking for and what you are using the money for, you should be able to forecast your return on investment and predict when you\u2019ll be able to pay back your loan.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Things to prepare ahead of time<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest key to having a smooth and successful business loan process is to have detailed information about your business prepared.
