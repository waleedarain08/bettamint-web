Or maybe that ghost you swear has been haunting your colder-than-imaginable office all summer will finally decide to reveal itself to you. Then there are zombies, so many zombies.<\/p>\n<p>During the Halloween season, there\u2019s no shortage of monsters, goblins and other ghouls trying their best to catch you off guard and spook you\u2014\u2018tis the season, after all.<\/p>\n<p>As a small business owner, however, you pride yourself on remaining calm, cool and collected in all situations. So when your staff transforms the office into a Haunted House to celebrate the Halloween holiday, you try your best to act nonchalantly when you run into the severed spines, brains coming out of skulls and mummies that your employees have so masterfully hidden around the office.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps the scariest thing you may encounter at the office during the Halloween season isn\u2019t a crazy scarecrow, demonic jack-o\u2019-lantern or even anything of the like. Quite simply, if you\u2019re not paying attention to your company\u2019s cash flow, you may let out an earth-rattling shriek when you\u2019re presented with a new opportunity and take a peek at your finances to see if you\u2019re able to pursue it.<\/p>\n<p>In order to eliminate the possibility your cash flow will come back to haunt you later on, there\u2019s no better time than the present to assess your cash flow situation and see where your small business stands now, as well as where it might stand six months from now. That way, if it appears your cash flow is dying, you can take steps right away to nurse it back to life before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to assess your company\u2019s finances is to prepare a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-small-business-needs-a-cash-flow-statement\/\">statement of cash flows<\/a> (if you haven\u2019t already). Once you\u2019ve put that together, you\u2019re able to quickly gauge how much cash your business is bringing in and how much it\u2019s paying out. You can then begin drilling deep into the numbers to see exactly what\u2019s what.<\/p>\n<p>For example, once you\u2019ve determined your business\u2019 operating cash flow (i.e., the cash you generate from your day-to-day operations) you can then divide that number by your company\u2019s revenue to determine exactly how much you\u2019re profiting on sales. If that fraction is lower than you\u2019d like it to be and your company\u2019s cash flow is drying up, it might be time to <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-raise-rates-without-ruining-your-client-relationships\/\">raise prices,<\/a> incentivize your customers to pay their bills earlier or use a service like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_medium=content&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dont-let-your-cash-flow-spook-you-later-this-year\/\">Fundbox<\/a> so you can access the money you need to pursue new opportunities (e.g., releasing new products or launching new marketing blitzes).<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/making-sense-cash-flow-statement-part-1\/\">cash flow statement<\/a> also helps determine your business\u2019 free cash flow, or the difference between your company\u2019s operating cash flow and the money it spends on capital expenditures. The higher this number is the better. So if your free cash flow is scary low, it\u2019s probably time to go back to the drawing board to see how you\u2019re able to inflate it\u2014which isn\u2019t as hard as it sounds. For example, do you know if you\u2019re getting the best deal on electricity? If you live in a state where energy\u2019s been deregulated (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.constellation.com\/energy-101\/energy-choice\/what-is-energy-deregulation.html\">here\u2019s a list<\/a>), you\u2019ll probably be able to save money on generation costs by switching providers.<\/p>\n<p>October can be a hectic month because you never know when Frankenstein might jump out at you. But by being proactive with your cash flow management, you\u2019re able to keep the things that might scare you around the office to a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Halloween!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s certainly not uncommon to get startled this time of year.
