While the buzz of \u201cgoing green\u201d may have faded a bit in recent years, the reasons to celebrate Earth Day and have an earth-friendly business are more important than ever. Earth Day is the perfect time to review your small business\u2019s operating plan with an environmentally conscious eye and see where you may be able to make changes that will not only help your business\u2019s bottom line, but help the environment, too. Here are a few areas to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Become more energy-efficient<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making your commercial office, home office, or retail shop more energy-efficient isn\u2019t as difficult as it may seem. It may only require small tweaks to things you are already doing. Some possibilities include changing out regular light bulbs with their energy-efficient counterparts, using power-saving settings on office computers, and upgrading to a programmable thermostat.

Go paperless<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/10655-paperless-office.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going paperless<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 or even moving to a more \u201cpaper-reduced\u201d business \u2014 comes with significant environmental benefits while saving money for your business. With the cloud-based technology we have today, going paperless is no longer unachievable. In fact, you probably already have a good deal of the technology needed for a paperless office in place. With some changes, such as moving all contracts and invoicing to a secure online platform, you can slowly move your business closer to a paperless state.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Allow telecommuting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telecommuting is good for the environment, saves your employees money, and reduces overhead expenses in your business \u2014 and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apollotechnical.com\/working-from-home-productivity-statistics\/#:~:text=Several%20studies%20over%20the%20past,and%20are%2047%25%20more%20productive.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">productivity increases <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when employees work remotely. The past couple of years have necessitated a work-from-home status for many of us, and now both employers and employees are anticipating this trend will continue. If it works in your business, you can create a telecommuting policy that allows your employees to work remotely on a part-time basis. Offering this type of benefit can even help you attract and retain talent in your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Set the expectations for your team<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going green only works with consistent effort from everyone on your team, so you need to get your entire staff on board. Set office-wide rules for recycling, conserving energy by shutting off lights, and guidelines for purchasing supplies and working with vendors. You may also want to give your employees a chance to weigh in and offer their own suggestions for creating an earth-friendly office. You can even consider offering an incentive for the best green idea for the office or an award to one employee a month who goes above and beyond in improving the eco-consciousness of your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your business \u2014 and the environment \u2014 will get the most benefit when you focus on implementing these ideas all year long, so celebrate Earth Day and use it as a catalyst for creating your \u201cgo green\u201d plan. Start rolling out environmentally friendly changes in your business this year!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
