If you\u2019re an experienced marketer, it will help you to refocus your efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a recap of Tina\u2019s recommendations of the essential components of any small business marketing program that anyone can implement:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Started by Identifying Your Ideal Customer<\/strong><br \/>\nKick-starting any marketing program is hard. But Tina recommends a couple of simple exercises that can help \u2013 1) <strong>identifying your ideal customer<\/strong> so that you can focus your marketing activities where you\u2019re going to get the biggest reward\u00a0and 2) <strong>developing a 60 second business story<\/strong> that gives customers a compelling reason to do business with you.<\/p>\n<p>What is an ideal customer? Well, this is the person who not only wants to do business with you, but who YOU want to do business with. Finding that customer can help your bottom line by focusing your marketing activities on reaching the most profitable group. To find your ideal customer, start by identifying 5-10 descriptive terms that paint a picture of that person. To speed up the process, pull terms from these four buckets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Demographic<\/strong>: Male, female, income, age, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Neighborhood, city, state, everywhere, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interests<\/strong>: Hobbies, affinities, clubs, associations, etc.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Life events and stages<\/strong>: Engaged, married, expecting, retired, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Look for patterns and usual suspects and ignore the exceptions. Here\u2019s an example of an ideal customer called \u201cSusie\u2019s Garden Shop.\u201d Her customer is probably a woman between 30 and 50, with a family income of over $75,000 who lives within 20 miles of her shop and enjoys gardening and buys gardening supplies every spring.<\/p>\n<p>Defining your ideal customer is only half of getting started, you\u2019ll also need to talk about your business in a way that\u2019s going to make this customer want to do business with you. You need a 60 second story. Follow the following flow to create yours (Susie\u2019s business story thrown in to demonstrate how it comes together):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What do you do<\/strong>? \u201c<em>I have a garden shop<\/em>\u201d (be simple and concrete as possible).<\/li>\n<li><strong>What problem do you solve?<\/strong> \u201c<em>I sell specialty and exotic plants<\/em>\u201d (focus on the one problem that you solve better than anyone else)<\/li>\n<li><strong>How your business is different?<\/strong> \u201c<em>The plants I sell are not in big box stores<\/em>\u201d (for most small business owners the key difference between you and your competitor is you your personality, years in business, community relationships, and so on)<\/li>\n<li><strong>What is their happily ever after?\u00a0<\/strong>How is your customer\u2019s life different after doing business with you? \u201c<em>They can have the garden of their dreams.<\/em>\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And there\u2019s your 60 second story: \u201c<em>I am Susie, I have a garden shop that sells specialty and exotic plants that aren\u2019t available in big box stores, so that my customers can have the garden of their dreams<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But knowing who your ideal customer is and knowing what you\u2019re going to say to them isn\u2019t enough, this leads us to step two. You need to get your business online so that your ideal customer can find you and learn about your business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Your Business Online<\/strong><br \/>\n97% of Internet users search for local businesses online, but getting online means having more than just a website. Tina stresses three areas to focus your efforts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Have control of your business listing<\/strong> \u2013 This is a free and easy way to get your business online and help customers find you across sites like Google, Bing, and YP as well as review sites like Yelp, and social sites like Facebook. If your business is listed \u2013 claim your listing and make sure it\u2019s accurate. If you\u2019re not listed, get on there ASAP. At a minimum, Tina suggests controlling your business listing across the top five publishers \u2013 Google+, Facebook, YP.com, Yahoo and Yelp. To do this, go to each site, search for your business, then claim your business listing if it exists or add it if it does not.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get a mobile responsive website<\/strong> \u2013 This means having a site that\u2019s designed to fit and be easy to navigate on a small screen. A responsive site will make it easier for customers to contact you once they find you online. You can easily check whether your site is responsive by visiting your site, and zooming your browser out until you\u2019re looking at your website at 27-33% of your normal size. If your site looks the same as it did at 100% or the content moved around or changed order then it\u2019s likely to be mobile responsive, if it\u2019s just a smaller version, it isn\u2019t \u2013 talk to your webmaster about getting it updated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your website for search engines <\/strong>\u2013 This is a big topic and hard to cover in its entirety, but Tina offered some great tips for determining the following:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is your site optimized?<\/strong> Can Google find your site? Head on over to Google and search for \u201csite:\u201d then your URL, for example: \u201csite:fundbox.com\u201d. If your site doesn\u2019t show up then Google doesn\u2019t know your site exists. If your site does show up, look for how many pages Google indexes (or how many pages of your site are findable). If you\u2019re within a 10% difference, say you have 50 pages and Google finds 45, you\u2019re in a good place. If it\u2019s over a 20% difference, then you have work to do.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is your site optimized accurately?<\/strong> Does Google think your site is relevant for the terms that your ideal customer is going to use to find you? Think about the words or phrases that customers use to search for businesses like yours and compare these with the words on your website \u2013 both in your main content but also in meta-tags and title tags.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is your site optimized effectively to get you to the top of the results?<\/strong> Does Google think your site is important? This comes down to how unique your content is and how many other sites reference that content (backlinks). It can be hard to perfect this task and an SEO consultant can help, but Tina recommends focusing your efforts on ensuring that when people search for your business by its name, that your site pops up at number one in the search results. This is where your third party business listings, keywords, and tags can help.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Getting Leads<\/strong><br \/>\nJust being online isn\u2019t always enough, you may be getting customers but not at the volume needed to grow your business. This in when investing in advertising makes the most sense. Tina suggests starting small (you don\u2019t need a huge budget), making your campaign measurable (tracking clicks, site impressions, etc.), and providing compelling calls to action (downloads, registrations, bookings, etc.). Your campaign should also be reproducible so that you can roll out the same message and actions across multiple media instead of being all over the place.

How do you turn customers into fans? Well you keep in touch on social media, you reward loyalty with volume discounts or membership perks, and you make it easy for customers to refer your business.

As you review your program, start by measuring the effectiveness of the source of your leads. You could do this by simply asking new customers how they heard about you. For some rock solid data, consider using unique phone lines for certain campaigns and track how effective the enquiries to that line have been. You can do the same with unique URLs to track the success of digital programs (use Google Tag Manager to create these).<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re tracking your marketing programs you can make smart decisions on how to optimize your marketing spend \u2013whether it\u2019s by improving what you\u2019re already doing, adding new media, new campaigns, or more money, or dropping tactics that don\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Tip<\/em><\/strong>: Each of the five steps above is intended to build on each other and work together, although you can use them in the order that makes most sense for you.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re looking for a one-of-a-kind, step-by-step overview of how to put a repeatable kick-ass
