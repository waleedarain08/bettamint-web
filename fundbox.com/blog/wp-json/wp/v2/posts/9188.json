Not only do small businesses create a ton of jobs, we all rely on them in our day-to-day lives. They\u2019re your favorite restaurant, the person who plows your driveway, the neighborhood market you shop at, the team that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-you-need-to-know-about-opening-a-house-painting-business\/\">paints your house<\/a><\/span>, your barber.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/nsbw\/about\">Since 1963<\/a><\/span>, America has honored its small businesses during <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/nsbw\/nsbw\">National Small Business Week<\/a><\/span>, which will be celebrated April 29\u2013May 5 this year. National Small Business Week is an annual celebration of over 28 million entrepreneurs and small business owners in the United States.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/600x100-blog@1x.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9147\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/600x100-blog@1x.png\" alt=\"Fundbox Celebrates National Small Business Week 2018\" width=\"600\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great time to be a small business owner, and there are lots of ways to join in.<\/p>\n<p>Small business <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/\">happenings<\/a><\/span>\u00a0will take place across the country during the week, including events and training sessions for small business owners, both online and in-person.<\/p>\n<p>Do you own a small business and want to know what your company can do to celebrate Small Business Week this year?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ideas for inspiration:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Host a networking event<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Prove your small business is a leader among your peers by planning and hosting a networking event that brings nearby entrepreneurs and small business staff together to get to know one another, learn new things and make new friends.<\/p>\n<p>You never know when a networking event can lead to a new partnership or new clients (or at least high-quality leads).<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, you will generate some buzz and raise brand awareness simply by hosting the event.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Celebrate your employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Where would your small business be without the help of your employees?<\/p>\n<p>Small Business Week presents the perfect opportunity to show your employees how much you appreciate their hard work.<\/p>\n<p>So plan a company outing or host a party. You could also take your team out for dinner and drinks\u2014or hire a bartender and caterer to serve you for a few hours in the office.<\/p>\n<p>Not sure what your team will want to do? The easiest way to find out is by asking them directly.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Show your customers you appreciate them, too<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While you\u2019re at it, use Small Business Week to show your customers how awesome they are. How exactly can you do that? Here are several ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give away some swag if you have it.<\/li>\n<li>Announce a brand-new customer loyalty program.<\/li>\n<li>Send handwritten notes to some of your best customers.<\/li>\n<li>Invite customers to a company-sponsored happy hour.<\/li>\n<li>Showcase customer spotlight stories on your blog and promote them on social media.<\/li>\n<li>Put together a short thank-you video featuring your employees.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your business wouldn\u2019t be as successful as it is without your awesome customers. You don\u2019t have to do anything major, but a small gesture can go a long way toward increasing loyalty.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Launch a contest or giveaway to engage your audience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Small Business Week is also a great time to launch a contest on social media to raise brand awareness and gain more followers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could give the 100th or 1000th new person to follow your Twitter account a bag full of swag\u2014or something even better (like a gift certificate to a restaurant or a weekend getaway somewhere). Depending on the products you sell, you could also launch a photo contest, encouraging your followers to send in pictures of your products taken in exotic or unusual places (for example, a coffee mug with your logo on it on a mountain top).<\/p>\n<p>Check out <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/5-awesome-social-media-contests-plus-create\/\">this Hootsuite post<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for examples of successful social media contests.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/shutterstock_385167373.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9192\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/shutterstock_385167373.jpg\" alt=\"Launch or re-launch your company blog\" width=\"601\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/shutterstock_385167373.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/shutterstock_385167373-768x558.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Launch (or re-launch) your company blog<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>For the last few years, you\u2019ve been telling yourself you were going to start blogging regularly for your small business.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.<\/p>\n<p>Small Business Week is a great time to launch your business blogging efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Companies that blog regularly get <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\">much more traffic<\/a><\/span>\u00a0than their peers that don\u2019t. In addition to fulfilling your goal, you\u2019re also likely to get many more qualified leads.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Support other small businesses near you<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The weeklong small business celebration isn\u2019t confined exclusively to your company.<\/p>\n<p>Use the time to show the other small businesses in your community how much you appreciate what they do. Here are some ways you can do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take your team out for lunch a few times during the week at different restaurants and cafes. Ask your employees where they\u2019d like to go the most.<\/li>\n<li>Buy several gift certificates from several different stores near you and give them out to your team. Play games or have a contest and award the winners (though you should give something to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all <\/span>your employees).<\/li>\n<li>Instead of using a megastore like Amazon or Staples, support a neighborhood office supply store\u2014even if it is a little\u00a0less\u00a0convenient.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You know your neighborhood the best. It\u2019s never too early to start thinking about which companies your own could bring a little extra business to during Small Business Week.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to support other small businesses? Partner with a complementary business in your area or industry. There are many ways to collaborate. You could co-host an event or run a campaign to promote the mutual benefits of your products, with a promotion thrown in. Banding together is a great way to quickly reach new audiences.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Invest in new tools and technologies<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Is your business still relying on outdated systems and tools? If so, it\u2019s a perfect time to reassess the technologies your small business runs on to see whether any investments might transform your company. You might want to add something like&#8230;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">A new collaboration tool.<\/span>\u00a0For example, modern <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">collaboration tools<\/span>\u00a0and messaging platforms can increase your team\u2019s productivity by making it easier for employees to find the information they\u2019re looking for and tackle group projects with their colleagues\u2014from any location.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">A more modern payment system.<\/span>\u00a0If you own a\u00a0business\u00a0that either pays or gets paid on net terms, using a service like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundboxpay.com\">Fundbox Pay<\/a><\/span>\u00a0can improve your cash flow. If you\u2019re a seller using Fundbox Pay, you\u2019ll get paid immediately at the moment of sale. Buyers paying with Fundbox Pay, get convenient net-60 terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Small Business Week is a great time to launch something new that will pay off in improved productivity or smoother transactions in the future.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Reorganize your office<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just because your office has been in disarray for quite some time doesn\u2019t mean it has to stay that way forever.<\/p>\n<p>Clutter causes fatigue. If your workspace could use a clean-up, Small Business Week is a perfect excuse to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2015\/01\/30\/pf\/jobs\/desk-organized-tips\/index.html\">organize your desk<\/a><\/span>. Once you\u2019ve taken care of your own space, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/productivity\/21-tips-to-organize-your-office-and-get-more-done.html\">tidy up the entire office<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Clean workspaces are linked to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/indigo-triplett\/creating-a-clutter-free-mind-by-creating-a-clutter-free-space.html\">improved morale and increased productivity<\/a><\/span>.
