It provides coverage to small businesses for claims resulting from bodily injury, property damage, copyright infringement, and reputation harm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look more closely at what general liability insurance covers, what it doesn\u2019t cover, and who needs it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is General Liability Insurance?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General liability insurance coverage protects your business from some of the most common claims <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/llc-business-taxes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business owners face<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Paying for any one of these would be incredibly expensive without some kind of business insurance to cover you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-party bodily injury<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a brick-and-mortar business and a customer is injured at your store, you\u2019re responsible for covering their medical costs. Not to mention, if it\u2019s determined that the accident is your fault, that customer could decide to sue you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And unfortunately, these types of accidents are not uncommon. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.thehartford.com\/newsroom-home\/news-releases\/news-releases-details\/2015\/The-Hartford-Reports-More-Than-40-Percent-Of-Small-Businesses-Will-Experience-A-Claim-In-The-Next-10-Years\/default.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to The Hartford<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 10% of businesses have a customer slip and fall on their premises, and these accidents cost about $30,000 to resolve. General liability insurance will cover any costs involved with a customer accident.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third-party property damage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property damage is another common liability claim. This happens when a customer\u2019s property is damaged while they are at your business or when a customer\u2019s property is damaged while you\u2019re visiting them on business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example of this is a general contractor accidentally damaging a client\u2019s property while working on their home. As a business owner, you\u2019re responsible for paying for the necessary repairs. General liability insurance will cover some or all of the associated costs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copyright infringement<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copyright infringement happens when you\u2019re accused of stealing someone else\u2019s ideas and using them in your marketing or advertising. It can also involve claims that you copied another company\u2019s product and sold it as your own. This can be an expensive problem to fix, especially if it leads to a lawsuit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reputation harm<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reputation harm happens when you make a public statement about a business owner that hurts their business. According to The Hartford, reputation management is the most expensive problem most businesses encounter and can cost up to $50,000 to fix.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Isn\u2019t Covered By Business Liability Insurance?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business liability insurance is a comprehensive insurance policy that covers some of the most common incidents business owners face. But it doesn\u2019t cover everything, and knowing what isn\u2019t covered is just as important as knowing what is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, no insurance policy is the same, so you should check the policy guidelines for your general liability insurance policy. But here are some of the most common exclusions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Auto accidents:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> general liability insurance doesn\u2019t cover auto accidents that happen while you or your employees are on the job. Commercial auto insurance can protect you from these types of accidents.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Employee injuries: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee becomes injured as a result of their work, general liability insurance doesn\u2019t cover that either. Workers\u2019 compensation insurance protects employees from workplace accidents or illnesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Damage to your property:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> General liability insurance protects you from damage to a customer\u2019s property, but it won\u2019t protect you from your own property damage. Commercial property insurance can help with that.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Professional errors:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Finally, general liability insurance won\u2019t cover you if a customer sues you due to a professional error that harms their business. Professional liability insurance will help with that.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it\u2019s always a good idea to be aware of the coverage limits on your general liability policy. If you feel like your coverage is a bit low, it may be worthwhile to purchase a commercial umbrella insurance policy to cover more expensive claims.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Much Coverage Do I Need?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insureon.com\/small-business-insurance\/general-liability\/cost\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Insureon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, most small businesses choose a standard coverage limit of $1 million per occurrence with a $2 million aggregate policy limit. So for a single claim, you\u2019ll receive up to $1 million with a $2 million limit for that policy period.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you will have to pay the insurance deductible before the insurance company will payout on your claim. You\u2019ll choose your deductible when you initially purchase general liability insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The size of your deductible, the type of business you run, and your industry will all affect your monthly insurance rate. Insureon also found that the median cost of general liability insurance is $42 per month or $500 annually.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who Needs General Liability Insurance?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most states won\u2019t require business owners to carry small business liability insurance, so you can purchase this insurance at your own discretion. But if you choose to forgo general liability insurance, you could be putting your business and your livelihood at risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is, most businesses need general liability insurance, especially if you own an office or storefront that\u2019s open to customers or vendors. And some clients may not want to do business with you unless you can show proof of insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should strongly consider purchasing business liability insurance if any of the following apply to your business:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have a store or office building that\u2019s open to clients, customers, or vendors<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You regularly do work on a client\u2019s physical property<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You regularly create advertising or marketing campaigns for your business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You use social media for advertising your business and communicating with customers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You rent or own commercial property<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General liability insurance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can save you from some of the most common accidents small businesses face. Suppose a customer is injured at your workplace, or you accidentally damage their property. In that case, business liability insurance will protect you from any medical bills and lawsuits that arise as a result.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQs<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do I need liability insurance for my small business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most small businesses can benefit from general liability insurance. It is relatively inexpensive to purchase, and it can protect you financially if you\u2019re ever involved in a lawsuit or if a customer is injured on your property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate an office or storefront that\u2019s open to customers, work on a customer\u2019s property, or own commercial property, you should probably purchase small business liability insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does general liability insurance cover for a small business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General liability insurance covers claims related to the following incidents:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Bodily injury:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A customer has an accident or is injured on your business premises.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Property damage: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You accidentally damage a customer\u2019s property during business operations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Copyright infringement:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You\u2019re accused of stealing another company\u2019s ideas and using them in a marketing or advertising campaign.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Reputation harm: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re accused of slandering another company, and it damages their business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i>Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
