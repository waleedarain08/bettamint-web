It\u2019s a tough question but an important one.<\/p>\n<p>Your most profitable clients are about more than billings \u2013 they value what you do. They also pay you on time, and they pay you what you charge (willingly). If you can find and keep profitable clients, you can make more money per project and enjoy a consistent stream of work, almost year-round.<\/p>\n<p>In the early stages of business ownership those clients aren\u2019t easy to spot. You\u2019re eager to take on new clients, perhaps you cast your net wide and are super excited if someone expresses an interest in your services. But not every customer is a profitable one, regardless of the potential billings. Some may not even be worth your time at all (<a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-fire-a-customer-or-client\/\">believe me you get to know the signs<\/a>) and it\u2019s worth having an <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-fire-a-customer-or-client\/\">exit strategy<\/a> up your sleeve.<\/p>\n<p>However, as your business grows, it becomes more critical that you start to understand what your most profitable clients look like so that you can keep nurturing those and go after similar accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Start by taking a look at your existing customers, this will help you get a sense of where your sweet spot is and how you bring value. For the most part, you\u2019ll quickly deduce that the 80\/20 rule applies and that most of your profits come from 20% of your clients.<\/p>\n<p>What makes those 20% uniquely special? You could consider demographic fundamentals such as their industry, size, the types of services you provide them with, etc. However, there are other unique characteristics that come into play that can help justify your premium pricing and, ultimately, enhance your profitability. These include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How well they pay versus the market rate\/your preferred rate.<\/strong>e. you\u2019re not always wrestling with pricing or proving your value.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Whether they refer you or, recommend your services<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Their track record of paying on time<\/strong>. Cash flow is king don\u2019t forget. <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/difference-between-small-business-profits-and-cash-flow\/\">You can have profitable clients, but if they don\u2019t pay you on time,<\/a> you\u2019re in trouble.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Are you their \u201cgo-to\u201d service provider? <\/strong>For example; You\u2019re apart of a stable of providers that they pick and choose from based on who knows what criteria.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They take full advantage of the range of services you offer<\/strong>. Meaning they are well aware of your entire skillset and service portfolio and put it to use.<\/li>\n<li><strong>They are great to work with.<\/strong> We all take on work that we sometimes would rather not, but for every \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cproblem\u201d client, you likely have a counterpoint client who treats you with respect, values your time, pays promptly, doesn\u2019t strong arm you into deadlines, and so on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your interactions are pleasant<\/strong>. Say no more, we all want to get along!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, I can\u2019t help you find your ideal client, but going through the above exercise will help you narrow down the characteristics of the ideal and most profitable customer profile.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, it\u2019s all about understanding why your clients buy from you and what motivates them to refer you. This knowledge gives you an advantage because you can continue to attract more business from that client (remember the 80\/20 rule), and attract more like them.<\/p>\n<p>Check out these other blogs for more tips on building your existing client base, dealing with troublesome clients, and being paid what you\u2019re worth:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/achieve-recurring-revenues\/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Ways Your Business Can Achieve Recurring Revenues<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-win-and-secure-a-great-retainer-agreement\/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Win and Secure a Great Retainer Agreement<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/difference-between-small-business-profits-and-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\">What\u2019s the Difference Between Small Business Profits and Cash Flow?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/handle-client-wont-pay-youre-worth\/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Handle a Client Who Won\u2019t Pay What You\u2019re Worth<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/turn-down-freelance-work-properly\/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Turn Down Work Properly and Profitably<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/avoid-underpricing-your-freelance-services\/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Avoid the Common Trap of Underpricing Your Services<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-set-your-freelance-rates\/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Set Your Freelance Rates, So That Everyone is Happy<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How do you spot a profitable client in a line up?
