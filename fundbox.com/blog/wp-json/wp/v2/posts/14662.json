To help you prepare, we talked with a handful of business experts about what to expect in 2021 and the near future. Here are five business trends and changes to look out for:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Remote work will be the new normal\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of remote workers around the world has been steadily growing for years, but 2020 saw a steep increase. Currently, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/siepr.stanford.edu\/research\/publications\/how-working-home-works-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">42% of the U.S. workforce works from home full time<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to a 2020 report from Stanford University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI see a permanent move toward online and remote work,\u201d said Michelle Diamond, the CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elevatediamondstrategy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elevate Diamond Strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an advisory firm that helps companies with growth strategy and execution.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses have figured out how to run their companies successfully in this new paradigm. And because of this, the model will remain after COVID-19 and beyond.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/running-business-remotely\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be challenging when it comes to collaboration and communication<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lp.buffer.com\/state-of-remote-work-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">majority of remote workers appreciate the flexibility<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> working from home provides. Plus, remote work means fewer overhead costs. Without an office space to pay for, you could build up your company savings or reinvest money back into your business by upgrading your software or increasing your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Digitization will accelerate\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses were forced to digitize their operations and services this year to accommodate customers, but the bar will be even higher in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/moving-business-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pivoting online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is no longer just a good idea\u2014it\u2019s quite literally essential,\u201d said Jeremy Moser, marketing expert and co-founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/userp.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uSERP<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a company that helps businesses get brand mentions and backlinks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only do customers expect businesses to have a greater online presence in 2021, they also expect a seamless digital experience. Sixty-eight percent of customers surveyed in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/c1.sfdcstatic.com\/content\/dam\/web\/en_us\/www\/documents\/research\/salesforce-state-of-the-connected-customer-4th-ed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce\u2019s State of the Connected Customer report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said COVID-19 raised their expectations for business\u2019s digital capabilities. That\u2019s especially true for millennials and Gen-Zers, the majority of whom prioritize convenience over brand, according to the report.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To create a convenient experience for your customers in 2021, it\u2019s crucial to operate with a digital-first mentality and provide options.

Empathy is the gold standard<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the stress and uncertainty of 2020, customers are looking for more than just quality products and services from businesses\u2014they\u2019re looking for compassion and empathy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf your brand lacks empathy, vision, and purpose, consumers won\u2019t resonate with your goals, and will actively look for competitors,\u201d said Moser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, customers are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zenogroup.com\/insights\/2020-zeno-strength-purpose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four times more likely to buy from and recommend a business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that has a strong, identifiable purpose, according to The 2020 Zeno Strength of Purpose study. A business\u2019s purpose includes its core values, business practices, customer service philosophy, and support for social causes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/adjusting-new-normal-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">build trust with customers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and create brand loyalty, you have to connect with their minds and hearts, Diamond said. \u201cCustomer connection is the only way businesses of the future will both survive and thrive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forging that connection means demonstrating empathy, and demonstrating empathy comes down to addressing your customers\u2019 needs and fears. To do that, you may have to tailor your products or services, reexamine your customer service policies, or use a more compassionate voice in your marketing materials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Financial focus will shift from growth to profitability<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As businesses recover from revenue losses and budget cuts in 2020, many business owners will take a more conservative approach to their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-to-clean-up-your-financials-before-the-new-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In previous years, much of my work with clients was centered on growth initiatives,\u201d said Diane Davidson, the owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cleverfoxadvisory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clever Fox Advisory<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an independent financial advisory firm.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCompanies had the appetite to take on projects that did not immediately have a positive ROI. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, they\u2019re focusing on their operations and taking stock of where they can optimize processes to save money.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial transformation projects, she said, can help reduce costs and keep <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cleverfoxadvisory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> steady. Think: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automating administrative tasks, consolidating software systems, renegotiating vendor contracts, or outsourcing tedious services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCompanies will also be more selective about which projects and programs they are going to undertake in 2021,\u201d said Davidson. To stay nimble and profitable, you may have to pare down your offerings and focus only on the services or products generating the most revenue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. More consumers will prioritize shopping small<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne major trend since the pandemic and leading into 2021 is the drive of consumers to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cleverfoxadvisory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">support small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and local economic growth,\u201d Moser said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After witnessing so many beloved local establishments struggle or close their doors in 2020, many customers have shifted their priorities. Now, 59% of consumers surveyed in Salesforce\u2019s report would rather <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cleverfoxadvisory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">buy from a small business than a large corporation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cConsumers are recognizing their ability to shift their own local economies in states, counties, and cities,\u201d said Moser.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For business owners, capitalizing on this trend requires investing in local marketing and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cleverfoxadvisory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he added. In addition to boosting your social media presence with local hashtags and campaigns, consider donating to a local cause or participating in a virtual community fundraiser or event.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get prepared now<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how your business fared in 2020, it\u2019s critical to begin preparing for 2021.
