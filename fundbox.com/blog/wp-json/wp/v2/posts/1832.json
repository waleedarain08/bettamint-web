He seemingly is never not working.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all worked 20 hours a day, and he worked 23 hours,\u201d Julie Ankenbrandt, who worked with him at the start-up X.com, said of him in the book.<\/p>\n<p>On vacation, Musk likely won\u2019t be found soaking up rays with a Mai Tai in hand. Kevin Hartz, an early PayPal investor, recalls a trip to Las Vegas with Musk, telling Vance, \u201cWe\u2019re all hanging out in this cabana at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Elon is there reading some obscure Soviet rocket manual that was all moldy and looked like it had been bought on eBay.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One reason the entrepreneur might be so reluctant to properly vacation derives from a trip to Brazil and South Africa 15 years ago, in which he contracted a malaria infection. \u201cThat\u2019s my lesson for taking a vacation,\u201d Musk said, half-jokingly perhaps, \u201cVacation will kill you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And Musk doesn\u2019t just demand that devotion to the job from himself, he expects his employees to be similarly passionate about their work. A Tesla employee who preferred to remain anonymous said that the boss sent him a mean-spirited email message when he missed a company-related event to attend the birth of his child.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am extremely disappointed,\u201d Musk allegedly wrote, saying that the birth of the child was no excuse to miss the event. \u201cYou need to figure out where your priorities are,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re changing the world and changing history, and you either commit or you don\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ouch, that\u2019s quite a scolding for what most people would consider one of the most sacred moments in life (the childbirth, not the meeting).<\/p>\n<p>Musk, however, took to Twitter recently to dispute the allegation, saying it was inaccurate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is total BS &amp; hurtful to claim that I told a guy to miss his child\u2019s birth just to attend a company meeting,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cI would never do that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What is without dispute is Musk\u2019s laser-focus on work. \u201cOne night, he told me, \u2018If there was a way that I could not eat, so I could work more, I would not eat,\u201d Christie Nicholson, the daughter of a Musk advisor quoted him as saying. \u201cI wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be surprised if Musk gets into the nutrition business next, Musk is a problem-solver who always seems to find a solution when he puts his mind to it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With entrepreneur extraordinaire Elon Musk\u2019s biography having just dropped, it seemed like a good opportunity to take a look back &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":1834,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72],"yst_prominent_words":[5094,2120,5099,5103,5093,3236,2170,5102,5101,5089,5095,5097,5091,5098,2277,5090,5096,3090,5092,5100],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How Did Elon Musk Do It?
