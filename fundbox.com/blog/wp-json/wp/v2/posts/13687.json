If you\u2019re considering changing or dissolving your business partnership by buying out another partner, try following these six steps for a smooth transition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Figure out what you want from a buyout<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you get started, it\u2019s helpful to consider <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019re interested in a buyout. Do you want to change the direction of the company, for example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exit a bad partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or gain more financial control?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding your own motivations and goals is the first step to determining your deal-breakers and assessing where you\u2019d be willing to compromise. From there, you can approach your business partner with more confidence and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Communicate your expectations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you and your business partner can reach a mutual understanding before lawyers get involved, the buyout will be much easier. Start off on the right foot by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">communicating with your partner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> early. Ask to have a conversation, then speak calmly and directly as you explain your position, goals, and expectations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be prepared to answer questions in a professional, respectful way\u2014including why you want to buy your partner out\u2014and get input from your business partner, too. It\u2019s also a good idea to document the conversation by taking notes. Having a record (however informal) of your points of discussion, areas of agreement, and potential concerns can serve as a starting point for negotiations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Consult a business attorney and accountant<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnership buyouts can become tricky\u2014not to mention contentious\u2014so it\u2019s crucial to bring in professionals like an attorney and accountant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A mergers and acquisitions lawyer will guide you through the entire buyout process, advising you on potential legal hurdles, helping you gather records, and working with you to create a fair buy and sell agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, on the other hand, will help you understand the buyout from a financial perspective. An accountant will go over your personal financials; the business\u2019s profits and losses, assets and liabilities, and cash flow; your equity stake; and the company\u2019s sales forecasts post-buyout.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Get an independent valuation of the business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring an independent valuation expert to assess your company is a good way to get objective information about your business\u2019s financial health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A valuation company will typically review your balance sheets, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow forecasts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and sales or revenue to assess your business\u2019s worth and determine its fair market value. Many valuation experts also consider a range of other factors that affect a company\u2019s monetary value, including but not limited to: the state of the market; your business partner\u2019s expertise, individual sale numbers, or creative contributions; and your business\u2019s competition.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get a thorough valuation, you can work on creating terms that benefit both you and your business partner.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Clarify the terms of your buy and sell agreement\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comprehensive buy and sell agreement is the basis of a successful partnership buyout. In addition to detailing the terms of ownership from a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial standpoint<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s also important to outline the non-financial consequences of a partnership buyout.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defining each partner\u2019s role, responsibilities, and involvement with the business post-buyout can help prevent lawsuits and complications down the road.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, for example, your partner is the lead salesperson at your company, are they going to continue working or leave? If they leave, how will you ensure they don\u2019t take their contacts with them? Your lawyer may need to draft a non-compete agreement for your partner to sign. Similarly, if your partner came up with the business logo and slogan, you may want to include a clause in the contract that addresses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trademarks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or intellectual property rights.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Research financing options<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your personal savings and your company finances, you may not have enough money to buy your partner\u2019s share of the business outright. If that\u2019s the case, here are some of your best options for funding a partnership buyout:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Get a bank loan. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks typically offer affordable interest rates; however, bank loans can be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">harder to qualify for<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a partnership buyout because you\u2019re not using the money for working capital or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-chances-of-getting-a-business-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Pay back your partner in installments with interest. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paying back your partner over time is a good option if you can\u2019t qualify for a loan, but it also means you have to maintain a professional relationship with your partner for years post-buyout.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Sell your partner\u2019s shares or interests to an outside investor.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Equity financing is a great way to gain access to sizable capital. Keep in mind, though: you\u2019d still end up sharing control over the company, since you\u2019d essentially be exchanging one partner for another.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying out your business partner is a big move, but you can set yourself up for success by weighing your options and consulting professionals along the way.
