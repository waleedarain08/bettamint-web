Due to the uncertainties that came with 2020, this maxim holds even more truth for 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you begin to make financial resolutions for the new year, it\u2019s important to strike a balance between short-term and long-term financial goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an example of a short-term financial goal?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Like the name suggests, a short-term financial goal is something you hope to achieve in the near future \u2014 say within six or 12 months tops.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you\u2019re one of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-long-companies-can-survive-without-bringing-in-money-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">50 percent of businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that only has a cash buffer that allows you to keep your doors open for 27 days, <\/span>you may want to establish an immediate short-term goal of increasing your cash reserves.<\/p>\n<p>That way, you\u2019d be better positioned to deal with some of the unforeseen disruptions many small businesses saw in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you set long-term financial goals?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-term financial goals, on the other hand, are goals you hope to achieve at some point down the road\u2014in five, 10, or 20 years, or even longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common long-term financial goals for small business owners is making sure you have enough money to retire comfortably. Unfortunately, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/03\/14\/heres-how-many-americans-are-not-saving-any-money-for-emergencies-or-retirement-at-all.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">21 percent of Americans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t put <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of their income aside for retirement planning, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/lifestyle\/survey-finds-42-americans-retire-100701878.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">64 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lack the funds they need to live comfortably in their golden years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a small business owner, you have more retirement options than the average professional. To this end, you might want to look into establishing an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-for-freelancers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEP IRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or a solo 401(k) program in 2021 to meet your long-term financial goal of retiring comfortably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that\u2014by making financial resolutions and sticking to them\u2014it\u2019s possible to achieve both your short-term and long-term financial goals. It might take some time and some sacrifice. But with patience and determination, it\u2019s possible to optimize your small business\u2019 cash situation and end up in a much stronger financial position before you know it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you begin planning for 2021, one thing to keep in mind is that\u2014while financial resolutions are great to make\u2014 they\u2019re also okay to break; lots of people tend to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ashiraprossack1\/2018\/12\/31\/goals-not-resolutions\/?sh=604182093879\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">break their resolutions anyway<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Still, simply spending the time coming up with resolutions is a worthwhile exercise that can start getting you thinking in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at four financial resolutions you should consider for your small business as we move into the new year. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Review and optimize your monthly budget\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2018\/11\/small-business-budget-statistics.html#:~:text=A%20new%20survey%20from%20Clutch,official%20documented%20budget%20for%202018.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61 percent of small businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> don\u2019t have any sort of documented budget.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re a one-person team and have good control over your finances, that might not matter much. But once your small business starts to scale, you should seriously consider setting a budget and tracking cash outflows each month. Not only will this give you more visibility into where your finances stand at any given time, it will also improve your cash flow and can help you identify areas where you could potentially find some savings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t improve your business\u2019 spending habits if you don\u2019t know what they are to begin with. By reviewing your spending each month, you can identify areas for optimization, get more control over your finances in a relatively short period of time, and measure your progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Pay down high-interest credit card debt<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there\u2019s such a thing as \u201cgood debt,\u201d high-interest business credit card debt definitely isn\u2019t it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet according to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paymentsjournal.com\/what-percent-of-smbs-carry-consistent-credit-card-debt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, nearly one out of every four small businesses carry a balance on their credit card each month. What\u2019s more, 50 percent say they carry a balance every now and again. If you\u2019re contributing to either of those figures, you should do whatever it takes to settle your balance in full as fast as you can. Otherwise, you\u2019re just burning money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only are credit card interest rates prohibitively high, you end up paying interest on interest when you only make minimum payments each month. Depending on how high your balance is, it can lead to a debt spiral that\u2019s incredibly hard to get out of in the best case scenario.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve paid off your business credit card debt, get into the habit of paying your balance off in full <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">each month<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Use credit cards for convenience and to take advantage of rewards points\u2014not to dig yourself into a massive hole of debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Secure flexible financing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a small business owner whose goal is ending up next year in a much healthier financial position, you should think about securing a flexible source of financing that gives you fast access to the cash you need to grow. It beats the alternative of racking up high-interest debt or running into cash flow problems and not knowing what to do next.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apply<\/a> for a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> online and borrow against it as needed, only paying interest on the money you draw. Remember, getting a business line of credit doesn\u2019t always require a long application process. Learn <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/#how-it-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to apply for a Fundbox line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two easy steps and, if approved, secure funding rapidly. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Invest in your future<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a resolution that combines short-term and long-term financial goals: investing more money in the future of your company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A short-term goal could be investing in new tools and technologies that enable you to increase productivity. For example, if you\u2019re still using spreadsheets or worse to manage your accounting, you might want to check out accounting solutions like Quickbooks, FreshBooks, or Xero. Not only will this give you more control over your finances, you\u2019ll also be able to reclaim time and reinvest it in other areas of operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, you may find that a simple investment like this gives you enough time to develop new products, target new customers, or create more persuasive marketing campaigns \u2014 all of which can help grow your bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are your financial resolutions for 2021?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some financial resolutions and sticking to them, it\u2019s that much easier for your small business to finish up next year in a more advantageous position than you began it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above list is by no means complete; there are hundreds upon hundreds of financial resolutions you can make for the upcoming year. Still, it should give you some ideas as a starting point.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s to making smart financial resolutions that enable you to help your business achieve its goals next year and beyond.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The beginning of a new year is as good a time as any to take a step back and figure &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":14819,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11532,426],"yst_prominent_words":[723,1136,1805,724,1804,978,1529,712],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"circle","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"4 Financial Resolutions for Small Business Owners in 2021 | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"The beginning of a new year is as good a time as any to take a step back and figure out what you can do to get your business\u2019 financial house in order.
