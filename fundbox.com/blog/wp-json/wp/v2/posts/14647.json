Business bank accounts can help you separate your personal and company finances, keep track of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/why-every-business-needs-cash-flow-forecasting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and manage business expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, not every bank is created equal. Certain banks are better for small businesses because of the resources and customer service they provide.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To figure out the best bank for your small business, set aside time to evaluate your needs first. Consider the following seven questions:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want in-person access to your bank, or do you prefer online and mobile banking?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s your business\u2019s monthly cash flow situation like?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will your business need <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/minority-entrepreneur-funding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the future?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want a business credit card?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What kinds of benefits are you looking for?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you comfortable paying monthly fees for certain services?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have familiarity with a certain bank already?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve thought about your business needs and preferences, it\u2019s time to do your homework. Here are six traits the best banks for small businesses have in common:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Multiple business banking account options<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good idea to look for a bank that offers a range of business bank accounts that cater to different needs. Ideally, you want a checking account that suits your company now, as well as one you could grow into as you scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider how many business checking account options a bank has, and the businesses they\u2019re designed for. Some business bank accounts are perfect for small companies with little banking activity, while others are built for larger businesses with rapidly changing cash flow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also have to evaluate the services each business account comes with. The most common Wells Fargo business account, for example, has Bill Pay and mobile deposit. The most popular Chase business account gives you multiple ways to send and receive payments, and the Bank of America small business accounts have enticing introductory offers for business owners.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end, the best small business checking account is the one that makes it easier to manage your business finances and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Online and mobile banking\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a business without online and mobile banking is almost impossible in today\u2019s virtual world. Having fast, intuitive online and mobile banking options saves you time and brainpower.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, most banks offer some version of online banking, but certain banks are ahead of the curve, designing their apps and online portals with speed, accessibility, and ease of use top of mind. Not only can you view your latest transactions in real time and send <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-accepting-mobile-payments-can-help-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in one click, you can also deposit checks on your phone and set up automated payments for recurring costs like rent and utilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t need in-person banking services, you may even want to consider a digital-only institution. Some of the best online banks offer lower monthly service fees, since they don\u2019t have a brick and mortar to maintain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Financing help\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t need financing any time soon, partnering with a bank that provides lending options can put you one step ahead in the future. As you shop for the right bank, think about your business\u2019s growth goals and potential financing needs. If you want to open a second location in the next 10 years, for example, a term loan could help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some banks partner with the Small Business Administration to offer a range of business loans and microloans. Other banks offer equipment financing, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/line-of-credit-stay-competitive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business lines of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and short-term loans. Most banks also have business credit cards, though the terms, fees, and rewards differ greatly. Certain cards come with steep annual fees, but others may have cash-back opportunities or zero-fee introductory offers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Operations assistance\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best banks don\u2019t just meet your business\u2019s financial needs\u2014they help facilitate other areas of your business, too. Think: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/simplify-small-business-payroll\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payroll<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and HR. While some banks only offer business checking and savings accounts, others provide payroll services, merchant services, HR assistance, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integrations with your business software for consistent accounting and reporting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the particular bank and business checking account you choose, you may have to pay a fee for these additional services, but the extra cost could be worth it. Having all your financial and operational reporting in one place makes it easy to track your company\u2019s cash flow and reconcile issues quickly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Fees that work for you<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every bank has different fees for its services and business banking accounts, but the cost of maintaining an account should feel\u2014at minimum\u2014reasonable considering the value you get.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review the following numbers when evaluating a bank:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monthly service fee for maintaining a business checking account<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average weekly or monthly balance needed to waive the fee<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of transactions allowed per month\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cash amount you\u2019re allowed to deposit per month\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What works for you depends on your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-resolutions-business-finances\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business\u2019s finances<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and day-to-day operations. If you have a large number of transactions each month and your cash flow is steady enough to maintain a high account balance, you may feel more comfortable paying a higher monthly service fee for a different business checking account. However, if you don\u2019t have a lot of banking activity, you may want to opt for a basic checking account with a smaller service fee.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Attentive customer service<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing a bank that cares about its customers and aligns with your values is key to building a healthy long-term working relationship. When assessing a bank\u2019s customer service, consider the following:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How easy is it to get in touch with a representative?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do bank employees take the time to answer your questions?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are people generally kind and helpful?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the onboarding process like?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How welcomed and valued do you feel as a customer?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are countless big and small ways banks show their appreciation for customers. Some offer new customers rewards or bonuses for opening an account, for example. Other banks have free resources for business owners, like networking events, mentorship opportunities, or grant programs for women or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/minority-entrepreneur-funding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minority small business owners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right bank for you<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right business bank account can help you facilitate customer payments, manage your cash flow more easily, and streamline tedious backend processes. To choose the best bank for you, make sure you factor in your business\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financing needs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, day-to-day cash flow, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goals.
