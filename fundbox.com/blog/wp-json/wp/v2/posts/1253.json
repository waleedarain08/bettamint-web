Let\u2019s face it, most of the time you probably don\u2019t know where the next gig is coming from and would gladly jump at the chance of new\/more work.<\/p>\n<p>But what can you do when it feels like you\u2019re drinking from the fire hose and can\u2019t take on any more work?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips for turning down new and existing clients, without compromising the relationship you\u2019ve worked so hard to establish.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Turning down new clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is a tricky one, no one wants to turn away net new business, but taking on new work when you know you can\u2019t give it your full attention or complete it to your usual standards could be a killer for your business.<\/p>\n<p>The best approach is to <strong>be honest<\/strong>. If you really are interested in the work and think the client is a good fit, explain that at this point in time your bandwidth is limited (this will show that you are good at what you do and in high demand). <strong>Be clear about when you foresee any openings in your schedule<\/strong> and see if the client can wait. If not, propose taking on a smaller project on their behalf so that they can make a dent in their to-do list, and you have the opportunity to prove your value.<\/p>\n<p>Often, during these initial discussions, new clients are simply trying to gauge what you can do for them and are willing to wait. Those that expect you to drop everything for them are probably not the kind of clients you want anyway.<\/p>\n<p>If they push hard <strong>don\u2019t be shy about offering a referral<\/strong> \u2013 this shows that you are willing to help, have a problem-solving attitude, and you\u2019ll likely be remembered.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Saying no to existing clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Great clients will always ask about your availability. If your schedule is fully booked for the next few weeks, be upfront about this: \u201c<em>My schedule is booked for the next two weeks<\/em>\u201d, and then offer a solution: \u201c<em>If the project can wait, I can definitely help out at a later date.<\/em>\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If this kind of gentle pushback doesn\u2019t work, go with your gut. Is the client known for being difficult to work with? Do they often give you projects that change scope halfway through? Will taking on the extra work compromise your ability to take care of what\u2019s already on your plate?<\/p>\n<p>Saying no to regular clients tends to be easier, because they already appreciate the value of your work, and quite frankly, know that finding that elsewhere is going to be hard.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Trust your gut<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re probably seeing a trend here. Freelancers live and breathe by what their gut tells them. If you ever get the feeling that something isn\u2019t quite as it should be, or the client is pushing you too hard, don\u2019t touch it, even if it means turning away a multi-thousand dollar contract. If you\u2019ve been in the business for long enough, you\u2019ll come to realize that your gut instinct is rarely wrong.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The bottom line<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Knowing when to turn a client down is a delicate balancing act that gets easier with experience. Weigh up the value of the job against what you\u2019ve already got going on. How much will it bring in? Will it compromise your ability to meet deadlines elsewhere? How do you cope with stress? Can you afford to give up a few evenings and weekends to get the work done?<\/p>\n<p>Turning someone down is the easy part, it\u2019s getting to the point where you\u2019re confident with your decision that takes experience and a little gut instinct.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re self-employed or a freelancer, the very thought of having turning clients away might seem like an unimaginable circumstance. &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":12547,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11547],"yst_prominent_words":[4597,723,1248,773,4602,4596,4598,4098,4137,4135,3499,1542,2336,3455,4601,3300,4599,2074,4600,3090],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Turn Down Freelance Work Properly and Profitably","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Here are a few tips for turning down freelance work, without compromising the relationship you\u2019ve worked so hard to establish."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"How to Turn Down Freelance Work Properly and Profitably"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Here are a few tips for turning down freelance work, without compromising the relationship you\u2019ve worked so hard to establish."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/turn-down-freelance-work-properly\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/femaleartist.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/femaleartist.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"668"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Here are a few tips for turning down freelance work, without compromising the relationship you\u2019ve worked so hard to establish."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"How to Turn Down Freelance Work Properly and Profitably"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/femaleartist.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/turn-down-freelance-work-properly\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1253"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1253"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1253\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12548,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1253\/revisions\/12548"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/12547"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1253"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1253"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1253"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=1253"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
