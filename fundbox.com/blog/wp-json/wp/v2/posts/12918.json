Yet #paytoday partner Alignable estimates that 37% have 1 month or less of cash. With shelter-in-place rules in place across the U.S., many small businesses have lost significant revenue and are living off of those minimal cash reserves. For many, the situation is dire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#paytoday argues that, if everyone paid their small business vendors right away, there would be almost a trillion dollars injected into the economy, straight to small businesses. That could be enough runway to help them survive until the federal government\u2019s stimulus package is disbursed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox has committed to paying our small business vendors ahead of all others. Fundbox CFO Marten Abrahamsen said, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a short term relief effort it\u2019s vital that we get money into the hands of our SMB suppliers quickly. This said, we are prioritizing and committing to pay our small business suppliers first.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Alignable and Fundbox, the other coalition members include Gusto, Business.com, Womply, Small Business Edge, smallbizdaily, and the Actual Agency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please support this initiative by using the <strong>#paytoday hashtag<\/strong>, and visiting <\/span><strong>paytoday.club<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can learn more, sign the pledge, and
