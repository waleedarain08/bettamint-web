That means they&#8217;ll be privy to the fact that your small business is short on cash. That&#8217;s probably not the best look for a business that&#8217;s trying to grow.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> It&#8217;s restrictive<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you work with an invoice factoring company, you give up at least a little control over your small business\u2014particularly if you&#8217;re forced to sign a contract. For example, the factoring company may determine some of your customers aren&#8217;t creditworthy enough for you to continue doing business with them. Do you really want someone telling you how to run your company?<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><strong> It&#8217;s limiting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Because invoice factoring companies only allow you to sell your existing invoices, invoice factoring is limiting. You can&#8217;t get more money than the fraction of your invoices the company will pay. Invoice factoring companies absorb a huge chunk of your receivables, so you&#8217;re probably better off looking elsewhere for help.<\/p>\n<p>Invoice factoring isn&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be, but the good news is you can use an invoice financing service like <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=4-reasons-invoice-factoring-is-overrated\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> to solve your cash flow problems.
