In this installment of our tax expert series, Haugo and Whitehouse explain how small businesses can get more from their tax and financial advisors.<\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8276\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8276\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8276\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jan-Haugo_headshot.jpg\" alt=\"Jan Haugo\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jan Haugo, President, JH &amp; Associates<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td>\n<td>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_8277\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8277\" style=\"width: 200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8277\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Geni-Whitehouse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8277\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Geni Whitehouse, CPA, Speaker &amp; Instructor<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Most small businesses are being underserved by their accountant, insists Geni Whitehouse, consultant, author, and one of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpapracticeadvisor.com\/note\/12380697\/geni-whitehouse-cpacitp-2017-most-powerful-women-in-accounting-honoree\">Most Powerful Women in Accounting<\/a><\/span>\u00a0according to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CPA Practice Advisor<\/span>. But it\u2019s not the accountants\u2019 fault, she says. They simply aren\u2019t being asked to utilize all of the tools in their proverbial belt.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAccountants have skills that aren\u2019t being leveraged,\u201d Whitehouse explains. \u201cThey are seen as once-a-year resources, as auditors for annual reporting. They really should be utilized year-round.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s up to small business owners to ask for additional help, she says, and accountants should be tapped on a monthly basis or when big financial decisions or purchases need to be made.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTax specialists are typically used for reporting, which is purely historical in nature,\u201d confirms Jan Haugo, accountant, small business owner, and former CEO of the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers in the United States. \u201cThey should be used for strategy and decision making, which is forward thinking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Accountants can help anticipate and calculate what\u2019s coming, she explains, like tax payments and cash needs. And they can often make recommendations in the present that will minimize a small business\u2019 future tax liability, maximize its financial maneuverability, or both.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe right\u00a0accountant\u00a0is\u00a0a resource for not just annual reporting, but also education, strategy, and advice,\u201d Whitehouse says. \u201cThey can help a small business transition from reactive to proactive.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Being reactive\u2014making financial decisions and investments throughout the year without financial and tax guidance, for example\u2014can come at the expense of possible tax relief or cash savings, she notes. This is especially true for companies that sell products, build things, operate in multiple states, or have employees.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Beyond advice: Tools and services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While some small business owners hand all of their financial documents and receipts to their accountant and others try to do it all themselves using platforms like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\">Quickbooks<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">Freshbooks<\/a><\/span>, both Whitehouse and Haugo recommend a combination of professional guidance and tools.<\/p>\n<p>Haugo is a proponent of cloud-based accounting software, which gives her a permission-dependent window into her clients\u2019 financials. This visibility allows her to proactively monitor her clients\u2019 workflows, cash reserves, and potential tax liabilities and give advice throughout the year\u2014instead of waiting for tax season, when such advice may no longer be applicable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo make the best recommendations, I need to be informed throughout the year,\u201d Haugo says. \u201cCloud-based tools are invaluable because they provide visibility and stimulate dialogue. But it\u2019s important to remember that this is a process. Don\u2019t be in a rush.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Accountants and financial advisors can also recommend services that are geared toward small business needs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSmall business owners need to be proactive about stating their financial goals and asking for help,\u201d Whitehouse says. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as, \u2018Here is what I\u2019m looking to achieve. Can you help me, and if not, can you point me in the right direction?\u2019<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAccountants can and should be\u00a0a resource for additional services and providers,\u201d she continues.\u00a0\u201cFundbox is a perfect example. It\u2019s a fantastic solution for when payroll is due but the check is still in the mail, and it\u2019s something accountants should be telling their clients about.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It all starts with a persistent and trusted relationship that features open dialogue and lots of questions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">INFOGRAPHIC: 3 things to consider when choosing an accountant<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8979\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/3-things-when-choosing-accountant-infographic.png\" alt=\"Infographic: 3 things to consider when choosing an accountant\" width=\"600\" height=\"944\" \/><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>About Geni Whitehouse<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Geni Whitehouse, CPA, divides her time between working as a winery consultant at Brotemarkle, Davis &amp; Co in the Napa Valley and writing, speaking, tweeting, and posting at <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evenanerd.com\/\">EvenANerd.com<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.
