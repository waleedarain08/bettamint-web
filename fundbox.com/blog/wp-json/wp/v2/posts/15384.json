The period for filing federal tax returns was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/2021-tax-filing-season-begins-feb-12-irs-outlines-steps-to-speed-refunds-during-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delayed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to February 12, 2021 to allow the IRS to test its systems following pandemic-related changes to tax law. Argh, pressure! But wait. In March, the IRS announced it was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">extending Tax Day for individuals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (including those who pay self-employment tax) to May 17, 2021. Phew!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, questions still abound about stimulus checks, PPP loan forgiveness, when refunds will be issued, and more. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you prepare your small business tax return, we answer your pressing 2020 tax season questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is the last date for filing your 2020 tax return?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated above, you must file your 2020 taxes by May 17, 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, even with this extended deadline, it\u2019s wise to file your federal income tax return as soon as possible, especially if you\u2019re owed a refund. Most refunds are issued within 21 days if you file electronically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need additional time, you can request a filing extension until October 15, 2021 by filing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-4868\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 4868<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (although this does not grant an extension of the time you have to pay any due taxes).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the filing extension only applies to federal returns. You are still required to file your state tax return on time. This is a fluid situation, so check with your state to see if they plan to extend their filing deadlines too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How can I calculate my tax refund?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t prepared your taxes yet, most tax filing companies offer a tax return calculator. There\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tools\/calculators\/taxcaster\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TaxCaster<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from TurboTax, H&amp;R Block\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrblock.com\/tax-calculator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income Tax Calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, NerdWallet\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/taxes\/tax-calculator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federal Income Tax Calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and more. You don\u2019t need to subscribe to their tax service to use each of these tools, just enter a few details about your income, expenses, and so on for an estimate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Where\u2019s my refund?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you qualify for a refund for taxes paid in 2020 you can track your IRS refund status via the IRS\u2019 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/refunds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where\u2019s My Refund?<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool. This information is typically available 24-48 hours after the IRS accepted your electronic filing. Enter your Social Security number or ITIN, filing status, and exact refund amount for an update. Refunds are usually approved in about two business days and refunds issued approximately 20 days later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When will I get a stimulus check?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stimulus checks are un-related to your tax refund, but if you are eligible for the third round of payments under the $1.9 trillion relief package you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">track the status of your stimulus payment with the IRS<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Payments will be based on your 2019 federal tax return. You should be able to check your eligibility, payment status, and whether you\u2019ll receive it electronically or in the mail.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>I received a PPP loan, how does that impact my tax return?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan under pandemic-response legislation in 2020 to keep workers on payroll during the pandemic, it\u2019s important to understand whether you owe taxes on your loan. Here\u2019s what you need to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>PPP loan forgiveness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPP loans may be forgiven<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, meaning they are essentially grants, but only if at least 60% of the loan was spent on paying employees a normal salary for 8-24 weeks after the loan was approved. The remaining 40% could be spent on expenses such as mortgage interest, rent, operating costs, and more (although they can\u2019t be used to pay business taxes).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>How to apply for PPP loan forgiveness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: To get forgiveness, businesses must complete a PPP Loan Forgiveness Application and file it with their lender. Employers may also be eligible for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">partial<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> forgiveness, for instance if salaries decreased slightly or the number of full-time employees on payroll declined somewhat.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>PPP loans and your taxes<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Importantly, if a PPP loan is forgiven it is not considered taxable income and is tax-exempt. Furthermore, any expenses paid for using the loan can also be written off as regular business expenses in your tax return.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you better understand the tax implications associated with PPP loans, read: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does a PPP Loan Affect Your Taxes?<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, if you\u2019re looking for extra funds for your business and are curious about PPP loans, know that sole proprietors and independent contractors now qualify. Yes, indeed. Don\u2019t let the \u201cpaycheck\u201d in the name fool you into thinking you wouldn\u2019t qualify for this\u00a0forgivable loan. In fact, since you don\u2019t have staff headcount, payroll, and benefits to calculate, your application process (for the loan and later for forgiveness) should be much simpler. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about how much you can borrow, what you can spend your PPP loan on, and what you\u2019ll need to apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is it too late to file 2019 taxes?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deadline for filing 2019 taxes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was July 15, 2020 (postponed from April 15 due to the pandemic). Automatic extensions were available through October 15, 2020 for those unable to file by the earlier deadline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/coronavirus\/get-my-payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the IRS has yet to process than 2.4 million individual income tax returns for 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
