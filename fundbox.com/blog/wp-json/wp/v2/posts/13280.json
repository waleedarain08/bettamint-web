When and how you reopen your business depends on your location and industry, but you may want to consider to begin planning to ensure you\u2019re complying with safety rules and adequately addressing customer concerns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eager to get back in business? Follow these seven steps to create a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/co\/reopening\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reopening plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Reevaluate business operations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by revisiting your business model to determine whether or not your current operation will be viable in a post-coronavirus world. Ask yourself these five questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would it look like to reopen business under the current restrictions?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will our staffing needs be going forward? Can employees work remotely?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are we still able to get what we need from suppliers?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do customers want right now? How can we deliver?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s possible for your business depends on your offerings, industry, location, cash flow, and customer demand. You may need to adjust your business model or rewrite your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/why-consider-quarterly-planning-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to satisfy customers and comply with new regulations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a restaurant, for example, you may have to change your seating layout or open an express window for deliveries or pick-up orders. If you own a dental practice, you may be forced to eliminate the standard waiting room or cut down on the number of front-desk employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reimagining the possibilities for your business is pivotal to creating a workable plan for reopening.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Prioritize health and safety\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The health and safety of your employees and customers should be your number one goal when reopening. That starts with abiding by <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/community\/reopen-guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDC guidelines<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and local regulations for sanitation and safety, said Ryan Reiffert, a business attorney and the owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ryanreiffert.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Law Offices of Ryan Reiffert<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a boutique business and corporate law firm in San Antonio, Texas. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf they mandate signs, put up signs; if they mandate face masks, wear face masks.\u201d Ignoring these regulations can put your business at risk of legal trouble, he added.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it\u2019s important to think of your state, county, and local rules as just the starting point for safety measures, Reiffert said; taking additional precautions \u2014 like installing plexiglass breathing barriers, using air purifiers, or rearranging your store or office layout to accommodate six feet of distance \u2014 is critical.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Create a training and communication plan for employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/management-during-coronavirus\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are up-to-date on new policies and regulations before reopening. Work with your HR director and business attorney to create a guide that details new safety and sanitation procedures, changes in job duties or customer service tactics, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfib.com\/assets\/NFIB-Webinar-04-29-20-FINAL.pdf?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">updated policies around sick leave<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, healthcare, and working from home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to set aside time to talk with employees prior to reopening, said Jessica Lambrecht, the founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.therisejourney.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Rise Journey<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a company that advises businesses on organizational strategy. Make sure you go over new policies in detail, walk employees through workplace safety measures, and share protocol for reporting issues or discussing concerns, she added.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication should be ongoing. Consider establishing weekly online meetings, scheduling one-on-one meetings with managers, and planning for organization-wide email updates, Lambrecht said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining a clear line of communication before and after your business reopens will help mitigate employee fears and keep operations running smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Figure out how to meet customers needs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The way you treat your customers can play a big role in your business\u2019s success upon reopening. \u201cBusinesses need to focus on customer retention, and how to make their members feel comfortable again,\u201d said Lucas Aylward, the CEO and owner of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skysoarmarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SkySoar Marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by identifying your customers\u2019 concerns, he suggested. Many people are worried about increased exposure to the virus once businesses reopen, while others are concerned about not having full access to the services and products they typically rely on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe goal with a retention plan is to identify \u2018How are we going to retain our customers and keep them happy?\u2019\u201d said Aylward. Consider reaching out to your customers with a phone call, email survey, or social media post to gauge their worries and needs moving forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Say, for example, that your e-commerce team no longer has the manpower to prepare online orders in two business days. You could help customers feel comfortable with a longer shipping timeline by offering a discount on shipping above a certain dollar amount, including a bonus gift with each package, or simply using more compassionate language in your email updates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other smart retention steps include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/improving-business-while-closed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">boosting your social media presence<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, creating blog posts or videos with valuable content, and finding ways to improve customer service, Aylward said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Review your finances\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding your business\u2019s finances can help you develop an effective reopening plan. \u201cYou simply can\u2019t thrive in an economic downturn if you aren\u2019t obsessive in your knowledge of your revenue, expenses, profit, and cash flow numbers,\u201d said Wayne Richard, a partner and Director of Global Operations at Bean Ninjas, an online business bookkeeping service with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1590857232687000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcyN72RRbq_qYn9hmo9wTfA0HNSg\">Xero<\/a>, a cloud accounting software provider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work with your accountant to update your financial plan with adjusted revenue goals and a new debt repayment timeline for the rest of 2020. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to reviewing your current <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and monthly expenses, consider compiling a list of reopening costs, including buying sanitation and safety supplies, increasing marketing efforts, and consulting a lawyer on potential coronavirus-related issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, create a few different cash flow forecasts, Richard said: one for the best-case scenario, one that\u2019s more moderate, and one that represents the worst-case scenario. These forecasts can help you set sales targets and figure out where to cut costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you have numerous cash flow forecasts scenarios planned out, you\u2019ll be able to make decisions based on logic and data instead of relying solely on intuition and emotion.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Rethink your marketing plan\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is more important than ever in the wake of the coronavirus, Aylward said. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFoot traffic will be dramatically decreased because of COVID-19, so paid traffic will need to make up for that.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider how you can refine your marketing strategy to connect to past customers <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i> <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract new ones<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You may need to be more active on social media, invest in strategic email nurture campaigns, partner with influencers or bloggers, or embrace content marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond increasing your distribution channels to reach a wider customer base, consider adjusting your messaging and communication methods, too. You may want to develop a communication plan that outlines your updated value proposition and brand tone, as well as details on how you\u2019ll inform customers about your reopening and any changes to the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Prepare to adapt<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying up-to-date on changing business regulations post-virus may be difficult, but it\u2019s essential. \u201cThis is a moving target, and someone is going to have to do the work of staying informed, whether it&#8217;s you, your office manager, or your attorney,\u201d said Reiffert.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay attention to the news, local and industry-wide announcements, and your customers\u2019 attitudes. \u201cMany cities have put up centralized web pages that have the most recent developments. Check that website on a weekly, if not daily, basis,\u201d Reiffert said. Consider reaching out to your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.officialusa.com\/stateguides\/chambers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local chamber of commerce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the SBA for guidance and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/page\/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resources<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he added.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic is an ever-shifting situation, so it\u2019s a good idea to work with an attorney and accountant to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-disaster-prep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create contingency plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in case of increased restrictions or future closures. \u201cBe ready for potential walking-back of some of these reopening measures,\u201d Reiffert said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is also a good time to look to your fellow business owners for guidance and inspiration, Aylward said. \u201cCOVID-19 has thrown everyone for a loop, and we&#8217;re all learning along the way.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re able to reopen your business next week or next quarter, creating a plan can help you weather the difficult times and prepare for increased demand.
