This convenience is a double-edged sword. By enabling higher-volume sales, trade credit helps small companies compete, but it inhibits their growth in many ways. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they don&#8217;t get paid right away, small businesses mentioned in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/ebooks\/frost-sullivan-the-future-of-b2b-commerce\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frost &amp; Sullivan study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> said they often face cash flow problems and other risks associated with trade credit \u2014 a process that essentially requires their accounts receivables staff to act like financing and collections departments.
