That\u2019s a high percentage, so that\u2019s not a number that\u2019s high-credit-score friendly.<\/p>\n<p>Although different credit bureaus factor your credit utilization ratio into their score algorithm differently, the bottom line is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/collection-post\/2791957\/what-is-my-credit-score\/\">that the ratio affects your credit score number<\/a><\/span>. Ideally, you\u2019d like to keep your ratio below 30%. If you need to lower your credit utilization in order to get a higher score to apply for business financing, for instance, there are some strategies you can take advantage of to get that number down.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve written before on strategies for improving your credit, but in this article, we&#8217;ll focus on credit utilization in particular. Here are five ways to lower your credit utilization ratio.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Schedule credit payments more often.<\/h2>\n<p>Considering your credit utilization ratio is just that\u2014a ratio\u2014it\u2019s up to you to bring that number down. If you are able, consider paying off your outstanding debts, such as business credit card bills, more than once a month.<\/p>\n<p>If at all possible, you should already have your bills on autopay so you never miss a payment. For the months when your spending is higher than usual, nip that total in the bud so you\u2019re not carrying such a high balance the entire month.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Transfer balances to 0% APR credit cards.<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re carrying a balance on your <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-ways-business-credit-card-can-help-improve-credit\/\">business credit cards<\/a>, your interest means more money. That interest adds up, driving up your credit utilization ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This actually harms you two ways. Not only does your balance end up costing you cash, but it also might end up costing you a higher credit score. In that case, consider applying for a<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-credit-cards\/0-apr\">\u00a00% intro APR business credit card<\/a><\/span>, many of which will allow you to transfer your balance. These cards have an interest-free introductory period, which means you can carry a balance on your card without paying anything extra for a predetermined period.<\/p>\n<p>By transferring some or all of your balances to a new card, you can lower your overall average credit utilization across cards.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Keep your cards open.<\/h2>\n<p>Not using a credit card? Consider keeping it open anyway. It could actually help your credit utilization ratio.<\/p>\n<p>The available credit line on all of the credit cards in your name comprises the total amount of credit you have to available to use. If you close a card, that total amount goes down. That means even if you don\u2019t change your spending, your ratio goes up (which is the thing you will want to avoid).<\/p>\n<p>Before you think about trying to reverse engineer this concept by applying for another card to increase your available credit, remember that any time you apply for any line of credit, your credit score gets a temporary ding because of the hard credit inquiry. This is also called a \u201chard pull\u201d of your credit. Too many hard pulls can lower your credit score, and if you get rejected, this could also bring your score down.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Know when your lenders report to the credit bureaus.<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll have to make big purchases here and there. And it\u2019s great that you have a credit card to do this! If you are spending a lot, having a sense of when your lenders report to the credit bureaus (<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">generally once a month<\/span>) will enable you to be strategic.<\/p>\n<p>With this date, you can schedule payments before they report, or not make those big purchases right before your score is reported. Both of these can lower the ratio that your credit bureaus receive. You can simply ask your creditors to find out the date.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Get a better handle on your spending.<\/h2>\n<p>In general, the smartest thing you can do to lower your credit utilization ratio is to really have a sense of the details of your financial life. Knowing when your lenders report is one piece, but the other is simply understanding what your credit limit is and knowing how close you are to it with each purchase you make. The best thing about this piece of your credit score is that you have control over it. Part of getting down this number is staying in the loop with your spending and your payments.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>As a business owner (and an individual, too) there\u2019s a lot you can do with a higher credit score: Get a more favorable business loan, get approved for business credit cards that better benefit your business, get a mortgage, and have the leverage to negotiate on things like overdue payments. It\u2019s important to do the work to improve your credit utilization ratio if you know it\u2019s a place that you can do better. In most cases, it\u2019s possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your credit utilization ratio is an extremely important part of your credit score. \u00a0This tells lenders\u2014or anyone else looking at &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":19,"featured_media":10351,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11547],"yst_prominent_words":[10132,1721,1136,1135,10128,724,789,1142,3060,10121,10130,10125,10127,10124,10123,3046,10129,10126,10131,10122],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-right-curve","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"5 Ways to Lower Your Credit Utilization Ratio | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Your credit utilization ratio is an extremely important part of your credit score. \u00a0This tells lenders\u2014or anyone else looking at your credit score\u2014what percentage of your total available credit line you\u2019ve used at any given moment.
