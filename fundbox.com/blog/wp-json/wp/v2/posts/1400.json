Setting fees is a tricky business and we\u2019re often our own worst enemy when it comes to understanding the value we bring to our clients and setting our pricing accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of freelancers are paid by the hour and it\u2019s a methodology you need to try and put behind you. Why? It\u2019s not sustainable \u2013 there are only so many hours in the day, how can you ever grow your bottom line if your price is fixed and dictated by time constraints?<\/p>\n<p>But why is pricing your services as a freelance or consultant so tricky? Here are a few reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No one else does exactly what you do for whom you do it.<\/strong> You\u2019re not selling a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas; there\u2019s no benchmark metric that dictates what your price should be (based on your niche, skill, experience, and value).<\/li>\n<li><strong>You\u2019re not trained to sell yourself or price your services<\/strong>. Perhaps you\u2019ve come from an employed role and are now out on your own \u2013 all of a sudden you need to master new business skills, including pricing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fear of famine<\/strong> \u2013 Last, but by no means least, you\u2019re terrified of losing existing or new work, so you underprice yourself.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s take a look at four things you can do to become more pricing proficient and stop underpricing your services:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Understand Your Value to Your Clients<\/strong><br \/>\nDo you ever get the sense that your clients have locked you in as being worth a certain amount? If you price by the hour, then there\u2019s a good chance that they do.<\/p>\n<p>A better approach is to think about what you do in terms of the value delivered. Your value is the \u201cso what\u201d of what you do. It could be solution that has a direct impact on your client\u2019s bottom line or a task-based service that frees them up to focus on their priorities.<\/p>\n<p>The best cure for underpricing is not an indiscriminate rate hike; instead think about the problems you solve and the impact you bring.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you provide accounting services, you probably do a lot more than just keeping your client\u2019s books in order. Perhaps you help them avoid cash flow issues, steer clear of tax audits, understand when the right time to make big purchases is, and so on. As such, you\u2019re far more than a task-based CPA, you\u2019re a trusted advisor who saves them time and money. That\u2019s it right there; that\u2019s your value. That\u2019s what they pay for and may be willing to pay a little more for.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another example. A writer is commissioned to write a data sheet, but the writer isn\u2019t just producing a piece of collateral, they are creating something that the client didn\u2019t have time to do. They\u2019re equipping their client\u2019s sales force with tools that will help them sell more. And, if they know the industry well, the writer is probably going to turn that work around with a high degree of accuracy and speed.<\/p>\n<p>The point is, what you do is far more valuable to your clients than the time you spend doing it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Be Flexible in Your Value Pricing<\/strong><br \/>\nAs you think about what your value-based price will be, don\u2019t just come up with a \u201cone rate fits all\u201d pricing policy. One client may happily pay $500 for what only takes you three hours while another client may only be willing to pay $250 for the same project. It all depends on the value you\u2019re bringing to them at that point in time. For example, if a new client comes to you asking for help with their tax return two days before the filing deadline, you can bet your bottom dollar they\u2019ll be willing to pay more for your service!<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Build Your Brand Perception<\/strong><br \/>\nA great way to avoid underpricing yourself and introduce value-based pricing into your business is to focus on building your brand around what you do well and how your clients perceive you (note my point above about being perceived as an industry expert). Try to take on clients who recognize your value and grow your network from there. By positioning yourself as something more than just another freelancer for hire, you\u2019ll be able to position yourself much higher on the pricing totem pole.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. In Most Cases, Clients Will Buy It!<\/strong><br \/>\nUnless you\u2019re deluding yourself, most clients will be willing to pay more the value you bring \u2013 just as you\u2019d happily pay more for a nice meal that no other restaurant in your neighborhood can deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Finding someone else to do what you do is a cost in itself. If they see that value too, then it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll throw in the towel on the relationship now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><br \/>\nFreelancing as a career is finally gaining the respect it deserves and the potential for earning is increasing. Keep telling yourself that low prices don\u2019t always hold value in the freelance world \u2013 the client gets what they pay for. They know that, make sure you know that too!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you think about making more money out of your freelance business, getting new clients probably springs to mind, but &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":1447,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[723,1248,773,3500,4773,3037,3499,3235,3040,3384,4116,1784,1097,3300,4775,2074,4774,4772,4776],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Avoid Underpricing Your Freelance Services","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"When you think about making more money out of your freelance business, getting new clients probably springs to mind, but another often overlooked strategy is to increase your rates.
