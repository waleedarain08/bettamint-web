You go online, of course. Heck, today we go online before we go out to lunch. In fact a survey taken last year by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BrightLocal<\/a> shows <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/88-consumers-trust-online-reviews-much-personal-recommendations-195803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">88 percent of consumers trust online reviews<\/a> as much as recommendations from people they actually know.<\/p>\n<p>So of course, you know potential customers are checking out your company before they\u2019ll do business with you. If you\u2019re looking for investment capital or a loan, you can bet they\u2019re checking your online profile out as well. Obviously, it\u2019s imperative for you to manage your online reputation.<\/p>\n<p>But how? The sheer number of social networks, opinionated bloggers and review and rating websites that make it easy for consumers to praise\u2014or bash a business, make it hard to keep track of what people are saying and writing about your company.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there are several ways to stay on top of what\u2019s being said about your business. The most basic way is to set up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/alerts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Alert<\/a>. Create an alert on your name, your business name, and the products you make or sell, and Google scours the web for mentions and sends you an email as often as you like when these names are mentioned. You can also set up an alert for your industry to keep up on trends; if you want to keep tabs on your competition, set up alerts for their business\u2019s name as well.<\/p>\n<p>But in today\u2019s information-centric world, Google Alerts are likely not enough. There are a number of companies that monitor your online reputation. Here are a few sites to look at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmention.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Mention<\/a> searches user-generated content such as blogs, comments, bookmarks, events, news, videos and more.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/rankur.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rankur<\/a>, which offers tools for\u00a0online reputation management, social media listening and news clipping<\/li>\n<li>Viralheat, which provides social monitoring, analytics and content marketing in one intuitive interface<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.48ers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">48ers<\/a>, which searches multiple social media sites at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are plenty of other social monitoring tools. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalinformationworld.com\/2015\/03\/the-20-best-social-media-monitoring-tools-infographic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Information World<\/a> posted a useful infographic listing more than 20 social media monitoring tools that\u2019s well worth checking out.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t afford to ignore what\u2019s being said about you on review and ratings sites, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/search?find_desc=&amp;find_loc=san+francisco&amp;ns=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yelp<\/a>. It\u2019s smart to respond to what customers are posting there, the good and the bad. Reply with a \u201cthank you\u201d to the positive posters and with an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a bad experience\u201d to the negative ones. The key is not to get involved in an online battle with unsatisfied customers and answer them with facts and not emotions. Be respectful and ask what you can do to make it right and then take the conversation offline. Every business is going to have its naysayers, so don\u2019t take the bad reviews personally. And if you see a lot of similar complaints, treat them as free market research and remedy whatever is bothering your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Providing excellent customer service is more important than ever, since one customer\u2019s bad experience can go viral very quickly. Make sure your customers can easily contact you with problems or complaints, so they don\u2019t need to take it online to get a response from you. Make sure your email address and phone number are easy to find on your website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s the first thing you do when you want to learn about a new client, find out about a new &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":3153,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,10158],"yst_prominent_words":[5221,5220,723,5224,798,4858,807,5222,5218,5110,3522,870,4104,5223,3598,4937,804,794,5219,3075],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Protecting Your Online Reputation","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"In fact a survey taken last year by BrightLocal shows 88 percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as recommendations from people they actually know."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"Protecting Your Online Reputation"},{"property":"og:description","content":"In fact a survey taken last year by BrightLocal shows 88 percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as recommendations from people they actually know."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/protecting-your-online-reputation\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_325903628.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_325903628.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"1000"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"667"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"In fact a survey taken last year by BrightLocal shows 88 percent of consumers trust online reviews as much as recommendations from people they actually know."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"Protecting Your Online Reputation"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/shutterstock_325903628.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/protecting-your-online-reputation\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1898"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1898"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1898\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14340,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1898\/revisions\/14340"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3153"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1898"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1898"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1898"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=1898"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
