Two weeks later, the banks collapsed. A month after that, our largest clients went bankrupt. 2009 was an interesting year. 2010 was a year to rebuild.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since then, the Mattox Group has grown steadily. Business really picked up after a turning point three years ago, when Fagan decided, in his words, to \u201cget serious about turning it from a job into a business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After his years in the army, he wasn\u2019t interested in a typical job working for someone else: \u201cThe normal nine-to-five routine wasn\u2019t appealing to me. Now, 10 years later, I still don\u2019t like it! I started my business to have control over what I wanted to do in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The normal nine-to-five routine wasn\u2019t appealing to me. &#8230;I started my business to have control over what I wanted to do in the world.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>His vision and hard work have begun to pay off in the form of steady clients and financial success. \u201cThis year,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at close out the year with about half a million in gross revenue, and next year we have recurrent contracts already signed for close to three-quarters before we even start the year.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Key post-recession lessons<\/h2>\n<p>Coming out of a major recession successfully taught Fagan a few important things about growing a business, as well as surviving economic downturns.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest takeaways, he says, is that business is not always as expensive as he once thought, especially when it comes to hiring help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly, business is costly,\u201d Fagan clarifies, \u201cbut I\u2019d had an irrational fear that employees would be a drain rather than a value-add. Changing that [mindset] was a big shift. My second daily concern was that my employees wouldn\u2019t do things the way I had built my reputation to do them, they wouldn\u2019t be a part of our culture and the way we work with our clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He overcame these fears with the help of his business mentors, and his study of servant-based leadership. \u201cServant leadership\u201d is a concept coined by the businessman and author <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenleaf.org\/\">Robert K. Greenleaf<\/a><\/span>, built on the idea that a leader\u2019s most important job is to serve\u00a0others. Considering this concept led Fagan to start developing a more mission-driven culture at work, and changed his attitudes about recruiting.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10259\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10259\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10259\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/TMG-Fagen-team-photo.jpg\" alt=\"J.

Alan Fagan, founder and CEO of The Mattox Group, with his team members.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cI learned about developing that culture beyond just yourself,\u201d he explains. \u201cI started recruiting talent to fill, not just job requirements, but to fill roles and skills that we needed but didn\u2019t have in the company yet. With that came more than enough revenue to cover them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The second big takeaway that Fagan got from his early years in business was the need to be \u201crecession proof.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the lessons we learned during the recession,\u201d he says, \u201cwe now try to be recession-proof and not box ourselves into a niche that won\u2019t survive the next economic downturn. To do that, we expanded our services and established a staffing division, two years ago.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Since the Mattox Group was already serving small business clients with tax and accounting services, they had an insider\u2019s perspective on the additional needs of those businesses. Fagan was able to see firsthand how often his clients struggled with recruiting for both temporary and permanent positions. Often, these clients lacked recruiting and staffing expertise, but also lacked the funds to hire executive headhunters to provide assistance.<\/p>\n<p>After studying enough of his small business and nonprofit customers, Fagan saw a market need and a growth opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe already had an engagement with [these clients], and this was a nice opportunity to add value,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re also involved in the veteran community. We recognized there was a need for veterans and military spouses to find gainful employment. We connected these needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Funding a new expansion with Fundbox<\/h2>\n<p>When it came to funding the expansion, Fagan called on Fundbox.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is one reason I fell in love with Fundbox,\u201d he says. \u201cFundbox has have been a lifesaver because they understood a temporary staffing agency. The banks don\u2019t really want to come out and take a risk on that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While major banks typically require a lengthy process and years of business paperwork and proof of revenue or collateral in order to extend a business loan or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\">business line of credit<\/a><\/span>, Fundbox users can be approved without paperwork, on the basis of business data such as QuickBooks records or a business checking account. The Fundbox integration with QuickBooks was initially what got Fagan\u2019s attention.<\/p>\n<p>Though he wasn\u2019t ready for funding yet, he says, he was thinking about what he\u2019d need in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found out about Fundbox at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooksconnect.com\/\">QuickBooks Connect<\/a><\/span>\u00a0three years ago,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAt the time, I was looking for a traditional bank line of credit, because of [my plan for] the new staffing division. I knew I would have to have the cash to make that happen. There was a greater return on investment to start the division rather than wait until we could self-finance it. I think that\u2019s why anybody looks for a traditional line of credit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fundbox was exhibiting at the event, and after meeting the Fundbox team in person, Fagan decided to apply. He was quickly approved for a credit line and started using the funds.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOur partnership with Fundbox has allowed us to start and grow this division. It went from an idea two years ago, to hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue in these first four years. I\u2019m really pleased.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThat little seed was huge. It got us started,\u201d he says. \u201cOur partnership with Fundbox has allowed us to start and grow this division. It went from an idea two years ago, to hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue in these first four years. I\u2019m really pleased.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the years he has worked with Fundbox, his credit line has increased as he built a track record of business success and paying on time. Currently, his line of credit is more than five times what it was when he was first approved. \u201cI could always use more,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cbut it\u2019s growing at just about the right pace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead, he is optimistic about the potential for his business to keep growing: \u201cNow we\u2019ve grown a bit with Fundbox, and it\u2019s allowed us to grow the number of staffing associates that we manage. We\u2019re looking forward to exciting things in 2019.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>J. Alan Fagan is well-acquainted with finding success in tough situations.
