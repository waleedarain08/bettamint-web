Landlords might decide to increase rent. The price of raw materials and supplies might unexpectedly skyrocket overnight. Customers may hesitate to pay their bills on time due to an uncertain economy\u2014not to mention cash flow problems of their own. And healthcare costs, well, that one goes without saying.<\/p>\n<p>Even the most visionary small business owners can\u2019t change that which is out of their control. So even if an owner has been masterfully managing his or her organization\u2019s finances for quite some time, all it takes is one unforeseen obstacle or one unpredictable change to seriously cripple cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>Managing a business is challenging enough. Managing a business that\u2019s suffering from cash flow problems? It\u2019s exceptionally harder, if not downright impossible.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), to avoid <a href=\"http:\/\/www.problems.com\/\">cash flow problems<\/a>, companies would be wise to keep 3\u20136\u00a0months of cash on hand.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That amount, the SBA says, is enough to provide business owners with the peace of mind that comes with knowing they\u2019ll be able to promptly pay their bills and keep their doors open for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine having six months\u2019 worth of cash in your business\u2019 bank account?!<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, stockpiling six months of cash is a whole lot easier said than done.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s good news: Small business owners can reclaim control of their cash flow\u2014and easily overcome any cash flow gaps they might anticipate\u2014by making use of innovative alternative finance solutions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Invoice Financing: Here\u2019s How It Works<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Small business owners can use invoice financing services to advance payments on any outstanding bills their customers have yet to settle. With a simple click of the mouse or tap of the finger, money is transferred directly to the business\u2019 bank account.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Let\u2019s backtrack a bit: Invoice financing services are incredibly easy to use.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>First, you need to set up an account with the invoice financing service of your choice, which only takes a few minutes. (We think Fundbox is the best, but we may be a little biased.) You only need your name, email and phone number, and you also need to choose a password.<\/p>\n<p>Doesn\u2019t sound too hard, right?<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got your account set up, you need to connect it with your accounting app (e.g., QuickBooks, Freshbooks, Harvest, Wave, Xero, etc). After that connection is established, you&#8217;ll see all your outstanding invoices in your account. Depending on how much money you need, you can select particular invoices to clear, and money is sent directly to your business\u2019 bank account.<\/p>\n<p>Crisis averted.<\/p>\n<p>Fundbox, for example, gives you 12 weeks to repay the advance, plus a small fee. If you happen to pay the advance before the 12-week period is up, we waive the remainder of the fee. Curious as to how much that fee is? You can check out our transparent pricing model here for further information.<\/p>\n<p>With a service like Fundbox at your disposal, you won\u2019t have to worry about scraping together the cash to meet payroll, settle your bills or invest in your business\u2019 growth. The money you\u2019re owed is always within reach, and you won\u2019t have to harass your customers about when you can expect a check.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, invoice financing services allow you to turn the page on your small business\u2019 cash flow problems. And once that\u2019s done, you can dictate the next chapters of your company\u2019s history.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Though a vast majority of small business owners certainly understand how important access to liquid cash is, 60 percent of &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":3166,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11532],"yst_prominent_words":[839,1165,723,1719,1718,719,3202,713,705,5782,3198,714,846,753,5781,5783,1157,837,712,709],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Solve Your Cash Flow Problems with Invoice Financing","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Though a vast majority of small business owners certainly understand how important access to liquid cash is, 60 percent of small businesses still regularly deal with cash flow problems."},{"property":"og:locale","content":"en_US"},{"property":"og:type","content":"article"},{"property":"og:title","content":"How to Solve Your Cash Flow Problems with Invoice Financing"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Though a vast majority of small business owners certainly understand how important access to liquid cash is, 60 percent of small businesses still regularly deal with cash flow problems."},{"property":"og:url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-solve-your-cash-flow-problems-with-invoice-financing\/"},{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Fundbox"},{"property":"article:publisher","content":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/"},{"property":"og:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/1382727353000-1025-MQT-A11.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:secure_url","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/1382727353000-1025-MQT-A11.jpg"},{"property":"og:image:width","content":"880"},{"property":"og:image:height","content":"495"},{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:description","content":"Though a vast majority of small business owners certainly understand how important access to liquid cash is, 60 percent of small businesses still regularly deal with cash flow problems."},{"name":"twitter:title","content":"How to Solve Your Cash Flow Problems with Invoice Financing"},{"name":"twitter:site","content":"@fundbox"},{"name":"twitter:image","content":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/1382727353000-1025-MQT-A11.jpg"},{"name":"twitter:creator","content":"@fundbox"}],"yoast_json_ld":[{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebSite","@id":"#website","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/","name":"Fundbox Blog","potentialAction":{"@type":"SearchAction","target":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s={search_term_string}","query-input":"required name=search_term_string"}},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","url":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-solve-your-cash-flow-problems-with-invoice-financing\/","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fundbox\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/fundbox\/","https:\/\/twitter.com\/fundbox"],"@id":"#organization","name":"Fundbox","logo":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/img\/brand-logo.png"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3407"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/14"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3407"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3407\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9993,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3407\/revisions\/9993"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3166"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3407"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3407"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3407"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=3407"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
