Do you think your business does what it does and there\u2019s no possibility you\u2019d succeed if you tried something entirely different?<\/p>\n<p>If so, you might find it liberating to learn that you do have the power to change these perceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Carol Dweck, Ph.D., is a professor at Stanford who\u2019s the pioneer of mindset research; she\u2019s been studying the power of mindset for decades.<\/p>\n<p>She argues that our mindset dictates our behavior. It\u2019s our way of thinking about ourselves and the world that governs the way we act.<\/p>\n<p>Dweck argues there are two kinds of mindsets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">fixed mindset <\/span>tells us intelligence is something we\u2019re born with. We\u2019re dealt a certain hand and there\u2019s nothing we can do to change it.<\/li>\n<li>A <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">growth mindset <\/span>says we can improve ourselves every day.

We all have the ability to become better and better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, <\/span>Dweck chronicles her extensive mindset research and leaves readers with a simple yet incredibly powerful takeaway: The way we think about our lives\u2014whether it\u2019s work or school or personal relationships\u2014plays an enormous role in the outcomes we experience.<\/p>\n<p>Business success, per Dweck, starts with having the right outlook on our capabilities, which is made possible with a growth mindset. We need to accept we\u2019re not perfect and we need to strive to consistently improve. It\u2019s all possible so long as our brains tell us we actually want to.<\/p>\n<p>Read the book to find out what you can do to adopt a growth mindset\u2014or, if you\u2019re already there, use it to reach your full potential.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/73330071-56ef-415f-8b87-b4501bc2cbce_pasted20image200.png\" alt=\"Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini\/dp\/006124189X\/\">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0by Dr. Robert Cialdini<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>What makes people say <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">yes<\/span>?

If your enemy (i.e., your competitor) knows what you\u2019re doing before you\u2019ve actually done it, you\u2019ll be easier to defeat. What might that mean for your business?

It does, however, require significant amounts of time and a bit of cunning.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of buying expensive ads in a newspaper or magazine\u2014or even online\u2014devise a clever PR stunt for your small business to get coverage for free. For example, if you\u2019re opening up a new <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/digitally-advertise-landscaping-business\/\">landscaping business<\/a><\/span>, hire a juggler, head to the busy part of town and give out swag (e.g., T-shirts) and coupons to whoever\u2019s around. Similarly, instead of trying to get new people to buy your products with a well-designed ad or banner, give them away for free to generate interest.<\/p>\n<p>Bottom line? What worked for small businesses 30 years ago no longer applies. A little creativity and a willingness to invest your time in unconventional marketing endeavors can go a long way toward the success of your small business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for productivity tips, wondering how to market your business better and persuade your customers more effectively, or &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":9166,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,10158,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[5541,723,719,8619,8623,8622,8616,8617,6420,712,709,2127,8621,8620,8612,8611],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"top-left-risks","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"12 of the Best Books for Business Owners &amp; Entrepreneurs | Fundbox","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Whether you\u2019re looking for productivity tips, wanting to become a more impactful manager, or something else, there\u2019s something on this list for you.
