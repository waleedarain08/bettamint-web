And even organizations that crushed it in 2015 can\u2019t rest on their laurels; their competitors certainly aren\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to say you want to grow your business. It\u2019s another thing to actually do it. Here are three ways to back up your words with actions:<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">1. Utilize new technologies.<\/strong><br \/>\nAre you equipping your workers with the technologies they need to be most productive? When is the last time you invested in new tools, anyway?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve not yet begun leveraging a unified communications platform or any collaboration tools, for example, your staff won\u2019t be able to communicate as effectively with their colleagues and business partners. You can use platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/asana.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asana<\/a>, nCore and <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello<\/a> to enable your staff to collaborate in real-time with their coworkers, thereby accelerating decision making and driving business efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, if you\u2019ve not yet migrated to the cloud, what are you waiting for? Thanks to the rise of 4G networks and the proliferation of high quality mobile devices, today\u2019s workers are able to be productive anywhere at any time. By leveraging cloud platforms and supporting mobility, you\u2019re guaranteed to see a measurable uptick in output.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, is your small business as a whole leveraging the right products and services it needs to make it to the next level?<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re company is regularly struggling with cash flow problems because your clients aren\u2019t paying their bills on time, thanks to new technologies, you no longer have to wait around twiddling your thumbs until checks come in. Instead, you can use an invoice-clearing service like <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?utm_medium=content&amp;utm_source=blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> to advance payments on outstanding invoices. For a small fee, Fundbox provides quick access to the funds you\u2019re owed. You then have 12 weeks to repay the advance and the fee.<\/p>\n<p>The end result? Cash flow problems become a thing of the past, and your business can always access the funds it needs to grow.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. Expand into new markets.<\/strong><br \/>\nWhen\u2019s the last time your small business tried to branch out into a new market?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re hoping to grow your operations in 2016, it might be time to think about how you can build relationships with a whole new set of customers.<\/p>\n<p>For some business, that means expanding into new markets. A small company that sells sauces, dressings and marinades to restaurants, for example, might decide it\u2019s time to open a new location a few states away to attract a whole new set of clients.<\/p>\n<p>For other businesses, it might mean opening an ecommerce store.<\/p>\n<p>If your small business is one that could sell products to customers via the Internet and you don\u2019t have an ecommerce store, make opening one a priority in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Need some more convincing? The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internetretailer.com\/2015\/02\/17\/us-annual-e-retail-sales-surpass-300-billion-first-ti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. ecommerce market<\/a> hauled in an impressive $264 billion in 2013. And that number exploded to $305 billion in 2014. It remains to be seen how much the market will realize in 2015. But <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/11\/27\/black-friday-boost-will-it-be-enough.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sluggish Black Friday sales<\/a> at brick-and-mortar stores suggest we\u2019ll see a similarly impressive increase.<\/p>\n<p>It would be absolutely shocking if we didn\u2019t see yet another uptick in 2016.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. Develop new products.<\/strong><br \/>\nHas it been awhile since you released any new products or services?<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t updated your product portfolio in some time, consider setting aside a good chunk of time during the beginning of 2016 to do precisely that. Keep in mind that you don\u2019t even necessarily have to create anything new; you might be able to conceive of a new market for an existing product, or even a new use for it.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing a blank as to what your customers might want? What better way to figure that out than to solicit their feedback directly.<\/p>\n<p>Who knows? Your next idea might strike gold.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck in 2016!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The New Year brings with it a fresh beginning.
