We\u2019ve seen, over and over, that in running a business, obsession and passion for what you do often pays huge dividends. For Fundbox customer Guy Bauer, owner and founder of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Guy Bauer Productions<\/span>, a creative video production agency in Chicago, IL, that\u2019s definitely been the case. Since he began his agency nearly a decade ago out of his home, he\u2019s focused his effort on delivering high-quality work for every single project, while also continually seeking personal growth and improvement as a leader to his growing staff.<\/p>\n<p>Now the head of one of Chicago\u2019s top video production agencies, Guy has come a long way from his start as a \u201csingle video dude working in his bedroom.\u201d He\u2019s learned a ton about leading a team, managing clients, business financing, and cash flow. We gave him a call to talk about the most brutal lessons he learned from his early projects, and how he uses Fundbox to keep his business growing, even in the slow months.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_9596\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9596\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-9596\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GuyBauer-headshot-2018-800px.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GuyBauer-headshot-2018-800px.jpg 800w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GuyBauer-headshot-2018-800px-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/GuyBauer-headshot-2018-800px-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-9596\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Guy Bauer, owner of Guy Bauer Productions<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox:<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0Guy, tell us about yourself and your company. How did you get started, and how has your life changed since you began the business?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Guy Bauer:<\/span>\u00a0I started my agency as a single video dude out of my second bedroom. The reason I started by myself in 2010 was simply because I could not find a job! I had video training, but I had no business background. It was during the Great Recession and it was just awful. In the beginning, I did literally everything for the business, which was really challenging for me.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Today, Guy Bauer Productions is a multi-million dollar company and I tell you&#8230;it\u2019s not easy growing, from leading a small video firm, into being a real executive with 30 employees. Those people are all looking at me to know what I\u2019m doing and sometimes, I don\u2019t. But that\u2019s also the fun of business!<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">These days, I\u2019m trying to limit myself to focusing on sales and quality control. I help sell, since it\u2019s my name on the door, and then I work to maintain our quality. Without that high quality, we would have nothing.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox:<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Can you share some of your biggest challenges and you\u2019ve faced around cash flow and operating your business successfully?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GB:<\/span>\u00a0Cash is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">everything<\/span>. I learned a gigantic cash flow lesson early on, in 2011. My company was just me at the time, hanging on by a thread. I got a new account and a big rush job for $15k, which represented a quarter of what I did in revenue at the time\u2014it was a huge deal for me. I delivered their video and sent the invoice, due immediately. I couldn\u2019t wait to get my check&#8230;and then they said, \u201cWe\u2019re Net-120.\u201d I had to look that up! I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t wait 4 months!<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The client was so happy. They were going to hire me again. Yet, I was broke! I had to use my own money: I cleaned out my savings account to pay for the plane tickets to get to this job. I went broke to do this job. I did not have payroll or overhead at that point, so I just sort of starved for a couple of months. But imagine if I had overhead: I would have gone out of business, for doing amazing work and making that client happy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">After that I knew the game. You must stay in business long enough to get paid!<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Access to financing at the right time helps us do that. My goal is to eventually have enough retained earnings to need less financing, but right now it\u2019s crucial. In the past, I withdrew our whole line from Fundbox, and thank God for Fundbox.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You can\u2019t run a business off of debt forever, but if your business is fundamentally profitable and healthy, then financing options like Fundbox allow you to take the edge off those valleys in your cash flow.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox:<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0Transitioning from being a solo entrepreneur to managing 30 employees is tough, but you\u2019ve clearly succeeded in making that leap. What\u2019s been most important for you in that process?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GB:<\/span>\u00a0There are so many things. It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do. I know video inside and out. I\u2019ve been doing video since the 7th grade. But managing other people? I\u2019ve only been doing that since 2012!<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The biggest mistake I see a lot of people make is that they are in business for the wrong reason, and they take their foot off the gas. Maybe they get five years in and they get distracted. Maybe they start taking a higher salary or more profits and putting it in to the trappings of success: the cool office space with expensive furniture, or a fancy car. Those people lose the scrappiness that got them there when they start believing they \u201cmade it\u201d\u2014and they take their foot off the gas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Not me; I am pedal to the metal. I was up at 4 a.m. today. I had a 12-hour work day and that\u2019s my standard day. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is, if you don\u2019t bring it, every day, you open up room for competitors to steal your secret sauce. I never stop improving. Every day, I\u2019m in it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Now, the way I defined \u201cworking hard\u201d six years ago was different. Today, it\u2019s planning, strategizing, managing, and doing sales. The role has changed, but the effort hasn\u2019t changed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox: <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What would you most want to say to other business owners when it comes to managing your finances?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GB:<\/span>\u00a0Using financing is good as long as you\u2019re smart about it. You can use it, but there must be an ROI on the debt. I know I can out-earn what I pay in fees.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">We\u2019re getting a lot better with cash flow forecasting. For example, we get a ton of cash in May, June, July, because that\u2019s when things start coming it.\u00a0We use a cash flow forecasting software service to see into the future of our cash.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox:<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0Has your approach to financing changed over time? How?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GB:<\/span>\u00a0I used to be very financially undisciplined. The good thing is that the business was growing, and a high growth business can mask a lot of stupidity. In the past, I might use Fundbox to make payroll if I noticed, Oh crap, payroll\u2019s tomorrow!<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Now, as a more experienced manager, I can be more strategic. For example, in the past, I might pay for major expenses like a new camera in cash, but then find myself needing to borrow cash soon after, meaning that I was essentially financing that purchase. These days, if we make a withdrawal on Fundbox, we have planned ahead, and know where and how we will need to use it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Fundbox is fast, and I can rely on it. Now, I use it more for operational expenses, rather than for capital purchases.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Fundbox:<\/span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How has that access to extra funds helped you grow?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GB<\/span>: Financing has allowed me not to be so paycheck to paycheck. It levels out the troughs. Psychologically as well\u2014you know you are not going to hit a brick wall. You won\u2019t have to empty your accounts, or miss payroll, to take on a big job.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The reality is, clients are late! They are late paying. The biggest lie in business is, \u201cThe check is in the mail.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">For us, Fundbox is the confidence that one late check will be ok.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>You can find Guy Bauer Productions in Chicago and online.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guy Bauer Productions uses Fundbox to fund strategic growth and explosive success At Fundbox, our obsession is giving business owners &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":61,"featured_media":9577,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11504],"yst_prominent_words":[9097,9120,9093,723,719,3202,713,2469,9092,838,9098,9090,9119,9089,9095,9091,1427,1111,9096,9094],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"circle","preview_color":"blue","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How This Video Agency Funds Strategic Growth | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"&quot;Financing has allowed me not to be so paycheck to paycheck.
