Just check the staggering statistics: mobile devices <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zenithmedia.com\/mobile-forecasts-75-internet-use-will-mobile-2017\/\">account for 80% of global internet usage<\/a><\/span>\u00a0today. This means that the majority of the traffic to your website will almost definitely be mobile users. This also means that it\u2019s more important than ever to provide your visitors with a great mobile web experience.<\/p>\n<p>Having a mobile-optimized website for your business will also pay SEO dividends. Google will also rank your site based on the mobile version as part of its <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751\">mobile first indexation<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>If your site provides a lackluster mobile experience, then Google will probably rank your site lower in search results. All of the tips I give in this crash course revolve around sending traffic to your website, so make sure that you are providing the best user experience possible. Once you send people to your site, you want them to stay and find what they need there.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/657ea251-b58f-482b-87b0-4a94de0ec1ed_bigstock-222069088.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Using Responsive Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to accomplish this is through the use of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">responsive<\/span>\u00a0web design.<\/p>\n<p>What is responsive web design? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/01\/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design\/\">Smashing Magazine<\/a><\/span>\u00a0defines it as, \u201cthe approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user\u2019s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, when you\u2019re designing responsively, you\u2019re designing a website to fit any device it\u2019s rendered on, as opposed to the more old-fashioned practice of creating separate websites for desktop and mobile.<\/p>\n<p>For SEO purposes, it\u2019s important to note that<a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/mobile-sites\/mobile-seo\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/mobile-sites\/mobile-seo\/\">Google has openly endorsed the responsive design approach<\/a><\/span>. So, if you want to rank higher in online searches, this is a good thing to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, I\u2019ve seen an incredible increase (in one case, even 100%+ increase) in mobile leads when we re-designed homepages to better cater to mobile users.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Here\u2019s an example, before optimizing for mobile:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/b5eb71ed-ecfb-4a0f-9eca-9ccdf6948583_warriors-heart-before.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">After re-designing with responsive design:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/5c2ea74c-06b6-4246-a96a-c60376b520b1_warriors-heart-after.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can see they look quite different, and the \u201cAfter\u201d shot is much more friendly to users navigating from their smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>The message is clear: a great mobile experience for users is incredibly important to your overall digital marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be a complete redesign, just be sure to have the important information readily available to a mobile user: Phone number, contact button, store hours etc. Take a look at your mobile homepage and ask yourself if it\u2019s easy to use or find the information a potential user would be looking for.<\/p>\n<h2>Responsive Design Action Items<\/h2>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t yet migrated your business website, now is the time. Here are some actions you can take right away to get the ball rolling and start moving your web presence toward a more user-friendly experience. If you do, you should be rewarded with happier customers, better search rankings, and more sales.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">Run a speed test<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/test\/mobile-friendly\">Run a mobile friendly test<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li>Make sure there is a clear &#8216;call to action&#8217; on mobile. (Examples of calls to action could be, \u201cCall Now\u201d or, \u201cGet a FREE Quote!\u201d)<\/li>\n<li>Go through your mobile site and experience it as a user. Notice what\u2019s difficult to find or do and consider how to make it more pleasant, then work with your web developer or designer to implement those insights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Catch up on Part 1 of the Digital Marketing Crash Course for business owners: <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation\/\">Earn More Sales With Email Marketing Automation<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fundbox customer and digital marketing expert Guillermo Ortiz\u00a0is sharing his knowledge to help business owners improve their online presence and &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":73,"featured_media":9357,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10158],"yst_prominent_words":[719,8853,1976,8850,8848,8861,8860,1771,8744,8737,8742,8851,771,8855,2181,8854,8849,8862,8852,5694],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Improve Your Sales With a Mobile Friendly Website | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Having a mobile-optimized website for your business is not just important; it&#039;s imperative for the success of your business marketing.
