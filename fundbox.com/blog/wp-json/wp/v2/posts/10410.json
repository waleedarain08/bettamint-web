According to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/risk\/our-insights\/the-lending-revolution-how-digital-credit-is-changing-banks-from-the-inside\">McKinsey<\/a><\/span>, banks and traditional lenders typically take 3 to 5 weeks to decide whether or not to fund a small business, while the average time to funding is approximately 3 months.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, online fintech financiers generally give pre-approval in 5 minutes and can even provide funding in as little as 3 hours. The average time to funding with alternative financiers is 3 days. That\u2019s quite a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Even though online lenders are inherently fast, there are ways to speed up your business loan\u00a0process even more. In this article, we\u2019ll look at some examples and insights from Lending Express to learn how you can speed up the process for yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>How did this business get funds so fast?<\/h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s one recent example of a business owner who succeeded in getting financing quickly. A renovation company in Miami, Florida applied for business funding through Lending Express\u00a0in January this year, was approved for a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\">line of credit<\/a> from Fundbox within 15 minutes, and received their funding just three hours later.\u00a0The business owner shared that he will be using his line of credit to purchase new equipment for his business.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the things this business owner did to get funded:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>He linked his bank account to his funding application, which provided his lender with an immediate snapshot of his financial information.<\/li>\n<li>He responded quickly to communication about his application.<\/li>\n<li>The business owner signed off on his loan offer without delay.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s delve deeper into how to speed up the process when you apply for a business loan:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Link your bank account<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of emailing or uploading your bank statements, when applying for funds online, you should look for an online loan marketplace or fintech financier that allows you to link your bank account directly to your loan application.<\/p>\n<p>This is possible when you apply for business funding through Lending Express. This is an example of \u201copen banking,\u201d which is a secure way to give third-party providers or applications access to your bank data using technology. Linking your bank account is a good example of\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Open_banking\">open banking<\/a><\/span>, a major trend in the financial industry\u00a0which will likely grow in importance in 2019.<\/p>\n<p>When you apply for a business loan through a financial technology company, you will often have the option of securely linking your bank account. For example, if you decide to apply for funding with Lending Express, you can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">securely link your bank account<\/span>\u00a0through their partnership with leading open banking API, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2018\/12\/11\/mary-meekers-first-post-kleiner-deal-fintech-startup-plaid-now-valued-at-265-billion\/#2c24ea6c77d6\">Plaid<\/a><\/span>. Plaid acts as a bridge between your loan application and your bank account and is secure in the following important ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lenders on the platform get <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">view-only<\/span>\u00a0access<\/li>\n<li>Data viewed\u00a0by the lender is information that you would share anyway such as bank statements<\/li>\n<li>Your login details are not saved<\/li>\n<li>Data is fully encrypted<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How can linking your bank account speed up your loan application?<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data is in real-time <\/span>&#8211; the lender gets the most current information about your business\u2019s financial health.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Immediate access <\/span>&#8211; the second you link your bank account, the lender can view your business health. No administrative\u00a0delay waiting for you to collect your data.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One information source <\/span>&#8211; because the lender can access everything it needs to assess your business from one source, there\u2019s no time wasted collecting documentation from different sources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>According to Jordan Ruas, Director of Sales at Lending Express, \u201c33\u00a0percent of our\u00a0customers in the US linked their bank accounts to their loan applications,\u201d as of January 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis results in speeding up their process and getting them more accurate loan offers,\u201d says Ruas. \u201cWe expect this number to grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>2. Respond right away<\/h2>\n<p>There are many potential <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">benefits of digital lending<\/span>. One of them is that you\u2019ll usually be notified as soon as you\u2019ve unlocked a funding opportunity, so the quicker you respond and claim your offer, the quicker you\u2019ll get your funds.<\/p>\n<p>Lending Express can\u2019t vouch for all digital lenders or platforms, but when applying for a business loan with the company, as soon as you\u2019ve claimed your loan offer, the lender will contact you to give final approval and possibly request documentation (if needed) within 24 hours. You\u2019ll be notified by email which lender or lenders will be calling you and also asking for documentation, where applicable.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of where you apply for funding, always be on the lookout for an email or call from your lender. Make sure to answer your phone and open their emails, so that you don\u2019t miss any important communication about your loan application.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Complete your application form accurately<\/h2>\n<p>There are really two parts to this point:<\/p>\n<p>1. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Complete <\/span>your loan application<\/p>\n<p>2. Be <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">accurate<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t answer every required question, your funding may be delayed.<\/p>\n<p>If you answer incorrectly or dishonestly, your funding may be delayed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA common issue we see over\u00a0and over again is businesses not declaring their past judgments, liens, or bankruptcies in their loan applications,\u201d says Ruas. \u201cAnother issue that slows down the process is when someone claims to be a business owner, but it turns out they aren\u2019t and are applying on someone else&#8217;s behalf.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This non-disclosure always comes back to bite applicants by delaying their application process, as lenders can find this information out anyway during the finalization of the application and during a credit check.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYears of experience dealing with over 110,000 business owners at Lending Express has taught us that being honest in your application is the best way to speed up your business loan process,\u201d says Ruas. \u201cThe only way to get the best loan possible is if you are completely transparent about any issues.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Common items about which business owners applying for loans might be tempted to hide include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defaults on previous loans or debts<\/li>\n<li>Any existing loans<\/li>\n<li>Low credit score or thin credit file<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cIf you get it right the first time,\u201d explains Ruas, \u201cthere\u2019ll be no going back and forth, wasting your time and the lender\u2019s time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In general, transparency and communication are key. Simply by being open and specific about what you want from your lender can speed things up. The same goes for the lender or financial firm. for any relationship to work, communication needs to be a two-way street.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bottom Line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Even though you\u2019re likely to get your business loan in a matter of days or even hours if you apply online, you can still speed things up even more by following these steps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em><small>This guest article was contributed by Nici Pellimer of Lending Express.<\/small><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><small>Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
