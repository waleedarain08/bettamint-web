But what about B2B companies? Building customer loyalty is just as important for you. In fact, 44 percent of B2B companies report that 60 percent or more of their <em>new<\/em> sales are made to existing customers, according to a study by Loyalty360 reported in MarketingProfs. Here are 8 effective ways to create\u00a0b2b loyalty:<\/p>\n<h2>Start them off right.<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve delivered your product or service to a new customer, ensure they know how to make the most of it. Provide training if necessary\u2014either in-person or online\u2014so they can use your product or service correctly to maximize its value. Follow up to see if they are satisfied or if they need additional assistance (or other add-ons).<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Share useful content.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once the basic how-to\u2019s are handled, keep providing customers with valuable content to help them run a better business. The goal is to educate them\u2014not just about the product or service they\u2019ve purchased, but about all the ways your company can continue to help them in the future. Explain how advanced features or add-on services can make their lives easier. Sharing content related to your industry\u2014not just your business\u2014will help position you as a valuable resource for customers.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Communicate regularly. <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For best results, let your customers choose how they want to receive communications from you. Some may prefer email newsletters; others may want to view videos; still others may like listening to podcasts. Try creating your content in multiple formats so customers can select the one that best suits their needs. And remember, plenty of customers still like communicating in person\u2014so schedule times to check in by phone, drop by their offices or meet for coffee.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Host events.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Hosting events for loyal customers is a smart way to strengthen ties while showing how much you appreciate their business. Hence, try hosting an awards dinner to honor the customers who\u2019ve gained the best results from working with you; inviting customers to a quarterly luncheon; taking individual customers out to ball games, golf or dinner; or inviting customers to your company\u2019s holiday party.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Hold educational gatherings.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Consider hosting a conference or seminar for your customers. You can partner with one or more complementary businesses to boost attendance and share the burden of planning. Customers appreciate the chance to network and learn new things while you and the other partner companies get the opportunity to highlight customer success stories, new products or new services.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Make them feel special.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Giving loyal customers early access to a new product or service or inviting them to participate in product testing or focus groups makes them feel like part of an elite group. Consequently, they will also feel more invested in your business once they\u2019ve provided you with feedback on product or service development.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Connect online.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Customer relationships start in the real world, but interacting online helps cement the ties. Have each member of your sales team take just 15 minutes every day to connect with a certain number of clients on social media. Making an encouraging comment on a post or sharing a useful hyperlink is all it takes to keep your company top-of-mind.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get their feedback.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Perform an annual or semiannual check-in with customers. Visit their business to find out what their current challenges are?\u00a0How they\u2019re using your product or service? What issues you can help them with? This is the time to get honest feedback about how well your product or service is (or isn\u2019t). Therefore,\u00a0paying attention to customers\u2019 wants and needs not only makes them feel cared for, but can also guide your company\u2019s future growth\u00a0by meeting customers&#8217;\u00a0needs, and what they\u2019d like to see in the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Create loyal B2B customers for your company B2C companies have plenty of loyalty marketing tools at their fingertips\u2014from loyalty cards &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":1526,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[72,11504,10158],"yst_prominent_words":[2218,2220,723,1098,757,822,938,798,1154,2221,2222,2223,2216,2224,2217,1188,2219,1657,1651,864],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"8 Secrets to Creating Customer Loyalty","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Creating customer loyalty is key to smb success.
