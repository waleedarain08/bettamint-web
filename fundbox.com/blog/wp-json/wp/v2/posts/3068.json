But as Thomas Corley, author of <em>Rich Habits: The Daily Habits of Successful People<\/em> found when he spent five years researching the financial habits of \u201cwealthy people\u201d ( defined as having annual income of $160,000+ and net worth of $3.2 million), the sum total of all your little financial habits has major bearing on whether you\u2019ll be a rich entrepreneur, or a poor one.<\/p>\n<p>Here are ten small but mighty financial behaviors all entrepreneurs should embrace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Check in with your finances each month. <\/strong>You can\u2019t manage financial activity you don\u2019t know about. In Corley\u2019s research, 94% of the \u201cwealthy\u201d respondents (many of whom were \u201cself-made\u201d) were in the habit of balancing their checkbooks and checking in with their finances at the end of each month to see where they stood\u2014compared to just 32% of the \u201cpoor\u201d respondents, who he defined as those with a liquid net worth of less than $5,000.<\/p>\n<p>Though it can be tempting to look the other way when your bank account isn\u2019t where you want it to be, keeping your eye on your eye on the financial facts of your business ensures you can choose your best course of action, versus being left to react to whatever the competitive environment presents.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Use credit cards strategically. <\/strong>Credit cards may feel like the easiest place to turn when you\u2019re boot strapping a business, but their high interest rates and potential impact on your personal credit score can jeopardize your long term financial success&#8211; particularly if you charge expenses you can\u2019t cover in full. Not only did Corley\u2019s data indicate only 5% of the rich carry a balance on their credit card (compared to 90% of the poor), those that did never let their credit card balance exceed $5,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Put your goals on paper. <\/strong>What are your financial goals for your business today, this week, this month\u2014and this year? How close are you to reaching them? Ask these questions habitually, and hold yourself accountable. Nearly 70% of the rich respondents to Corley\u2019s study said they always write down their goals; 67% of them set new goals each year\u2014and 62% set new goals for each day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Use the professionals to your advantage. <\/strong>Admitting you are not a financial expert doesn\u2019t make you a less successful entrepreneur; it makes you wise. In fact, 100% of the \u201cwealthy\u201d respondents to Corley\u2019s study use a certified public accountant to guide them in their financial decisions. (As an entrepreneur, you have the added bonus of being able to deduct those professional fees as a cost of doing business when you file taxes).<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Be your own brand ambassador. <\/strong>Who you know can help you succeed as a business owner, but you have to invest the time to build your personal entrepreneurial brand. More than 60% of the wealthy respondents to Corley\u2019s study said that \u201cself-promoting\u201d is important to obtaining financial success; more than half use their lunch hour to network, and nearly 80% spent at least five hours a month making new business connections.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one bucket. <\/strong>Owning a business isn\u2019t unlike investing in the stock market. Though opportunities for the greatest rewards often involve risk, you\u2019re less exposed to uncertainty\u2014and better primed for success&#8211;when you diversify. Consider ways to reduce your own dependence on own sole source of income: 65% of the wealthy respondents in Corley\u2019s study had at least three income streams.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Stay aware of your financial surroundings. <\/strong>Staying in tune with the broader financial environment that impacts your businesses\u2019 finances\u2014including interest rates, lending options, investment opportunities, global stock market activity and changes in tax laws&#8211; equips you to be proactive in your conversations with financial professionals\u2014even if you ultimately rely on their advice. Nearly half of the \u201cwealthy\u201d surveyed by Corley they regularly read financial news from credible sources like the <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Value all of your relationships. <\/strong>You may work for yourself (and even by yourself), but to be a financially successful entrepreneur, your relationships and ability to reach your business goals are not mutually exclusive. Of the wealthy Corley studied, 80% made phone calls to tell the people they know \u201chappy birthday,\u201d to connect during life events, and simply to check in and say hello. Nearly 90% said that their relationships are critical to financial success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Establish a savings cushion. <\/strong>Saving money can be hard when you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019re in a financial position to collect a steady salary, but the wealthy in Corley\u2019s study all saved at least 10% of more of their net income\u2014and all contributed at least something to retirement. Regardless of how much money you\u2019re able to draw as the business owner, make sure you consistently pay yourself\u2014in a savings account, and self-employed retirement plan\u2014 every time payday comes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Don\u2019t forget the feeling of being cash-strapped. <\/strong> Even when business is going well and it seems you have plenty of cash\u2014spend wisely. Nearly 70% of the wealthy surveyed described their spending habits as \u201cfrugal.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s easy to take the focus off your financial behaviors when you\u2019re busy trying to build a successful business.
