A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dealstruck.com\/press_release\/dealstruck-survey-70-of-small-businesses-struggle-with-finding-talent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey<\/a> by online lender, Dealstruck, found that 97% of small businesses anticipate that they will either grow or remain stable next year.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing on new talent is a key foundation of growth, and 56% of small businesses surveyed say they plan to hire in 2016. But hiring great talent is a perpetual challenge, 70% say that they are unable to find qualified talent \u2013 a very real threat to growing their businesses.<\/p>\n<p>[Tweet &#8220;70% of small businesses say that they are unable to find qualified talent.&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>One of the problems is that these businesses (46%) rely heavily on word of mouth, only 10% advertise and only 10% use online career websites like Monster. Another problem is that almost a quarter of those surveyed can\u2019t afford to hire, or lack the finance needed.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two ways you can address those challenges head on:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Identify the Right Hiring Methods for Your Business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As you can see from the data above, small businesses tend not to place too many employment ads on sites like Monster. It\u2019s easy to see why. These sites attract huge numbers of applications that can be overwhelming. They are also not very targeted. Instead, consider working with a staffing agency (who does a lot of the screening work for you) or posting very precise and targeted ads on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with word of mouth, and it can work well\u00a0if your position is clearly defined. Help those who are spreading the word for you by sharing a job description. Here are some tips to write the perfect job description in four steps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Find New Ways to Finance your Hiring Plans<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are some options for growing your business with new hires or even funding payroll. The SBA operates a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/category\/navigation-structure\/loans-grants\/small-business-loans-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">small business loan programs<\/a> based on your financing needs. The SBA doesn\u2019t provide the funding, instead it works with a number of lending partners to eliminate the risk of working with small businesses by guaranteeing that these loans will be repaid.<\/p>\n<p>Another small business friendly option is your local credit union. They often provide lower rates and fees. Read more here.<\/p>\n<p>Another popular option for small business comes in the form of alternative finance. Firms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundera<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lendio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lendio<\/a>\u00a0have one mission, to make it easier and more affordable for small business owners to find and secure the right kind of capital.
