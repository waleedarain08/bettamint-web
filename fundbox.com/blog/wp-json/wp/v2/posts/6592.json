Establishing a credit history and building good business credit are essential to the success of your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re wondering how to build business credit, it\u2019s important to understand one of its key contributing factors: your<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/increase-business-credit-score\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business credit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you&#8217;re seeking financing, showing your creditworthiness will be a big part of applying and getting approved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But your business credit profile (and business credit score) come up in more situations, too. For example, if you\u2019re looking to negotiate good terms with your suppliers, get the best lease on commercial property, or secure good insurance premiums, your good business credit could help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, good business credit makes for a sustainable, growth-oriented business. Here are some things you can do to help build good business credit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 things you can do to establish and build your business credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Check your personal and business credit files<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing you want to do is check your personal and business credit score. For your personal score, go to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.annualcreditreport.com\/index.action\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AnnualCreditReport.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a free source of credit reports <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumer.ftc.gov\/articles\/0155-free-credit-reports\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">verified by the government<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and operated by the three national reporting companies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. By Federal law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from the credit bureaus every 12 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/analyze-business-credit-report\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">check your report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for errors. Look for any inaccuracies in every section, including your personal information, SSN, accounts, and loans. Report any incorrect information to the business that issued the account or the credit reporting company that issued the report.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, check out your business credit report. You can request these from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dnb.com\/products\/small-business\/check-my-business-credit.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/small-business\/business-credit-reports.jsp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experian<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.equifax.com\/business\/business-credit-reports-small-business\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equifax<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you don\u2019t have a credit file with these agencies or are new to business, you can set one up by registering for a D-U-N-S number (used to identify companies in the U.S.) with Dun &amp; Bradstreet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add trade references to your credit file<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade references are vital to a strong business credit score. These reflect your good record of payments with suppliers and vendors. Some will be proactive about sharing this information with the credit reporting agencies, but they aren\u2019t required to do so. You can also add them on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your score is determined by a few things, including the number of trade experiences you have, outstanding balances, payment habits, and demographics (such as years on file, business size, etc.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establish credit with vendors and suppliers who report to credit bureaus<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all vendors, suppliers, businesses, and others with whom your business interacts will report to the credit bureaus. But working with those who do is a way to build business credit and boost your business credit score. A history of responsible payment (on time, or even early) builds good business credit, so ask your vendors and others whether they report your payment activity. Your strong credit rating may help you increase your borrowing power, obtain more favorable financing terms from lenders, or increase the likelihood of other businesses working with you.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a business credit card<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/best-business-credit-card\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business credit cards<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be an indispensable asset for any business. Of course, you can use this card to pay for business expenses such as supplies and equipment, and most cards come with perks such as cash back or travel rewards. But equally important, if you use it responsibly and reliably pay on time, a business credit card can also be leveraged to build strong business credit history and a solid credit rating, potentially helping your business qualify for additional \u2014 and better \u2014 financing options in the future, should you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do keep in mind that if you\u2019re looking to finance large purchases of equipment or to capitalize on a timely but costly opportunity for your business\u2019s growth, a business credit card likely will not be sufficient for your needs. A better, more flexible financing option for such purchases is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-business-line-credit-can-help-grow-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which offers a revolving balance that replenishes as you pay off what you\u2019ve used. If you\u2019re looking for a line of credit for your business, you may want to consider a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/get-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox Line of Credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Make payments to creditors on time or early<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your payment habits have a big impact on your credit score. If you pay before a due date, or even 15-30 days in advance (cash flow permitting), you\u2019ll improve your Dun &amp; Bradstreet Paydex score. The Paydex score ranges from 1\u2013100 and is an important indicator of a business\u2019s past payment performance. The higher the Paydex score, the greater the likelihood that a business will pay its debts on time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor your business credit reports<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019ve spent so much time building your credit, keep an eye on it. As noted, you are able to access your personal credit report for free on an annual basis, and it\u2019s a smart idea to do just that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may want to keep even closer track of your business credit report. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/free-business-credit-report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 5 places you can go to check your business credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But you most likely want to check your business credit report much more frequently than once per year. If you want to check it on a monthly basis, look to any of the top business credit agencies (Experian, Equifax, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet). They all offer a range of business credit monitoring services, but be aware that you will likely have to pay for this, and prices vary. However, monitoring is important if you\u2019re actively looking to build credit. Monitoring will let you know when new activity is detected and allow you to stay on top of any mistakes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demonstrating responsible management of your business credit will help provide your business with more options, from availability of financing to favorable loan terms to access to suppliers and vendors. Simply put, building strong business credit is a key factor in establishing and growing your successful small business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
