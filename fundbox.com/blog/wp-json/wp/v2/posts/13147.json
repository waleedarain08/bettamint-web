With the <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/covid-19-business-update\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coronavirus<\/a> spreading quickly, by late March, 2020 the Texas state government mandated shelter-in-place. This meant he couldn\u2019t work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Challenge:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With no clear timeline as to when the economy would reopen, he started looking at his options. Through his realtor association he heard about the CARES Act and the new <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-ppp-lenders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)<\/a>, which aims to support small businesses with employees and independent contractors and sole proprietors like him. He was excited at the possibility of relief funds to help pay the bills while he waited for the state government to lift the quarantine regulations. However, soon after the government released the guidelines for applying as a sole proprietor on April 10 the first round of funding ran out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Solution:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the time the second round of funding was announced, Donald received an email from Fundbox, offering information in order to help him apply for PPP funds. He had an open line of credit with Fundbox so he was familiar with the service. He clicked to apply and filled out some basic details. Then Fundbox connected him with partner Cross River Bank to submit the application to the SBA. \u201cThe entire process was really easy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest, I thought it was going to be a lot worse.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within a few days, he had heard back from Cross River and was approved. He signed the loan documents and a day or two after that the money arrived.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Results:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m going to use at least 75% of the money mostly for payroll, to pay myself. With the rest I\u2019ll pay utilities and my share of the office rent.\u201d Concerned about qualifying for forgiveness, he hired ADP to run payroll for him. \u201cI opened the ADP account so I can clearly keep track of exactly how much I\u2019m paying myself each pay period.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: Eligibility for PPP loans may vary based on your specific business, and the lender you apply with.
