Your business credit score\u2014which is based on your company\u2019s history of debt, payments, and credit\u2014is a marker of your creditworthiness. Your score essentially tells lenders, vendors, and credit card companies how reliable you are with paying bills and making debt repayments on time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better your business credit score, the more likely you are to get approved for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/use-first-business-loan-effectively\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that have favorable terms. Think: lower interest rates, larger lines of credit, or longer repayment terms. A healthy business score can also give you more leverage when negotiating insurance premiums or discussing payment terms with suppliers and landlords.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t have a business credit score yet, take the following steps to start establishing business credit in your company\u2019s name:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business structure<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that separates your personal and business finances, such as an LLC or corporation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply for an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employer identification number<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (EIN).\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/best-banks-for-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business bank account<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal credit vs. business credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A personal credit score is based on your personal credit history, including the amount of debt you have and how many credit cards you\u2019ve opened. Personal credit scores are rated on a scale of 300 to 800, while business credit scores fall between 0 and 100. So, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is a good credit score<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? For personal scores, 700 or higher is considered good; for business credit, most credit bureaus consider 80 or higher to be good.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some lenders check personal credit scores when reviewing business loan applications, but most prefer to evaluate business credit scores instead. However, if you don\u2019t have business credit\u2014either because your business is new or you\u2019re operating as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/self-employed-ppp-loan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sole proprietor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014lenders will rely on your personal credit history to assess your creditworthiness.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to improve your business credit score<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There isn\u2019t one foolproof method for improving your business credit score, but certain strategies can help. If you want to raise your business credit score, try these five tactics:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Update your information with business credit bureaus<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three main commercial credit bureaus that collect your credit information and create your business credit scores: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dnb.com\/resources\/db-credit-scores-ratings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dun &amp; Bradstreet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.equifax.com\/business\/business-credit-reports-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equifax<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/small-business\/small-business-credit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experian<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Not only do all three bureaus have slightly different formulas for creating business credit scores, lenders and suppliers also report credit information to different bureaus. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to update your credit file with all three bureaus instead of just one.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by visiting each credit bureau\u2019s website and reviewing their guidelines for establishing or maintaining business credit. From there, you can review your file, upload recent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial statements<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or check your business credit report for errors and inaccuracies. If you spot any issues, report them to the credit bureau immediately. Keeping your credit file clean, accurate, and up to date is key to improving your score.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Pay your bills on time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making timely payments to lenders, vendors, utility companies, and landlords is one of the easiest ways to increase your credit score.You may have to shuffle your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-tips-for-boosting-your-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to beat the due dates, but getting ahead of your payments\u2014even by one or two days\u2014can raise your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few tips to ensure you make payments on time:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Track your accounts payable in a spreadsheet.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set up automatic online payments for recurring costs, like utilities bills and monthly debt repayments.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">File invoices as soon as you receive them and set calendar reminders to pay your bills when they\u2019re due.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Block off one day a week to pay bills manually.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Maintain a low credit utilization ratio<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A credit utilization ratio is the amount of credit you\u2019ve used compared to the amount of credit you have available. Credit reporting agencies typically value lower credit utilization ratios, since it means you\u2019re not maxing out your available credit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good ratio is 30%, but an excellent ratio is around 10%. Let\u2019s say you have a $20,000 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/business-line-of-credit-comparison\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business line of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To achieve a 30% credit utilization ratio, you need to use no more than $6,000 at a time before bringing your balance back to zero.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try these strategies to lower your credit utilization ratio:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Bring your balances as close to zero as possible.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When you regularly pay off your balances, your credit utilization ratio drops.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Make micropayments throughout the month. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of paying just once a month, try making multiple smaller payments throughout the month to ensure your balance doesn\u2019t get too high.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Increase your credit limit. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call your credit card company or credit issuer to ask for a higher limit. When you increase your limit without increasing your balance, your credit utilization ratio decreases.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Open a new line of credit.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you open another line of credit and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t use it<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll have more total available credit, which will lower your ratio.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Open a new business credit card<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a second or third <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/best-business-credit-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business credit card<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help improve your business credit score\u2014as long as you stay on top of your spending and monthly payments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick is to apply for a business credit card that reports to one of the three major commercial credit bureaus. To find out if your credit card issuer sends its information to a credit agency, scour their website FAQs or call customer service for more information. You can also see a list of major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/blog\/which-credit-cards-can-help-me-build-business-credit-25633\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit card issuers that report to credit bureaus here<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get your new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business credit card<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, come up with a strategy for how you\u2019ll use it. One option is to designate your card for specific business expenses, like office supplies or fuel for your delivery trucks. That way, you can easily control your monthly spending and schedule regular payments to keep your balance low.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Add trade references to your credit file<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many credit bureaus use trade references to get a glimpse into your payment history with vendors and suppliers. Trade references are based on a handful of factors, like the manner of payment, the current amount you owe, and the current amount (if any) that\u2019s past due. Positive trade references help boost your business credit score.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you work with a handful of different vendors to buy supplies or materials for your business, ask them to report your payments to a business credit bureau. As long as you abide by the terms of your trade agreement\u2014like paying <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/welcome-new-net-terms-economy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">within 30 or 60 days<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after receiving your goods\u2014your trade references should be positive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your vendors don\u2019t want to report to a credit bureau, you can still list them as a trade reference on your credit bureau accounts. The credit bureaus you report to will then follow up to gather your payment information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building better business credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether your business is new or more established, it\u2019s crucial to work on improving your business credit score.
