Instead of giving up on the idea, Johnson got creative. She knew that parents would be bringing their kids back for classes in the fall and wondered whether she could borrow against those future revenues.<\/p>\n<p>This was the genesis of merchant cash advances (MCAs), a form of small business financing that enables companies to put their future credit card receipts to use today. Today, MCAs are typically used by companies that process high volumes of credit card transactions.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bryantparkcapital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/MCA-SMB-Insert.jpg\">recent report<\/a><\/span>, the market for small business MCAs that hauled in $8.6 billion in 2014 was expected to grow to $15.3 billion in 2017, with no sign of slowing down. This is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not<\/span>\u00a0because MCAs are the \u201cbest\u201d financial products for small businesses, though. Since the 2007\u20132008 financial collapse, banks have been <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/big-banks-cut-back-on-small-business-1448586637\">less and less inclined<\/a><\/span>\u00a0to lend money to small businesses. Yet a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/profit-margins-and-cash-flow\/\">majority of small business owners<\/a><\/span>\u00a0deal with cash flow challenges each year. Instead of turning to banks, these business owners were forced to look for other options. Many of them turned to MCAs because they are a quick and easy form of financing.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean they are the best option for your business? To help answer that question, let\u2019s assess the pros and cons of this type of small business financing.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro #1: Fast funding<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Merchant cash advances are one of the fastest forms of small business financing available. The application process is a cinch; you usually just need to submit a few months\u2019 worth of credit card and bank statements. If you apply online and are approved, money can be in your business\u2019 bank account in as fast as 24 to 48 hours.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro #2: No fixed monthly installments<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Small business owners who take out MCAs repay lenders by giving them a fixed percentage of credit card receipts each month (e.g., 10%). You won\u2019t have to worry about being unable to repay an installment in the event sales are slower than expected because lenders take a fixed percentage of your receipts no matter how high or low they are.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro #3: You can qualify even if you have bad credit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Securing a traditional small business loan from a bank usually requires having a near-perfect credit score. MCAs offer no such stipulations. Lenders are more interested in the future of the borrower\u2019s business\u2014not the past.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro #4: You don\u2019t have to put up any collateral<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Some small business financing options require borrowers to put up collateral (e.g., property or equipment) in order to secure funding. In the event the borrower is unable to repay the loan, the lender can recoup their costs by selling the collateral. MCAs enable small business owners to finance their operations without worrying about losing their property in the event things take a turn for the worse.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pro #5: The amount you owe never grows<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re approved for a merchant cash advance, you\u2019ll need to repay the loan plus the factor fee the lender charges. You\u2019ll know up front precisely how much money you will need to pay back in order to settle your account. With MCAs, there\u2019s no such thing as late fees and interest never accrues.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Con #1: One of the most expensive forms of small business financing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Merchant cash advances are quite expensive. In fact, according to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/small-business-special-report-mca\/\">one estimate<\/a><\/span>, MCAs can have annual percentage rates (APRs) as high as 350%. Business owners that go this route are pursuing one of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/12\/01\/news\/economy\/merchant-cash-advance\/index.html\">costliest forms<\/a><\/span>\u00a0of financing.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Con #2: It\u2019s a temporary solution to business problems<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While MCAs can certainly help some small business owners solve temporary cash shortages, it\u2019s not a long-term solution. How can you expect your business to get to the next level when someone\u2019s eating into your profits every single day?<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Con #3: Funds get deduction daily, hurting your cash flow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many MCA lenders deduct funds from your credit card receipts on a daily basis. If you need small business financing because you\u2019re experiencing cash flow problems, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to borrow from a lender that is eating into your revenue every day.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Con #4: Lenders operate in an unregulated industry<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Merchant cash advance lenders operate in a largely unregulated market, which enables them to charge hefty interest fees. Some <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/in-depth\/2016\/how-long-can-mcas-avoid-the-loan-label\/\">industry analysts<\/a><\/span>, however, believe that it\u2019s only a matter of time before MCAs become regulated. In any event, since they\u2019re currently unregulated, there\u2019s no one looking out to make sure borrowers are getting a fair deal.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Con #5: You may lose some control over your business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Some MCA providers will only lend money to businesses if they agree to operate under <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unitedcapitalsource.com\/blog\/10-pros-and-6-cons-of-merchant-cash-advances-for-small-businesses\/\">certain guidelines<\/a><\/span>. For example, they may not allow borrowers to encourage their customers to pay in cash. They might not also allow you to close your doors for an extended period of time (e.g., take a month-long vacation) until the loan is repaid.<\/p>\n<p>If your business processes a lot of credit card transactions and you need a temporary financing solution that you\u2019re willing to pay a lot of money for, a merchant cash advance may be right for you. If, on the other hand, MCAs sound more damaging than helpful, you\u2019re not out of options.
