Business partners enjoy the benefits of shared expertise, shared roles and shared success. But there\u2019s also shared risk and, as in all human relationships, the potential for conflict.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you marry these pros and cons and enjoy a fruitful partnership, that isn\u2019t prone to constant friction? Here are some ideas to consider:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Settle on Goals<\/strong><br \/>\nBefore you get locked into a partnership, make sure you have a good idea of who you\u2019re getting into business with. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you\u2019ve known or worked with this person before, are your goals similar? If one partner is looking to turn their hobby into a passion and enjoy a better work\/life balance, while the other wants to pour every hour into creating a multi-million dollar enterprise, then you may be looking at problems down the road.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Have Clearly Defined Roles<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the great things about partnerships is that each partner brings different skills and experience to the table. It\u2019s a good idea to work these distinctions into your job roles. Instead of thinking of yourselves as sharing equal duties, approach your business as any employee-based organization would and assign roles and responsibilities. Perhaps one partner handles operations (employees, payroll, accounting, etc.) while the other is in charge of sales and marketing. If you\u2019re both doing the same thing then you\u2019ll tread on each other\u2019s toes and create opportunities for conflict.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Don\u2019t Be Afraid of Confrontation<\/strong><br \/>\nConfrontation can be just as healthy for a business partnership as it is for a marriage. Don\u2019t shy away from it. Saying what\u2019s on your mind (I\u2019m not advocating antagonism here) or calling a partner out on a decision or action, shows that you are both invested in its success. If you can\u2019t tell your business partner how you feel, you can you make the partnership work?<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Communicate and Motivate<\/strong><br \/>\nCommunication is key to teamwork. Whether you\u2019re a head chef in charge of a busy kitchen or a football coach driving his team on, without communication nothing gets done. So make a point of communicating, or over-communicating, as much as you can. Have regular meetings, check-ins, and problem-solving discussions. Humans thrive on communication and running a business can be a lonely process, so take advantage of your partnership and motivate and excite each other at every opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Address Conflict ASAP<\/strong><br \/>\nSpeaking of communication, as conflict arises, and it will, make a point of dealing with it ASAP. Don\u2019t let it linger. Discuss it, come to a resolution, and redirect your energies back into your business. It\u2019s a good idea to come up with a formal resolution process early in the partnership.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Enjoy Your Time Apart!<\/strong><br \/>\nMake a point of spending time away from each other. Have a separate life outside the office. You don\u2019t have to be best friends. Your own social network of friends and family can provide relief and a new perspective on things.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Agree How You\u2019ll Split Profits<\/strong><br \/>\nHow are you going to split your profits? How you do it is up to you (and it doesn\u2019t have to be equal), but whatever you decide put it in writing (more on this below). Read my earlier tips on <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership\/\">How to Split Profits in a Small Business Partnership.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Put Everything in Writing<\/strong><br \/>\nEverything, from profit-sharing, to roles and responsibilities, contributions to the partnership (such as the assets you both bring to the table), decision-making (the scope of each partner\u2019s authority to make decisions), how the partnership will be dissolved, and so on should be written up in a partnership agreement. Work with your lawyer and accountant to formalize the agreement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Learn to Compromise<\/strong><br \/>\nAnother lesson we can learn from marriage \u2013 compromise. Accept that it\u2019s not all going to go your way and you\u2019re not going to agree on everything. As long as the business stays on course, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Give It Time<\/strong><br \/>\nAll of the above points, aside from the contractual stuff, will take time. For example, as your partnership and business skills mature your roles and responsibilities may change, so keep an open mind on that front. Likewise, it takes time to get to know each other\u2019s style of working, hot buttons, how you deal with stress (which invariably follows when money problems arise) and get to a place where you\u2019re really comfortable with each other.<\/p>\n<p>For more tips on finding a happy equilibrium with your business partner read, <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership\/\">8 Questions to Ask Before Entering into a Business Partnership.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Successful business partnerships are an incredible testament to character, communication and well, let\u2019s face it, fortitude.
