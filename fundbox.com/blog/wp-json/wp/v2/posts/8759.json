Enabled by technology and spurred by the diversified income sources that having many clients brings, freelancing is increasingly becoming the career of choice.<\/p>\n<p>But freelancing isn\u2019t easy. As a freelancer or small business owner, you must also be prepared for challenges like finding new clients, managing those relationships and delivering great work. It\u2019s a busy schedule and the last thing you want to worry about are administrative and accounting tasks like tracking time and expenses, billing clients, and collecting payments \u2013 all of which are highly manual tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, these tasks don\u2019t have to take up the bulk of your day, if you take advantage of automation.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four ways to automate away some of the complexity of your freelance or small business invoicing and payment workflows, while making sure you stay cash-flow-positive.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1.<\/span>\u00a0 <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Use Time Tracking Software<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Keeping track of time as a freelancer isn\u2019t easy. One minute you\u2019re on the phone to a client, the next you\u2019re attending to urgent emails, all while trying to crank through a time-sensitive project. Forgetting to record 30 minutes here or an hour there can reduce your billings. Doing it manually could also mean you overlook project creep.<\/p>\n<p>One of the basic forms of automation that can help streamline your workflows is to use time tracking software. Free and low-cost apps can help you understand how much time you spend on a project, identify scope creep (so you can step back and re-prioritize activities with your client), and simplify billing.<\/p>\n<p>Many time tracking tools and apps also include automatic invoice generation based on your tracked time \u2013 which eliminates time-consuming tracking across spreadsheets and the potential for \u00a0billing errors. Tools and apps to consider include<a href=\"https:\/\/www.and.co\/time-tracking\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.and.co\/time-tracking\">AND CO<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.getharvest.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getharvest.com\/\">Harvest<\/a><\/span>\u00a0(both of which integrate with invoicing workflows),<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebillity.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebillity.com\/\">eBillity<\/a><\/span>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/timelyapp.com\/\">Timely<\/a><\/span>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toptal.com\/tracker\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toptal.com\/tracker\/\">TopTracker<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2.<\/span>\u00a0 <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Automate your Expenses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A key learning moment for any new freelancer is that money doesn\u2019t take care of itself. If you\u2019re to protect yourself in the event of an IRS audit and claim the right deductions you need to wrap your arms around your expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Managing your expenses in a spreadsheet is ok, but as your business grows, maintaining a paper trail can become a headache. This is especially true of freelancers whose expenses are small, yet quickly add up. These small costs often get forgotten or recorded without the necessary backup information that the IRS requires such as date, business purpose, mileage logs, a copy of receipts, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Several low-cost tools and apps can help streamline expense tracking so that everything is in one place at tax time.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.expensify.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.expensify.com\/\">Expensify<\/a><\/span>\u00a0is a popular choice that takes most of the hassle out of the process by allowing you to snap a picture of a receipt and then upload it to an Expensify account. The app fills in the expense details, attaches the receipt to the associated credit card account, and imports the information to your accounting program.<\/p>\n<p>Other expense management tools include<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shoeboxed.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shoeboxed.com\/\">Shoeboxed<\/a><\/span>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.zoho.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zoho.com\/\">Zoho<\/a><\/span>, and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.certify.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.certify.com\/\">Certify<\/a><\/span>. However, if you\u2019re looking for an end-to-end solution for integrating expense tracking and management with all your accounting needs, take a look at more robust accounting software like<a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">FreshBooks<\/a><\/span>,<a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\">QuickBooks<\/a><\/span>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/\">\u00a0<\/a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/\">Xero<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3.<\/span>\u00a0 <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Move to Online Billing and Payments<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Collecting payment is a perpetual challenge for freelancers and small business owners.
