Loans enable you to make purchases for your business, hire team members, and cover your everyday expenses as you scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securing a loan isn\u2019t always straightforward and the process can be time-consuming, especially if you choose a traditional lender like a bank. In this article, we\u2019ll share some of the processes and requirements for most loan applications so that you can get a better idea of what goes into applying for a business loan before you get started.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get your business ready for a loan\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing to do before you apply for a loan is to determine exactly how you\u2019ll use the funds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need financing right away to cover immediate expenses like payroll or rent, you\u2019ll need to look for a loan option that offers a quick approval process and more <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flexible business credit.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for a large sum to invest in your first piece of equipment, you might want to look for loans that use that purchase as collateral if you do not have any other assets yet. Many lenders need you to detail how you\u2019ll use the loan, so this step will help you build your case going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next thing to take a look at is your business\u2019s current financial position. Ensure that your business and personal finances are clearly separated to get a full picture of how the business is doing. Lenders will be looking into your financial history and your past and projected sales as part of the approval process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check both your personal and business <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-loans\/guides\/credit-score-for-business-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit scores<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from reporting agencies like Dun &amp; Bradstreet, TransUnion, and Equifax. Pay down your current debt, including balances on your business and personal credit cards. Using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.experian.com\/blogs\/ask-experian\/what-is-the-best-percentile-for-credit-utilization\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 to 30 percent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your credit can help boost your credit score. Making sure that you\u2019re in good financial standing with your suppliers and catching up on past-due accounts can also help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-hacks-building-business-credit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quickly boost your credit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your creditworthiness affects whether you\u2019ll be approved for the loan, but keep in mind that it also affects the annual percentage rate (APR) you\u2019ll pay on the loan. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/late-payment-credit-score\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">better your credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the lower your interest rates will be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand the application process\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the factors you should look at before applying for a loan is the application process itself. Depending on the lender, you could be spending more time and resources than you bargained for preparing an application and waiting for approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional bank loans and loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) typically have the most involved application processes and you might have to wait for a credit decision. Loans from online lenders tend to have applications you can complete in minutes to receive a fast credit decision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for a bank loan<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank loans aren\u2019t always the best option for small businesses, in part because the application process is so rigorous. Banks can offer the best APR to businesses with a credit score of 750 or higher, a strong history of revenue, and several years in operation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can still qualify for bank loans with a score between 700-749, but you\u2019ll need to build a good case for your business. Part of the application process is presenting a business plan and detailing how the funds will be used.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks also require you to provide information like sales, sales projections, expenses, and cash flow. They need to be sure your cash flow will accommodate regular payments on the loan.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for an SBA-backed loan<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA loans \u2014 including the SBA 7(a) loan, CDC\/504 loan, and microloans \u2014 are provided through banks and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). The SBA provides some guidelines and requirements for these loans, but lenders also have their own eligibility requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To apply for an SBA loan, you\u2019ll need to have a credit score of at least 680 and provide thorough documentation that includes your business tax returns, profit and loss statement, loan application history, business licenses and registration, and the resumes of your principal leadership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be aware that the SBA loan application process can take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.merchantmaverick.com\/sba-loan-approval-time\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from 30 to 90 days<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depending on the loan you\u2019re applying for and the lender you choose. SBA Preferred Lenders can process applications faster, but expect to wait a month at minimum for approval. The best way to speed up the approval process is to have all of your documentation in order.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applying for loan from an online lender<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many online lenders and fintech platforms offer term loans as well as lines of credit, merchant cash advances, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/invoice-factoring\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and financing. One of the benefits of online platforms is that the application process is significantly quicker and simpler than applying for a loan from a traditional lender.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Fundbox\u2019s application process requires you to answer a few questions about your business and connect your business checking account and accounting software. A credit decision is made in as little as three minutes, and you can receive funds in your account within three business days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to credit score requirements, most online lenders, including Fundbox, look for scores above 600. Some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and merchant cash advance providers will not take your credit score into account at all, but you\u2019ll be on the hook for a steeper APR.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assess the costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, as you shop around for loan options, keep in mind that taking on debt will cost you. Advertised interest rates likely will not reflect your APR, which includes additional charges like origination fees and ongoing service fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing exactly how you\u2019ll use your loan will come in handy when you\u2019re deciding how much money you\u2019d like. Choosing the loan amount that fits your needs can save you money in the future. Many lenders charge prepayment fees, which means that even if you do not use the full loan amount, you have to continue to repay on a regular basis for the remainder of your repayment term if you want to avoid this penalty.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not a direct cost to you, bear in mind that secured loans require collateral. Equipment loans or mortgages use the property itself as collateral while loans for other purchases are usually secured with a UCC-1 or \u201cblanket\u201d lien, which uses all your business assets as collateral. It can be extremely costly to replace your assets if they are repossessed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some loans, including SBA loans, also require a personal guarantee, which means that personal assets are used as collateral, too. Unsecured loans do not require collateral, but you\u2019ll pay much higher interest rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to apply for a business loan?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox offers term loans and lines of credit up to $150,000* for small businesses that need funding quickly.
