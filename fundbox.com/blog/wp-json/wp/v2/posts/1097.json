To help you navigate what\u2019s new, here\u2019s a breakdown of five big changes that you should know about before you file your 2014 return.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Claim Your 2014 Business Mileage<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you drove anywhere for business, whether it was to the airport for a business trip or to Office Depot to purchase printer ink, don\u2019t forget to log that mileage and file it as an expense on your return. The IRS mileage rate for the 2014 tax year was 56 cents per mile (a slight decrease from last year).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take Advantage of the Simplified Home Office Deduction<\/strong><br \/>\nIn 2013, the IRS was kind to home-based businesses. In a bid to save more than 1.6 million hours in tax preparation and provide qualifying home office dwellers with a deduction of up to $1,500 per year (that\u2019s $5 per square foot) the IRS simplified the process of calculating the home office tax deduction.<\/p>\n<p>This simplified deduction also applies in 2014. Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n<p>Home businesses can either use the regular method of calculating the deduction whereby you track actual expense such as utilities, mortgage, etc. and calculate your deduction based on the percentage of your home devoted to business. Or, you can use the simplified version and claim $5 per square feet up to a maximum of $300 square feet of home office space. If your office is over 300 square feet, then you\u2019d need to go the traditional method.

Here\u2019s what you need to know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section 179 (which lets you expense the entire cost of equipment purchases in the year you bought them rather than depreciating the cost) will experience a whopping cut from $500,000 to $25,000 in 2015 if Congress fails to take action to extend the threshold. The good news is that if you purchased equipment in 2014 you can still claim up to the $500,000 threshold with this year\u2019s filing.<\/li>\n<li>If you hired veterans in the past, note that the work opportunity tax credit that allowed businesses to claim a credit up to $9,600 for hiring veterans and other workers has gone.<\/li>\n<li>Another tax credit to fall by the wayside is the energy tax incentive that encouraged green business investments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tax Brackets have Increased<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you report federal taxes as a pass-through entity (partnership, S Corporation and LLCs) or operate a sole proprietorship your federal income tax bracket likely experienced an increase in 2013. This increase, a result of big changes in federal income tax brackets for individuals, is around for 2014 too.<\/p>\n<p>By way of example, the tax rate for single filers making between $9,076 and $36,900 is now 15%. If you make between $89,351 and $186,350 the rate is 28%.

If you had health care coverage in 2014, easy \u2013 just tick a box on your return and move on to the next section.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you didn\u2019t have coverage you\u2019ll face a penalty. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/fees-exemptions\/fee-for-not-being-covered\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Healthcare.gov<\/a>, you\u2019ll pay the\u00a0higher\u00a0of these two amounts when you file your 2014 federal tax return:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1% of your yearly household income<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>$95 per person for the year ($47.50 per child under 18)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s another scenario. If you did sign up for Obamacare through a marketplace in 2014 you\u2019ll need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/taxes\/marketplace-health-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">complete the new Form 1095-A<\/a> which should have been sent to you in the mail in early February. Why?<\/p>\n<p>When you applied for health coverage through the marketplace, you provided an estimate of your 2014 income and other information. The marketplace used this information to determine a premium tax credit you were eligible for. Form 1095-A helps the IRS determine whether you have received the right credit on your monthly premiums, if you\u2019re subject to a penalty, and whether you can claim an exemption. All a bit confusing!
