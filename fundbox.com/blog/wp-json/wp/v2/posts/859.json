But before the fear of losing new business kicks in and you agree to slash your rate, take a deep breath and carefully consider your response and negotiation tactics.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few options for dealing with this kind of situation:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Be Ready to Explain Your Value (i.e. You Get What You Pay For)<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s always worth having an elevator pitch on hand to justify your rate and explain the value you bring.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to be particularly slick about it either. Just roll off the top three or four things that you do well and that differentiate you from everyone else. For example:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<i>I don\u2019t just deliver on-time, I always deliver ahead of schedule. My work rarely requires re-working \u2013 saving you time and money. And, my experience in this field is unmatched<\/i>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Throw in a few examples or client references (in a comparable industry) to back up your statement. Don\u2019t just name drop, but show how you actually helped those clients do X, Y, or Z.<\/p>\n<p>If you can prove the meat behind your rate, clients often loosen up the purse strings because they can start to see how you can help them. Remember, your client is taking a risk too. Help ease their concern by showing that you are experienced, reputable and a good value!<\/p>\n<p>If you still can\u2019t convince them that you\u2019re worth it,\u00a0they\u2019ll likely never value you and the negotiation needs to end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Work Within Their Budget<\/strong><br \/>\nIf the client still won\u2019t pay\u00a0your rate, tell them what you can do within their budget or offer them a cheaper option. For example,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c<i>The rate I quoted includes X, Y, and Z but I can do Z and Y at a lower rate, and you could take care of Z yourself or I can complete it when more budget becomes available<\/i>.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This gives you a chance to prove your value. If they find more money down the line or need help with smaller projects, then they\u2019ll hopefully use you again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Try to Negotiate a Commitment<\/strong><br \/>\nAnother option is to negotiate a commitment on future projects in exchange for a lower rate.<\/p>\n<p>But be careful here. We\u2019ve all come across clients who promise more work in exchange for a lower rate only to find that work never materializes. Dig deep and ask what type of projects they can send your way. Is budget approved? What is the scope of the projects? These types of questions will help you gauge whether there is something there or not.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, what does your gut tell you about the client? Have you been trying to secure them for a while? \u00a0If you already have a prospecting relationship with them and sense good vibes, agreeing to a lower rate might make sense \u2013 if they can commit to sending more work your way.<\/p>\n<p>To nail that commitment, try to get them to agree to a contract that states that future projects, even if they are only loosely defined, are included in the agreement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Know When It\u2019s Time to Say \u201cNo Way!\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\nTurning down work is a fact of life, no one wants to be stuck with a client who doesn\u2019t perceive your true value or puts you in a position where you feel taken advantage of.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of when it might be time to stop negotiating and walk away:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>When the Rate is Way Off<\/b> \u2013 If your average hourly rate is $80 but the client will only pay $50, you might be better off pursuing clients who can pay you what you&#8217;re worth. Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb \u2013 if the client offers one-third of what you usually charge, walk away.<\/li>\n<li><b>The Promise of More Work <\/b>\u2013 This is probably the most common tactic used by clients and plays right into a small business owner\u2019s Achilles heel. Be cautious about going there; invariably the promise of more work is just a ruse. \u00a0If you do go there, refer to my previous point above about securing that promise of more work in contract form.<\/li>\n<li><b>\u201cYou\u2019ll Get Great Exposure\u201d<\/b> \u2013 Another tactic that rarely bears fruit.<\/li>\n<li><b>Attitude<\/b> \u2013 If a prospective client rejects your rate and does so with attitude, spare yourself future hassles and walk away from a relationship that already feels wrong.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We\u2019ve all come\u00a0across these scenarios, and while you don\u2019t want to turn down a client at the first hurdle, heed the warning signs and play it carefully before agreeing to lower your rate. If you do decide to walk, send them a courtesy email thanking them for their consideration and let them know that you\u2019re probably not the right person for the job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><br \/>\nRemember, any rejection of your fee is a negotiation. Be professional and try to find out what the real issue at play is, and offer creative solutions that make sense for both of you. If it really does come down to price, then accept that you\u2019re just not the right fit, and remember \u2013 it\u2019s not personal.<strong> \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cSorry, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re used to paying\u201d \u201cOur budget won\u2019t stretch to that amount\u201d \u201cSorry, we typically pay $X &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3160,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[11547],"yst_prominent_words":[844,1248,773,4349,4351,3037,3734,4350,4355,3040,2290,4354,4348,4234,3511,2074,4353,3090,4085,4352],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"When a Client Won&#039;t Pay What You&#039;re Worth - Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Ever had a client who won&#039;t pay your fee.
