Firing off an invoice the second a project wraps up may seem desperate and unprofessional. Waiting politely for weeks could interrupt your cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>So when is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/timing-invoices\">the best time to invoice<\/a><\/span>? Like most important decisions, the answer is: That depends on the client and the type of work you do.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few common scenarios:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invoice upon purchase<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you provide goods like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/indosole-uses-fundbox-save-environment-one-shoe-time\/\">handmade shoes<\/a><\/span>\u00a0or services like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-ozglo-uses-fundbox-to-manage-cash-flow-crunches\/\">cleaning<\/a><\/span>, you\u2019re not likely to send your customer an invoice by email or post\u2014you\u2019ll expect payment on the spot. And they\u2019ll be prepared to pay you in cash, by check, debit or credit card.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invoice upon project completion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re providing tech services or are a consultant or writer, you\u2019re probably working with B2B clients on projects that may take anywhere from a few hours to a few months. While it may be tempting to invoice the second you submit your work, it\u2019s best to wait at least a few days. There may be questions, feedback or revisions to make. Let the project come to a natural conclusion before sending an invoice.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invoice at pre-determined milestones<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re working on a large-scale, long-term project, it\u2019s smart to negotiate payments at pre-determined milestones. This will allow you to purchase any necessary materials and ensure you have adequate cash flow while a portion of your time is tied up with one project. The key is to clearly define the project stage or date for each invoice.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invoice weekly, bi-weekly or monthly<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Do you have clients who call on you for hourly project work off and on all the time? Ideally, they\u2019re paying you a retainer\u2014a pre-defined amount of money every month to reserve your time. If not, preserve your cash flow and invoice regularly. Weekly is best, bi-weekly is okay and monthly is a last resort and usually reserved for larger companies who don\u2019t want to process multiple payments every month.<\/p>\n<p>Timing may be important when it comes to invoicing, but it\u2019s not everything. Your payment terms go a long way to getting paid as quickly as possible. The number of days your clients have to pay after you submit your invoice will vary depending on your business and the type of customer. Common payment terms include:<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pre-payments and deposits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If your customers are B2C, start-ups or businesses that have a history of late payments, there\u2019s nothing wrong with requesting payment up front, or at least a deposit before you begin work.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7 to 10 days<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just a few years ago it was unheard of to request a payment in under 30 days. But credit cards, PayPal, WePay and other e-forms of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/faster-payments-clients\">payment<\/a><\/span>\u00a0have made settling up easier than ever. You\u2019re probably not going to get the big company with a robust payroll department on board with one-week payment terms, but there\u2019s no reason not to try with smaller businesses.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">30 days<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>By far the most common payment terms for small businesses, a month seems reasonable for payer and payee. It gives commercial customers time to get their paperwork sorted out and shouldn\u2019t impede your cash flow too much.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">40-60 days<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not recommended to have payment terms of more than 30 days \u2013 but sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable when working with companies with rigid accounts payable policies. The silver lining is that these organizations usually pay on the higher scale. If they don\u2019t, reconsider working with them.<\/p>\n<p>Although how quickly a client pays up may be somewhat out of your control, there are a lot of little things you can do to encourage quicker payment, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Use <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">accounting software<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0to create and track invoices. <\/span>A professional-looking invoice that features your logo, the units of hours\/good, hourly or flat rate and payment terms is critical for all small businesses. A good system will help you churn out invoices faster and keep track of them for you, so you always know exactly how many days till a payment is due.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Discuss <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\">payment terms<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0before you start. <\/span>Your clients should know exactly what they owe (or at least a very close estimate) before they open your invoice \u2013 including when it\u2019s due.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Offer online payment. <\/span>It\u2019s more convenient for your customers and helps you get paid faster. Most accounting software allows you to accept credit cards, PayPal, e-transfer and other online methods of payment.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Automate<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0late payment reminders. <\/span>Another good reason to use formal accounting software \u2013 it\u2019ll do your \u201cdirty\u201d work for you, including following up with tardy clients. Simply set your payment terms, write a template and get down to other business. It\u2019ll know when to blast an email reminder.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Charge <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">late fees<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">. <\/span>Sometimes the best way to motivate clients who are slow to pay is to levy a surcharge for late payments. A simple 1-2% usually does the trick. Be sure to build it into your invoice with clear payment terms, including the date when late fees will be applied.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Invoice regularly. <\/span>You can\u2019t blame clients for cash flow problems if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s late to invoice. Yes, invoicing is kind of a hassle, but it\u2019s important to stay on it. The sooner you do it, the faster you get paid.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Be polite. <\/span>According to FreshBooks research, being polite matters. A lot. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/invoice-payment-terms\">A simple \u201cplease pay your invoice within\u201d or \u201cthank you for your business\u201d can increase the percentage of invoices that are paid by more than 5 per cent<\/a><\/span>. Incorporate the magic words into your invoice and make more money.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to knowing when to invoice and what kind of payment terms to demand, there are no right or wrong answers. Know your clients, trust your instincts and be prepared to negotiate and be flexible in different situations.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This guest post was written by Heather Hudson of FreshBooks for Fundbox. <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">FreshBooks<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0makes invoicing and accounting painless for millions of small business owners. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to invoicing, small business owners don\u2019t have it easy.
