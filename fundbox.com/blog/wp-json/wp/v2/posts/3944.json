In fact, according to data from Ascend2 and Dun &amp; Bradstreet NetProspex&#8217;s report \u201cEmail Marketing Trends\u2014B2B Benchmarks for 2015,\u201d B2B businesses use email to boost engagement (62 percent), generate leads (57 percent), improve customer acquisition and retention (43 percent), and nurture leads (42 percent). When asked if they believe email marketing will help them achieve these objectives, a whopping 91 percent of respondents say it can. That\u2019s a lot of confidence and obviously means email marketing is working for these businesses. But how does your email marketing success compare to theirs?<\/p>\n<p>When measuring email marketing success, most marketers look at a few key metrics: Seventy-three percent of survey respondents consider the click-through rate the most useful metric to determine success. Conversion rate comes in a close second at 71 percent. And although open rate and email ROI\u2014the next top contenders\u2014lag behind at 42 percent and 40 percent respectively, ROI is important to understanding an email campaign\u2019s performance so you can better understand your customers and increase your sales.<\/p>\n<p>You can calculate your email marketing ROI by gathering a few numbers and entering them into this online <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emailmarketingroi.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email marketing ROI calculator<\/a>. You\u2019ll need to know:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The type of calculation you want to solve: whether by time period (month or year) or by email campaign.<\/li>\n<li>Your email volume (the number of emails that were actually sent, not bounced addresses)<\/li>\n<li>Your open, click and conversion rates<\/li>\n<li>The net conversion value.\u00a0This is the monetary value that an average conversion adds to your email campaign profit, and is also called <em>contribution margin<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>The total costs (all the costs involved in your email marketing campaigns)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to benchmark your success against other companies\u2019 campaigns unless you know your competitors\u2019 key metrics. MailChimp recently released its <a href=\"http:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/research\/email-marketing-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Average Email Campaign Stats of MailChimp Customers by Industry<\/a> (or you can check by company size).<\/p>\n<p>To increase your numbers, here are some tips to follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to Salesforce\u2019s\u00a02015 State of Marketing report, 66 percent of emails are opened on a mobile device\u2014so make sure your email is readable across all types of mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li>The first step to getting your email opened is getting past the spam filters. Avoid spammy keywords and phrases such as \u201cClearance\u201d and \u201cLowest price.\u201d When it comes to subject lines, don\u2019t\u00a0<em>sell\u00a0<\/em>what\u2019s inside; instead <em>tell\u00a0<\/em>what engaging content the recipient will get to read.<\/li>\n<li>If your analytics show recipients think your email is spam it means they don\u2019t remember your company. Make sure the \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cSubject\u201d lines contain your company name.<\/li>\n<li>Know your audience. B2B email recipients don\u2019t want a sales pitch. They want to be informed about options, read helpful or entertaining content, or learn about real-life solutions. Use \u201cmore info\u201d as your call to action, instead of \u201cbuy now.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>In the B2B sales process, there are usually many channels of approval to go through, so make sure your email isn\u2019t too geared towards one decision maker. For example, touch on the technical advantages of your product or service, but don\u2019t get so techy that you turn off other readers who might not understand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No one can deny email marketing is still a crucial part of every business\u2019s marketing strategy.
