Here are a few advantages to online accounting software:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Cost savings<\/b>. Avoid the costs associated with expensive business accounting software (cloud-based systems range from $0 to $40 per month depending on your needs and number of users).<\/li>\n<li><b>Reduced complexity<\/b>.\u00a0 Small business cloud accounting software is specifically designed with simplicity of use in mind and is a great fit for business owners with little or no experience, as well as more seasoned pros.<\/li>\n<li><b>Access your books from anywhere<\/b>, as long as you have an internet connection. Most systems are also mobile-ready and can be accessed on tablets, smartphones, as well as PCs.<\/li>\n<li><b>Multiple users can collaborate and work on system data simultaneously<\/b>. All changes are saved to the cloud \u2013 instantly. And, because of the inherent mobility of these systems, you can invite your accountant, financial advisor and others to access your books remotely. Leave notes for your accountant within the system and collaborate more effectively with those who are there to help you succeed!<\/li>\n<li><b>Simplified, worry-free IT<\/b>. Because the software is stored and managed in the cloud, IT tasks (fixes, upgrades, data back-up) are managed by the vendor (this alone is a huge time and cost saving for any small business).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How to Evaluate Online Accounting Software<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are many options when it comes to choosing online accounting software. So where do you begin? Your accountant is a great starting point for getting valuable advice on which one to choose and can ensure you get the functionality you need, within your budget.<\/p>\n<p>Typical features of online accounting systems include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Estimate and invoice generation<\/li>\n<li>Multiple online customers payment options<\/li>\n<li>Online payroll and payroll tax filing<\/li>\n<li>Inventory tracking<\/li>\n<li>Expense import tools and tracking<\/li>\n<li>One click financial reporting \u2013 accounts aging, P&amp;L and tax reporting, balance sheet generation, and more<\/li>\n<li>Dashboard reporting that provides a window on your business health, red flags and key actions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want to pay attention to the capabilities offered by the software\u2019s extended community in the form of add-ons (think of them as the accounting world\u2019s equivalent to smartphone apps) \u2013 more on this below. Finally, find out how easy it is to migrate off the platform should you choose to change your vendor. Likewise, what happens to your data once you terminate your contract?<\/p>\n<p>For a useful comparison of some of the leading applications designed to meet both the budget and the needs of a typical small office or small business, check out these <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/729385\/5_Top_Picks_for_Small_Business_Cloud_Based_Accounting?page=1&amp;taxonomyId=600009\">5 Top Picks for Small Business Cloud-Based Accounting<\/a> from CIO.com.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plan Your Switch from One Accounting System to Another<\/strong><br \/>\nIf your existing desktop software is available as an online version, it\u2019s likely that the switch will be fairly seamless, but there are some best practices that are worth building into your transition plan:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Get Familiar<\/b> \u2013 Take advantage of free trial offers and tutorials to familiarize yourself with the software before making the switch.<\/li>\n<li><b>Run Parallel Systems <\/b>\u2013 If you already have an accounting system, it\u2019s worth running the two side-by-side for a few months until you\u2019ve got the hang of the new system.<\/li>\n<li><b>Plan your Go Live Date<\/b> \u2013 The first day of your business\u2019 fiscal year is a clean transition point since you\u2019ve closed the books on last year\u2019s transactions and most of the data won\u2019t need to be altered. If January 1 is a stretch for you and your staff, pick a clean cut-off date such as after your taxes are filed.<\/li>\n<li><b>Prepare your Data <\/b>\u2013 Make sure your data is clean, taxes are filed and records reconciled.<\/li>\n<li><b>Build a Checklist <\/b>\u2013 Create a checklist of the data you\u2019ll need to enter or import such as client and employee information, accounts receivable\/payable reports, cash expense categories, bank feeds, etc. If you are moving from one system to another, take advantage of available import tools where you can and consider bringing in your accountant or hiring one for the duration of the transition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And of course, set aside time to practice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use Add-Ons to Build a More Robust Business Tool<\/strong><br \/>\nAs you start to get more familiar with the system and your needs evolve, you might want to consider incorporating add-ons. These third party tools are designed to augment your cloud software in areas such as CRM, project management, payroll, even marketing. For example, if you want to send marketing emails to the contacts in your accounting system, you can incorporate third-party add-ons that integrate popular email tools like Mail Chimp, Constant Contact, and more. \u00a0Each vendor makes a point of touting their available add-ons, here are links to those offered by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/add-ons\/\">Xero<\/a>, FreshBooks, and <a href=\"http:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/addons\">QuickBooks Online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you are looking for ways to be more efficient and bring greater financial insight to your business, making the switch to online accounting can be a real time saver and streamline many day-to-day financial management tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Are you considering making the switch or have you done so already?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way small businesses organize and manage every stage of the accounting process, from time sheets &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3125,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232,10147],"yst_prominent_words":[4070,741,1216,4067,723,4073,4071,1179,4072,4068,870,1495,1491,1186,712,1688,4074,4069,4066,2091],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Why and How You Should Switch to an Online Accounting Software","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Switching to online accounting software not only makes sense today more than ever before, it is also much easier than it used to be.
