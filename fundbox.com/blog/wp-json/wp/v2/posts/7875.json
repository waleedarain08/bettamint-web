Business Meetups and Local\u00a0Business Resources<\/h1>\n<p>For small business owners in Maryland and Virginia, Washington D.C. isn\u2019t just the home to politicians and powerbrokers. In fact, the city and surrounding counties is a hub of entrepreneurial activity. With the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world on its doorstep (the federal government) and an affluent, highly-educated population, the opportunities for business meetups and growth are extraordinary.<\/p>\n<p>We\u00a0spoke with Jennifer Eddy, a\u00a0strong advocate of business meetups.\u00a0Jennifer is the owner and Chief Strategist of <a href=\"http:\/\/eddycommunications.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Eddy Communications<\/a> a strategy and growth management consulting firm. Splitting\u00a0her time between Virginia and Washington, D.C., Jenn found that meetups are a secret weapon for her business and brand:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Small business meetup events are a great way to promote your business, network, and find local advocates who can help you grow. In addition to meeting new people and getting introduced to their network of connections, you can often participate in trainings, hear first-hand about changes to the community that will affect your business, and often you&#8217;ll meet local leaders you can call on to help when times are challenging. It&#8217;s always nerve wracking to walk into a room full of people you don&#8217;t know but the value is almost always there if you proactively look for it.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, are you searching for a small business meetup in the Washington D.C. metro area? We curated a short list of local business owner gatherings\u00a0in and around the nation\u2019s capital<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Washington D.C. Co-Working Spaces<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Co-working spaces often serve as a hub and a priceless resource for local businesses. While some companies may rent\u00a0a desk or even a meeting room at a co-working space, other owners visit these spaces for the purpose of networking and business development. For example, WeWork, the famous co-working space company, has ten\u00a0locations in the D.C. area alone:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m12!1m8!1m3!1d46972.52239361418!2d-77.0588507!3d38.886905!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!2m1!1swashington+d.c.+wework!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1501637667405\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Co-working spaces aren\u2019t just about offering entrepreneurs an office to work and collaborate.\u00a0They are also great for rubbing shoulders with other business owners, creating opportunities to network, learn, partner, or even build new client relationships.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cCo-working and incubators can be very helpful to small business owners because they facilitate collaboration, training and partnership between smaller firms and remote workers from larger shops.\u201d\u00a0says Jenn Eddy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Washington D.C.\u00a0Meetups for Business Owners<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>EventBrite<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>EventBrite has evolved from a ticket purchasing portal to a searchable database of events in any town across America.
