When it comes to loans, there are two major types: unsecured and secured.<\/p>\n<p>The primary difference between secured and unsecured loans is that a secured loan requires an asset to act as security. In other words, it\u2019s a collateral business loan that requires you to put something up in exchange for financing (e.g., commercial real estate or a company car).<\/p>\n<p>An unsecured loan is a no-collateral loan that has no such requirement. While there are some business loans available that require no collateral, they are not as easy to find nor as readily available as a standard secured loan.<\/p>\n<p>While we cannot advise on which is better for you, it\u2019s helpful to understand both options if you\u2019re seeking business funding.<\/p>\n<h2>How do traditional secured loans work?<\/h2>\n<p>Most people are familiar with the idea of a secured loan since they may already use lending of this type as consumers.<\/p>\n<p>A mortgage, for example, is the best-known secured loan, with the collateral being your home. If you fail to make your mortgage payments, eventually, the lender would be able to repossess the property.<\/p>\n<p>The whole point of setting up a secured loan is to reduce the lender\u2019s risk. This is why so many lenders prefer to only offer this type of loan, especially to new startups that are inherently riskier.<\/p>\n<h2>Alternatives to collateral, or\u00a0collateral under another name?<\/h2>\n<p>If you are looking for a no-collateral loan, there are limited options. And, even then, many lenders still reduce their risk through other requirements that give them leverage in case of default, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A personal guarantee: If you take out a loan with a personal guarantee instead of a specific item of collateral, you will be making a guarantee that you, as an individual, will pay the debt should your company default on the loan.<\/li>\n<li>A blanket UCC lien: This is another option when lenders do not ask for a particular item of collateral. A blanket UCC lien may be placed on the business. That means should it default on its payments, the lender can then pursue the company\u2019s assets as compensation for the remaining unpaid sum.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While neither of these options is something to discount from the equation completely, it is important to have a full understanding of what they entail for you and your company before signing on the dotted line.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9675\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg\" alt=\"Weighing your business funding options\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/fa6a3d61-1ac6-411a-ab36-380fb7de66f9_shutterstock_686615848-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How difficult is it to get a small business loan without collateral?<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to get an unsecured business loan for your startup or established small business, there are a few options to consider. These include:<\/p>\n<h3>SBA loans<\/h3>\n<p>An SBA loan is backed by a federal agency, the Small Business Administration. This type of loan may or may not require collateral, and even new startups may get a loan with no need for collateral via an approved SBA lender (e.g., Some 7(a) loans for less than $25,000)). There are, however, other SBA loans that will require collateral, so it\u2019s important to check before signing.<br \/>\nAre SBA loans hard to get?<br \/>\nThey can be. If you\u2019re looking for a relatively affordable form of lending, SBA loans could be the answer. Remember, though, SBA loans can take more effort to apply for, take longer to process, and they typically have rigorous eligibility requirements for approval.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about SBA loans and how to apply, check out our <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/sba-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comprehensive guide to SBA loans<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3>Online long-term loans<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many online lenders that offer short-term and long-term loans to companies. While both are \u201c<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/term-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">term loans<\/a><\/strong>,\u201d there are some key differences to keep in mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, a long-term loan is more traditional. The lender will advance a specific sum that will be repaid monthly over a set period of time. Though generally not as affordable as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/sba-loans-supporting-small-businesses-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, they are relatively affordable and applying is often faster and easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A short-term loan, on the other hand, also involves advancing a lump sum to the borrower, but this is then repaid in weekly or daily payments for a short period of around three to 18 months. This type of loan is usually more expensive, although it has relaxed eligibility requirements. It is also very easy to apply for when compared with traditional bank loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Merchant cash advances (MCAs)<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although merchant cash advances appear to require collateral, they actually do not. In fact, the financing company will only be buying your future assets\u2014nothing you own right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a business receives a merchant cash advance, the financing company is advancing a specified sum that is then paid back using a particular percentage of sales. In essence, it is purchasing a portion of the company\u2019s future sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eligibility requirements for this type of lending are comparatively loose, but there could be a risk to cash flow. It is important to proceed with caution when choosing this option, since many MCAs involve complex contracts and a variety of fees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you choose an MCA, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/get-the-lowdown-on-3-popular-smb-funding-options\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">read this article comparing MCAs with SBA loans and business lines of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Business credit cards<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit cards<\/a> are certain to be something you are already familiar with, and they are actually a surprisingly good way of financing a business\u2014especially when supplementing a traditional loan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A zero percent introductory APR card is typically the best option since this is essentially an interest-free loan that lasts for the duration of the specified introductory period. This will vary by card and could be as long as 15 months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you choose this option, having a clear repayment plan in place is essential since you will need to pay off the balance before the introductory period ends and the regular APR kicks in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Private lenders and fintech\u00a0firms<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, there are a lot of private lenders out there who are willing to offer loans without collateral, as long as the business owner offers a personal guarantee. This could be in the form of a cosigner, an asset or a commodity. Although, strictly speaking, this is not quite an unsecured loan, there are many more options for the commodities or assets that you can use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Innovations in technology have contributed to the emergence of new fintech firms, able to provide access to financing quickly and with relatively little paperwork.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you can apply for financing online without any specific collateral, and expect a credit decision in just minutes (3 minutes, actually, based on the median decision time for Fundbox customers). All Fundbox customers are subject to UCC-1 blanket liens. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/term-loan\/#how-it-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about how Fundbox loans work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Weighing the options<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When taking out a loan to fund your business, consider whether you really prefer an option that requires no collateral and why. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re concerned you may default and end up having your assets seized by the lender, it may not be the right time to seek financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you think you\u2019ll be in a more secure financial position soon? Or do you really need that financing now, in order to improve your position and save your business? If you are feeling confident in the future success of your operation, you might choose to wait and apply for a no-collateral loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, sometimes you\u2019re not worried about losing your assets at all. Instead, you might be more concerned with speed and the ease of getting funding.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some owners spend 30 hours or more on paperwork just to apply for a conventional term loan to fund their business, while others decide they just do not have that time to spare.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re simply concerned about the hassle and lengthy paperwork that a conventional loan could require, a faster fintech financing option might be what you\u2019re seeking.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal or accounting advice.
