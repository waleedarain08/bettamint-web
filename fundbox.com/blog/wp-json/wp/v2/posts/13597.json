Professional services firms in particular routinely come up against <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/avoid-5-major-cash-flow-mistakes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow constraints<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, hiring difficulties, and schedule setbacks.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And with business lagging due to COVID-19, many of the obstacles these companies face loom even larger right now. Fortunately, there are helpful solutions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a professional services company, here are the five most common challenges you might be facing\u2014and what you can do to overcome them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Maximizing billable hours\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a professional services firm, maximizing the number of billable hours per employee is critical to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintaining cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and increasing profits. \u201cTime is the inventory of service-run businesses, and it\u2019s a perishable resource that goes bad by the second,\u201d said Nick Bideshi, the CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/wearebluemeta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blue Meta<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a digital marketing agency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our biggest challenge is missing out on billable hours because of the fast-paced working environment we have,\u201d said Michael Hammelburger, the CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thebottomlinegroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bottom Line Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a company that helps business owners reduce their business expenses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe time spent on calls and online messaging with clients outside of work,\u201d he said, \u201cor the time spent traveling for consultations are just some of the hours that get neglected when consultants forget to log them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neglecting to log billable hours can cost your company thousands of dollars in revenue, but it\u2019s only part of the issue. The larger concern is making sure employees have enough billable work each week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximizing your employees\u2019 billable hours comes down to better organization and project management. Start by reviewing your record-keeping methods. \u201cWe have a dedicated team that administers a software tool that captures billable hours according to our billing guidelines,\u201d Hammelburger said. \u201cWe\u2019ve improved compliance and accuracy by 90% and avoided writing off billable hours just to fast-track payments from clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, consider your <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">project management techniques<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. How do you typically assign projects? Are some employees overworked while others sit idle? You may need to change your teams or distribution style to ensure everyone has enough billable work throughout the week.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Hiring and training\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-hiring-challenges-and-solutions-for-small-business-owners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a professional services firm can be a catch-22. You likely need to hire to help offset your project load, but hiring also creates more work for you and your team in the short-term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have to constantly balance hiring employees and onboarding clients,\u201d said Bideshi. Not only do you have to find, vet, and interview candidates, you also have to train them, which requires a significant amount of non-billable time and resources. Plus, depending on your new hire\u2019s experience level, it can take weeks or months for that person to become billable and start generating revenue for the company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent lost revenue and job opportunities, it can be helpful to try to shorten your company\u2019s time frame for hiring and training, while simultaneously increasing the checks and balances in the processes. Consider clarifying the scope of work in your job description, casting a wider net for candidates, or conducting more thorough interviews. These steps can help you find more experienced candidates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to training, the right <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/moving-business-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help speed up the process. \u201cWe\u2019ve automated 90% of our onboard training for non-management employees by using software solutions to hold courses meant for internal purposes,\u201d Bideshi said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Acquiring new clients\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining your existing clientele while searching for new clients is a perpetual challenge. Even if you have ongoing client relationships, it\u2019s still important to incorporate new clients to stay current, boost your revenue, and keep your team agile, said Sarah M. Williams, the founder and director of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/816nyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">816 New York<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a brand strategy and communications agency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPlus, you don\u2019t want to be too reliant\u2014especially now during COVID-19\u2014on only a few relationships, since things are so much in flux.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But getting new clients doesn\u2019t just happen with time and patience\u2014it also requires resources. You may have to budget for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new marketing initiatives<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, spend money on advertising campaigns, and carve out time for consultations and proposals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on revamping your marketing plan. \u201cWe have content marketing campaigns that run from our website that are meant to acquire leads, specifically those with communications strategy needs,\u201d Williams said. Content marketing efforts, as well as online ads and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">email nurture campaigns<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help bring more potential clients to you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertising any free services you offer is also a good idea. \u201cWe do a free 30-minute consultation,\u201d Williams said, \u201cwhich often turns into a proposal process if the lead seems strong enough.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also want to source potential clients from your network. Look into virtual conferences or discussion panels, or consider implementing a referral program to incentivize past and current clients to spread your name around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Planning for ongoing demand<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running a professional services firm means balancing your time between working on current projects and planning for future work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA client\u2019s budget can end, scale up, or start abruptly for various reasons,\u201d said Bideshi. \u201cIn a post-COVID-19 world, these ups and downs seem more violent than they did prior.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t plan for periods of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/10-ways-to-maximize-winter-downtime-in-your-construction-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">downtime<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or increased demand, certain areas of your business can suffer. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a marketing agency, for example, \u201cDemand for the design team could exceed its capacity, meanwhile the strategy or writing team doesn\u2019t have enough work,\u201d Bideshi said. This can throw off your project timelines and billable hours, both of which ultimately affect your profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDemand issues arise from not having consistency in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/creating-a-great-omnichannel-b2b-customer-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sales funnel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\u201d said Bideshi. \u201cThis can be due to overspecialization in the types of firms a company works with, or improper business development processes.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways to draw consistent leads and generate steady demand is to improve your sales funnel, Bideshi said. \u201cA key factor to consider is the monthly or yearly client churn based on revenue, not number of accounts.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, try using data to determine the strongest and weakest points in your sales funnel. If, for example, you know most of your clients leave your website after visiting the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/4-critical-ways-landing-pages-help-grow-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">landing page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, work on brainstorming ways to increase engagement at that stage. That might involve adding a video to the page, tightening the copy, or directing potential clients to a free consultation or discount on their first service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Waiting for client payments<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve always faced as a self-employed SEO and website designer is the amount of time it takes some companies to pay for the service they&#8217;ve requested,\u201d said Jase Rodley, the founder and CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dialedlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dialed Labs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a website design and SEO agency.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many professional services firms end up waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for their client payments. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the issue. According to a recent report, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/group.atradius.com\/publications\/payment-practices-barometer\/usmca-2020-late-payments-rise-as-recession-bites.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">late payments affect 43% of the total value of B2B invoices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> issued in North America this year. What\u2019s more, the total value of payments overdue by more than 90 days has doubled to 13%. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow thins out quickly when you\u2019re waiting for receivables, making it tricky to cover operating expenses, let alone budget for growth initiatives like hiring or investing in new technology.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The solution:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a handful of strategies you can use to keep <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/cash-flow-statement-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> steady. One option, Rodley said, is to charge a non-refundable deposit on your services. \u201cIt <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gives you some wiggle room for your bills without needing to be paid fully.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another option is to set up a payment plan. \u201cWe auto-bill our ongoing clients and put our project work on an installment plan that\u2019s also auto-billed, so we always get paid,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also negotiate with your suppliers or vendors to extend the deadlines for your payables, Hammelburger suggested. Just make sure you have a good relationship with those vendors; otherwise, you might risk burning a bridge.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having a difficult time trying to speed up your receivables or delay your payables, consider turning to an online lender. At Fundbox, we offer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/lines-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business lines of credit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overcoming your firm\u2019s challenges comes down to implementing more efficient systems\u2014for everything from sales to hiring.
