It&#8217;s hard to distill my mission into just a few words. I&#8217;m passionate about helping women in the workplace, through helping them make more money, get into positions of power and leadership, having freedom, independence. I want to help\u00a0women\u00a0create a life that feels good to them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">So what&#8217;s this through-line in all of those goals? It&#8217;s really <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">rising up<\/span>. The way that I define rising up is: thriving. We&#8217;re all just trying to survive, and that&#8217;s fine, but how do you take survival into thriving?<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I know that can mean different things for different women, so I didn\u2019t want to limit myself to only saying, \u201cI want to help women make more money,&#8221; though that is part of it. I want to help women become leaders. I want women to define \u201crising up\u201d\u00a0in their own way.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I am curious how you arrived at that, because there are a lot of ways to help women thrive. <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">W<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hat made you choose th<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">e financially-focused <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">path that you did choose<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0with Ladies Get Paid?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">C<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">W<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:<\/span>\u00a0I would say\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0not financially-focused, I would actually say, we&#8217;re freedom and power-focused, or self-worth-focused.\u00a0I do think money is often the best way to express that. Money is a huge part of what we do, but there&#8217;s a lot of ways to approach giving women power, which means making sure they understand their worth, and that they can articulate their worth, so that they can have power and the agency in their lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Money is the most important thing in the world. Whether you love it or not, it&#8217;s the currency that allows people to be independent. Being independent means they can walk away from any bad situations they are in, like\u00a0toxic work environments, bad managers, not getting paid enough. Ladies Get Paid helps them with that.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">H<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ave you always had an entrepreneurial streak?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0I\u2019ve definitely always had an entrepreneurial streak. I never was one of those people who said, &#8220;I want to be a CEO&#8221;\u00a0but when I look back, everything that I did was self-started. For example, I created a club to raise $10,000 to build an all-girls school in Afghanistan when I was in high school.\u00a0In college, I started a magazine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">It&#8217;s only upon reflection now that I see I was entrepreneurial. I think it\u2019s important to\u00a0look back to your history for\u00a0clues to who you are.\u00a0If you\u00a0study the\u00a0patterns, it will hopefully provide an indication of how\u00a0you can benefit the world.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">W<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hat in your background do you think has best prepared you for taking risks <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">like starting <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a business<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in the first place?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0Two mentors of mine do own their own businesses. They weren&#8217;t encouraging me to go down that route, but they were my example of how you could do something on your own and provide for others, and have the wonderful experience of being able to develop the skills of other people.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">That&#8217;s a privilege I don&#8217;t take lightly. I&#8217;m a co-founder and I have a part-time employee, and\u00a0I cannot wait to get full-time employees and get to be the person who gives them a wonderful experience.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Would you say that one of the best things about being a business owner or a founder is that kind of fulfillment of helping other people along with you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>Yes\u2014and because I haven&#8217;t had a full-time employee, this is me fantasizing about the future. But I can&#8217;t wait to get to build\u00a0a company culture from scratch, after seeing so many of the women in our community end up either not being happy and\u00a0leaving their\u00a0jobs. It\u2019s less about what they were doing at the company, more about the environment\u00a0and how they were treated.\u00a0After\u00a0all the bad managers that I had, I now get an opportunity to do it right.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">On the flip side, what <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">about<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0the hardest things about being a founder<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">: <\/span>So much to do with no time. I don&#8217;t want to burn myself out. I&#8217;ve done that before pretty much every job I&#8217;ve had. It&#8217;s really\u00a0a matter of prioritizing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The second part is money. For us, a huge way that we make money actually\u00a0corporate training and workshops. Sometimes we\u00a0work with companies where we come in-house and we teach. Those are steady paychecks and that&#8217;s wonderful as\u00a0it allows us to not put pressure on our community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">That being said, it can take up to six months\u00a0to make these deals. That\u2019s\u00a0six months of not knowing if it will work, and if it doesn&#8217;t, you may have to close your business. As every freelancer knows, until the contract is signed, you don&#8217;t have paycheck in hand.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10131\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10131\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10131\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/22384205_1933424546923320_5454511467270907845_o3.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees at a recent Ladies Get Paid event.\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10131\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Attendees at a recent Ladies Get Paid event.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">You mentioned <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">something important there: b<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">urnout. <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">T<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">here&#8217;s been a lot written about the phenomenon of <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the \u201c<\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1989\/06\/25\/books\/she-minds-the-child-he-minds-the-dog.html\">second shift<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0and emotional labor, and how women in general do more of it than men do, and that labor is not necessarily paid, not necessarily promotable or noticed. Do you think <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">these things are driving more burnout? Do you think<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0burnout is getting worse for female business owners or perhaps for millennials or younger entrepreneurs?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0Totally. I do think so, for a number of reasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">First of all, impostor syndrome. If you don&#8217;t know what impostor syndrome is, it&#8217;s basically the experience of feeling like you are a fraud. Or, when you sell yourself and you get an opportunity, worrying that\u00a0you&#8217;re not going to be able to deliver\u00a0and you will fail\u00a0and you will be judged.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">One of the consequences of [these fears]\u00a0is we overwork, we over-compare. We do this because we don&#8217;t think we\u2019re good enough\u00a0unless we overwork. That leads to burnout.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The first step to tackling burnout is to really examine your impostor syndrome and take the steps to combat it. [At Ladies Get Paid,] we teach a class on how to do that. I think that&#8217;s at the core of a lot of the challenges that women face, whether it&#8217;s advocating for a promotion, negotiating your salary, pushing back, drawing the boundaries. So many of us don&#8217;t feel like we\u00a0deserve it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Then the other part is, and this is particularly aimed at\u00a0millennials, we feel like we have to respond to our emails every second. You need to figure out a system, like\u00a0putting up an away message that sets expectations.\u00a0When\u00a0we are constantly responding to people, it is taking time away from other priorities, away from us being productive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Finally, make\u00a0a conscious decision to not feel guilty, whether you&#8217;re at work and not at home with your kids, whether you are at home with your kids and not at work, whatever. You have to say, &#8220;This is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">my<\/span>\u00a0life, I am in the moment with this person or this thing.&#8221; Whether it&#8217;s through practicing yoga or meditation, [you must] build the muscle of being in the moment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I think millennials,\u00a0in particular, suffer from not being in the moment because we&#8217;re so distracted, and we have constant access to our phones. That&#8217;s a huge issue, and if you&#8217;re a business owner or freelancer it&#8217;s even more compounded, because\u00a0we do have to be on duty a lot, because we\u00a0are wearing so many hats.\u00a0It&#8217;s all much easier said than done. I sound very wise but I\u2019m also working on it and\u00a0suffering from this.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I can believe it. There\u2019s a huge amount of stress and pressure in being a<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">n owner, and it\u2019s easy to feel like you can\u2019t miss a single call<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Looking more specifically at when you were starting out with Ladies Get Paid, <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">let\u2019s talk<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0about the nitty-gritty of how you got it started. How much money<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0did you have?<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">H<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ow did you get the money to get <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the organization<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0off the ground?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>This is where Fundbox certainly comes in; I really wish knew about you when I started.\u00a0Instead, I put it on a credit card. I didn\u2019t think to get small business loan. I didn\u2019t have knowledge of what that was. I used what I had readily accessible to me and what was familiar to me, and I put about $30,000 on my credit card.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Now, would I recommend that for people? Probably not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I had\u00a0a plan, I had goals\u00a0for myself of what\u00a0I wanted and by what time, the revenue I needed to be making. I was able to quickly see if I was going to make it and that I was going to make my credit card payments. I had prospects of getting freelance, and I had alternatives of things that could earn\u00a0me money. Putting [my startup expenses]\u00a0on the credit card\u00a0was a gamble, but I didn&#8217;t do it with blinders on. I would not recommend for most people to do what I did.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In the end, I\u00a0ended up paying\u00a0it all off. If I had to do it over,\u00a0I would put some amount on my credit card, certainly not the amount that I did before. My lesson in all of this has been that there are\u00a0multiple ways to get funding. It doesn\u2019t have to be venture capital, perhaps it could be angel investment, perhaps it could be Fundbox, small business loans, crowdfunding.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">I am\u00a0lucky in the sense that my business is diverse and not capital-intensive. It took a while and that\u2019s where having payment plans with my vendors, particularly expensive ones, have helped\u00a0me make those payments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">You can be very creative with how you make money. Two years later, some of our goals\u00a0are going to be more capital-intensive and I am open to getting more funding, whether it is small business loan, a credit line from Fundbox, or angel investment.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Or a combination of all of that. It sounds like you&#8217;re advocating not just being creative<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">about where you get working capital financing, but also <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">thinking about<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0the income<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">streams you can have as a business owner<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0We do. That was something also very scary to me. It&#8217;s that we only had one revenue source, that was nerve wracking<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">.<\/span>\u00a0Now, we have multiple and we&#8217;ve tested which ones bring us how much and how often. Revenue streams are important. It&#8217;s not one size fits all. Things change as your business changes\u2014they <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">should<\/span>\u00a0change.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">When it comes to funding in your experience, where do most female entrepreneur<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">s <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">turn first and why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0I&#8217;m very much learning that,<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>too. I think\u00a0crowdfunding is really popular among\u00a0women. I&#8217;m generalizing,\u00a0but I think we tend to be very cooperative and have large networks of other women who want to help. We value our friendships.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Crowdfunding\u00a0also has a\u00a0low barrier to\u00a0entry. That said, it&#8217;s scary to publically\u00a0put yourself out there and risk failure. I think those are two things that are hard for women,\u00a0due to imposter syndrome and the way we&#8217;re socialized to not talk about money. [Crowdfunding is]\u00a0the platform that is most easily accessible, but at the same time, we have a lot of anxiety about doing it.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10132\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10132\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10132\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/static1.squarespace.png\" alt=\"Claire addresses the crowd at a recent Ladies Get Paid event\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-10132\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Claire addresses the crowd at a recent Ladies Get Paid event.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">We recently<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">published a report <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that we wrote about<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0the gender credit gap, called <\/span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/case-studies\/\">What If<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">, where we looked at trends in how men and women access business credit<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.

That&#8217;s where my mind stopped.\u00a0Now I know\u00a0there are companies like Fundbox. Now I know there&#8217;s a whole other option that doesn&#8217;t require me to walk into a bank and ask for a loan.

I&#8217;ve heard many people say that they may just keep\u00a0[their idea]\u00a0as a side hustle\u00a0because they feel like they don&#8217;t have the capital to take the\u00a0leap. Women are increasingly becoming the main breadwinners, so they are on the hook.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">F<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">or this generation, it may feel like there&#8217;s more than ever to lose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0Absolutely right. We&#8217;re also not building wealth at the rates our parents or grandparents were. We have a huge need to have savings in a way that, I think, our parents didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I have one last big question for you. What is it that you know now that you most wish you knew at the beginning when you were starting out with this business?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>It&#8217;s okay to ask for help. Something that I&#8217;m doing right now, so it took me literally almost three years to get to this place,\u00a0is talk to people who could share their expertise and allow me to ask questions. I never did that before, I just started the business on my own. I rarely asked anyone for help and when I did need help I didn&#8217;t even know who to go to.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">My ability to hustle and to do things on my own is great, but the downside of that is sometimes it actually makes things\u00a0harder. Now\u00a0I&#8217;ve gotten to a place where I know a lot of things and I also know what I don&#8217;t know in a really big way.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In the beginning I didn&#8217;t know what I didn&#8217;t know. Now\u00a0I\u00a0am looking at our community, Ladies Get Paid, and figuring out who can help me and who I can help.\u00a0I feel so grateful that I built a resource that I can use.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">That&#8217;s fantastic. <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">T<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hat comment<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that it&#8217;s okay for us to ask for help<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is something that I&#8217;ve heard time and again from <\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">many<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\u00a0different entrepreneurs. Why do you think entrepreneurs have such a hard time asking for help?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<\/span>I think again that comes\u00a0down to stubbornness, the feeling that I can do it on my own,\u00a0and also the\u00a0fear that you&#8217;ll look like a failure if you\u00a0show\u00a0any\u00a0weakness. I imagine men struggle with that as well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Another issue that may be more frequent with women, is that I&#8217;m worried that I&#8217;m bothering someone\u00a0that by asking for help. I worry that I&#8217;m burdening them.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">That&#8217;s one thing I love about communities like Ladies Get Paid, is that I know if I put a question out there or reach out to somebody, there&#8217;s no pressure, everyone&#8217;s there to help, voluntarily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">CW:<\/span>\u00a0Yes. I think the more you give, the more you get.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Yes<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">!
