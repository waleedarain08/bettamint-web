Proponents say that through meditation, we become more relaxed and more focused.<\/p>\n<p>Odds are companies like Google, Aetna and Goldman Sachs wouldn\u2019t embrace mindfulness if it didn\u2019t deliver results. The research that proves the effectiveness of mindfulness exists: Those who set aside ample time for introspection and meditation are likely to be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2015\/03\/24\/david-gelles-mindful-work_n_6933042.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">less stressed<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.psychcentral.com\/mindfulness\/2014\/06\/mindfulness-sugar-free-zero-calories-and-hours-of-energy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more energetic<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alicegwalton\/2013\/03\/27\/the-new-benefits-of-mindfulness-improved-memory-focus-and-gre-scores\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sharper<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, mindfulness:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Helps keep us in check. <\/strong>Mindfulness prevents those who practice it from becoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/toddessig\/2013\/11\/27\/mindfulness-is-a-useful-business-skill-new-research-suggests\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">drunk on power<\/a>. Outcomes and opinions are neither right nor wrong\u2014they just are. One recent study revealed that those who accept thoughts and emotions without judgment <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24098927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aren\u2019t as excited by immediate rewards<\/a>. This sets the stage for a productive, level-headed approach to work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Makes us healthier.<\/strong> For most of us, it\u2019s impossible to be as effective when we\u2019re sick. When we\u2019re more in tune with our thoughts, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2011\/11\/02\/mindfulness-meditation-health_n_1070101.html?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our blood pressure is lower, our immune system is stronger and we\u2019re less sensitive to pain<\/a>. Our memory also improves, and we\u2019re able to better focus on the task at hand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improves our relationships.<\/strong> Harvard Professor Ellen Langer says that when we\u2019re mindful, <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/03\/mindfulness-in-the-age-of-complexity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we like other people more<\/a>. We\u2019re more charismatic and less evaluative of the opinions of others, so they like us more, too. Mindfulness also improves the relationships we have with ourselves, helping us let go of regret, Langer says.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lets us disconnect.<\/strong> The world is powered by mobile devices. With email in our pockets at all times, it can be difficult to find time to enjoy a completely non-digital existence, if only for a few moments. Mindfulness serves as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/business\/21589841-western-capitalism-looking-inspiration-eastern-mysticism-mindfulness-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">great excuse to unplug<\/a>. Remember, clients won\u2019t vanish the second the screen goes black.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t sweat it: You don\u2019t have to devote entire days or even afternoons toward mindfulness in order to notice profound changes. In fact, spending <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/andy_puddicombe_all_it_takes_is_10_mindful_minutes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as little as 10 minutes a day<\/a> doing absolutely nothing, i.e., being alone with our thoughts without any distractions, can go a long way toward positively transforming our outlook on life and approach to work.<\/p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not that hard to get mindfulness and meditation started at your organization, either, thanks to apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.headspace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headspace<\/a> that provide users with customized mental training programs that can be accessed from any connected device.
