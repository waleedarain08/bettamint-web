It might be time to open a catering business, especially when summer is upon us. Just don&#8217;t forget to watch your cash flow!<\/p>\n<p>Getting started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/201656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may cost you anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000<\/a> so you\u2019ll have to figure out financing. On the plus side, you get to make your own schedule and can work out of the comfort of your own kitchen if you want.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t sound too bad for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/guides\/2011\/01\/how-to-start-a-catering-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting started in a $7.1 billion industry<\/a>, does it?<\/p>\n<h2>Starting\u00a0a Catering Business<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided to open a catering business, you\u2019ll need to come up with a name for it and set up your business formally. Register as an LLC, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secure an EIN<\/a> for tax purposes, and get your <a href=\"http:\/\/smallbusiness.chron.com\/licenses-need-home-cooking-business-3038.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insurance and licensing<\/a> situations squared away. Depending on the scope of your business and your living situation, you may have to secure a facility and equipment too.<\/p>\n<p>If possible, see if you can target a specific niche. You may not be able to cater a huge wedding off the bat, but you could probably handle a baby shower or small birthday party as you get started.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re planning to handle everything on your own, you\u2019ll need to hire some employees. Be sure to thoroughly train them so they know what\u2019s expected during customer interactions.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve figured out your target market and hired employees, you\u2019re ready to start advertising your catering business. Whenever possible, develop relationships with businesses that are well-positioned to recommend your services\u2014like florists, wedding photographers, and bridal shops.<\/p>\n<p>When a customer bites and there\u2019s a match, it\u2019s time to get to work. Pro tip: Prior to catering your first event, ask your friends to see whether they\u2019ll let you do a \u201ctrial run\u201d of sorts at one of their get-togethers. That way, you\u2019ll have a good idea where things stand before you start serving real customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Caterers &amp; Cash Flow Problems<\/h2>\n<p>In a perfect world, caterers would be able to focus solely on cooking and serving delicious foods and desserts. Instead of figuring out how to pay bills and where to advertise their services, they\u2019d be able to focus on their menu exclusively.<\/p>\n<p>But like all other small business owners, caterers are not immune from cash flow problems. In fact, they can encounter cash gaps for a variety of reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Customers might take a while to pay. <\/strong>It would be great if your customers paid you the moment you showed up at their event. Experience tells us that doesn\u2019t happen as often as we\u2019d like.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your supplier could change your account to COD (Collect on Delivery). <\/strong>Some suppliers are okay with giving you 30, 60 or even 90 days to pay your bills. But what happens when they change their policies, requiring you to pay for food items the moment they\u2019re delivered?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food may spoil. <\/strong>You may order too much food upfront. A storm may force an event to be postponed, leaving you with a ton of product. In either scenario, food may spoil\u2014and you obviously can\u2019t sell it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The price of food items may increase. <\/strong>Food shortages, inflation, or some combination thereof could drive up the cost of your supplies. In turn, you could raise prices\u2014but would your customers still pay?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Taxes or wage expenses may increase due to government regulations. <\/strong>Whether it\u2019s higher taxes, a bolstered minimum wage or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the changes to overtime pay<\/a> coming down the pike, government action could take a bite out of your bottom line.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Cash flow problems can adversely affect caterers, making it impossible to hire workers, get needed supplies, or generate excess revenue by taking on a number of gigs at once.<\/p>\n<p>Still, they don\u2019t have to be a death sentence. By familiarizing yourself with the financial tools at your disposal, you\u2019re able to overcome cash shortages and continue growing your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Bridging Cash Flow Gaps with Fundbox<\/h2>\n<p>With a line of credit from <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a>, you can help bridge cash flow gaps, letting you redirect all of your energies toward improving your operations.
