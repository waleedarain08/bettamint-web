Many veterans struggle with finding a job where they feel satisfied. Returning to a conventional job can feel challenging: it\u2019s one thing to follow orders to protect the freedom of the nation; it\u2019s another to be told what to do by a manager. Instead, many veterans decide to pursue entrepreneurship to become their own bosses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veterans play a vital role in the economic stability of the private sector. In fact, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.com\/resources\/military-owned-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">millions of businesses in the U.S. are veteran-owned<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, like other small business owners, as a veteran, you may struggle with the same challenges that come with launching and running a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/veteranbusinesscoalition.org\/the-death-and-rebirth-of-veteran-entrepreneurship\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Coalition for Veteran-Owned Business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, nearly 25% of veterans want to start a business; however, a mere 6% actually go through with it. Why? Because the reality is that veterans don\u2019t have enough access to financing and the resources to help them acquire the capital and training they need to start a business successfully. Sadly for the veterans who start their businesses with personal and family savings, it\u2019s often not enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, there are loans designed specifically for veterans through the Small Business Administration (SBA). There are also other small business loan <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/facts-veterans-and-entrepreneurship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">options for veteran entrepreneurs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that are ideal for start-ups, fast cash, working capital, and financing for expansion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the best loans and financing opportunities available for veterans:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBA offers several small business financing options reserved for veterans. Here are two examples of veterans-only loans:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan (MREIDL):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/disaster-assistance\/military-reservist-loan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MREIDL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is available to military reservists whose business\u2019s financial goals were unmet because an essential employee was called up to active duty. The loan is a temporary source of financing to cover operating expenses until the reservist is discharged.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>SBA Veterans Advantage Program:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The VA loan typically has lower rates and fees compared to traditional loans. Under the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/articles\/Veterans_Advantage_Borrower_Fact_Sheet_FY17_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA veterans advantage program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, businesses can get up to $150,000 with no upfront fees.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most members of the regular military, National Guard, reservists, and veterans are eligible to\u00a0apply for a VA loan. Specifically, to qualify for a VA business loan, the business must be 51% owned and controlled by one of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An honorably discharged veteran<\/li>\n<li>A service-disabled veteran<\/li>\n<li>An active-duty military member participating in the military Transition Assistance Program<\/li>\n<li>A reservist or member of the National Guard<\/li>\n<li>A spouse of any of the above<\/li>\n<li>A widowed spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty or from injuries sustained as a result of their service<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2. Veteran-specific financial groups<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veteran-specific financial groups aim to make it easier for military members to obtain the funds they need to grow their businesses. Here are some examples:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hiversandstrivers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Hivers and Strivers<\/b><\/a><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hivers and Strivers is an angel funding firm that funds early-stage companies founded by graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, or Merchant Marine Academy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.streetshares.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>The Streetshares Foundation<\/b><\/a><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In addition to short-term loans, the foundation offers monthly grants and loans for veteran-owned businesses (or ones run by their spouses), prioritizing businesses based on their social impact and the strength of their business idea. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bunkerlabs.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Bunker Labs<\/b><\/a><b>: <\/b>Bunker Labs is a nonprofit organization that provides access to a national network of veteran and milspouse entrepreneurs dedicated to helping veterans and others in their transitioning military community start their own business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3. Traditional banking institutions<\/h2>\n<p>Traditional financial institutions are options for veterans who have solid credit scores. Unfortunately, over the last several years, banks have signed off on fewer and fewer business loans. In fact, banks only approved 25.3% of the small business loans that came their way in 2018.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Crowdfunding<\/h2>\n<p>Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and AngelList\u00a0are some of the best crowdfunding sites for small businesses. This option is ideal for veteran entrepreneurs who are building products or creating services. Crowdfunding connects entrepreneurs to donors and investors who believe in the veteran\u2019s project or business idea.<\/p>\n<p><em>Considering crowdfunding? Here are 5 <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-pros-and-cons-of-crowdfunding-your-businesses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pros and cons of crowdfunding your business<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>5. Invoice factoring and invoice financing<\/h2>\n<p>Does your business have a lot of unpaid invoices? With invoice factoring, you can sell them at a discount, giving your fast cash and saving you the time you\u2019d spend tracking down your clients to pay up. With this option, you forgo a chunk of your revenues since the invoice factoring company owns your invoices and therefore, collects payments directly from your customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in getting some funds from your accounts receivable, but you would rather maintain control of your relationship with those customers, check out a similar option, called invoice financing.<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn about how<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/invoice-factoring\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice financing<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> differ and what they can offer.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2>6. Business lines of credit<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike other forms of financing, you don\u2019t have to pay interest on the full sum you borrow when you secure a business line of credit. Instead, you pay interest only on the portion of the credit you actually use.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process for applying and getting a line of credit varies depending on which firm you work with, but the internet and AI technology have combined to dramatically speed it up in recent years. With alternative lenders like <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong> that offer business lines of credit<\/strong>, you can secure credit limits of up to $100,000 that you can repay over 12 or 24 weeks via auto debit. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Fundbox, you can apply online without any paperwork to get started, and can expect a credit decision <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in as little as 3 minutes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to learn more about lines of credit for your business?
