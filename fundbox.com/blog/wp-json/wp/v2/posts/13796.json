The COVID-19 pandemic hasn\u2019t merely caused us panic and ill-health: it\u2019s also spawned major changes to everything from how we work to how we spend our free time. It\u2019s understandable, then, that businesses owners have struggled to adapt (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/adjusting-new-normal-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">though many have thrived<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these arduous times, then, it\u2019s vitally important to do everything we can to operate efficiently and as painlessly as possible. This reduces the likelihood of burnout (which is a major threat these days) and helps businesses keep going in a global recession that may drag on for years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that end, this piece is going to focus on the implementation of fleet management methods\u2014more specifically, how it can help companies (particularly those in the transport industry) with reducing their costs, improving their profits, and overcoming obstacles. Let\u2019s get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuel cards can lower operational costs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest expenses for any company with major transport requirements will always be fuel. Regardless of which fuel type you prefer, you\u2019ll likely need to issue payments on a daily basis, and this can be an awkward process. You can save money if you use a single source with a cheaper arranged rate, but that won\u2019t help you when things go awry and you need to refuel elsewhere. This is why fuel cards may be worth investing in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fuel card is similar to a credit card, only it\u2019s linked to an account intended specifically to pay for fuel. Many fuel and pump brands offer their own unique fuel cards (you can see a range of them <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icompario.com\/en-gb\/fuel-cards\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), with each conferring distinct benefits. You may be able to get a cheaper rate on a certain type of fuel, or get a discount every time you refuel at a particular type of station.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since some fuel cards cost nothing to use, and others have modest monthly fees, it\u2019s extremely likely that you\u2019d benefit financially from giving your fleet drivers fuel cards. It would also track your fuel payments automatically, which could save you some tedious admin work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GPS tracking can bolster route optimization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not tracking where your vehicles go, you may be making a serious mistake. Barring the occasional exception (needing to travel down a specific road at a specific time in a specific manner, for instance), there\u2019s always something you can do to make your travel routes more efficient and economical.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is about going beyond simply paying close attention to traffic and using things like Google Maps to good effect. It\u2019s about logging all your routes and reviewing them afterwards to figure out how they could have been handled better. Could you have yielded better results by making the driver\u2019s start time slightly earlier <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">slightly later?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of viable IoT systems out there (here are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/best\/best-gps-fleet-tracking-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some suggestions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), so look for one that suits your situation and budget, then make it a core part of your operational review process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Telematics can simplify insurance claims<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encompassing a lot of information, the point of a modern telematics system (going beyond the GPS tracking we just looked at) is to collect as much useful data as possible. Installing a good telematics unit on each fleet vehicle will allow you to form a timeline of events: when the vehicle slowed down, when it sped up, when the driver applied the brake, when they swerved, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This information isn\u2019t just handy for the aforementioned route optimization process. It\u2019s also handy for dealing with any safety incidents that arise. In the event of a crash, for instance, having access to telematics data can confirm that your driver acted appropriately and wasn\u2019t at fault. This can make it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much easier to get the warranted payout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does require your drivers to be resolutely professional, of course, and can work against you if you have an inadequate hiring process (as in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insurethebox.com\/ground-breaking-victory-for-telematics-data-as-court-rejects-fraudulent-insurance-claim\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this case<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)\u2014but if you use lazy or poorly-trained drivers then you have much bigger problems than fleet management. Invest in your drivers, then use their skills to your advantage through telematics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In the end, fleet management is all about making your business transport processes as simple, easy, cheap and productive as you can manage. If you just need the occasional van journey that you don\u2019t need to worry too much about it\u2014but if you have anything more than a handful of vehicles traveling semi-regularly for business, you can certainly benefit by investigating fleet management hardware and accompanying software.<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year has been exponentially more stressful in general than any in recent memory.
