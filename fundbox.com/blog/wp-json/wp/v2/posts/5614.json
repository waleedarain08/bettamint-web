In order to grow your business, you need access to cold hard cash\u2014it&#8217;s that simple.\u00a0Factoring is an option, but is it really the one you want?<\/p>\n<p>Though they need funds, many businesses are hesitant to take out loans for a number of reasons. Maybe they don&#8217;t want to incur debt, don&#8217;t want to put up collateral, or don&#8217;t have the time to endure a drawn-out application process, among other things. As a result of this loan aversion, some business owners turn to legacy invoice factoring services to get the money they need.<\/p>\n<p>Quite simply, factoring is the process through which businesses sell their accounts receivables to third parties. While factoring can certainly help companies overcome short-term cash gaps, there are a number of reasons why the particular financial tool is less than optimal:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Factoring is expensive<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>First things first: The average factoring company charges anywhere between <a href=\"http:\/\/fitsmallbusiness.com\/how-invoice-factoring-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">28% and 60% APR<\/a>. On top of that, factoring companies generally advance somewhere between 70% and 85% of the cost of the invoices. So in addition to incurring hefty fees, you also lose immediate access to a significant chunk of your receipts.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>It can be embarrassing<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When you partner with a factoring company, that organization owns your invoices. This means that your customers will repay the factoring company directly\u2014not you. The factoring company also handles collections, so it brings your cash flow struggles right out in the open for everyone to see.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Your business loses agility<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Many factoring companies are keen on locking their customers into long-term contracts. Even if you&#8217;ve grown your business and are ready to move on, the factoring company may want to keep its tentacles in you longer than you&#8217;d like.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There&#8217;s good news: Instead of paying more than you need to pay in order to regain control of your finances, you can use an invoice financing service like Fundbox to solve your cash flow problems and take your business to the next level. With Fundbox, you won&#8217;t have to worry about hurting your reputation or relinquishing any control of your operations either.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: Create an account and connect your accounting software to the service.
