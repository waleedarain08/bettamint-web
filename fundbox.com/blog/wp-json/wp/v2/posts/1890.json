Jobs that once seemed secure have been outsourced, while many that remain have become automated or simply eliminated. In today&#8217;s &#8220;gig&#8221; economy, many workers create unconventional careers with a patchwork of jobs and <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/scaling-your-side-hustle-dont-make-these-mistakes\/\">side hustles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Understandably, today\u2019s workforce is wary of the companies for which they work and are very aware of the instability of the modern marketplace. A workforce of mercenaries has emerged, which includes some of the most talented people in their respective professions, seeking to take more control and steer their own careers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in the interest of your business to make the most of this situation. Chances are, you can profit from adding freelancers to your team. Full-time employees are certainly necessary, but there is value to be had in non-traditional, contractual workers, as well. With that in mind, here are a few places to find the free agents you need to succeed.<\/p>\n<h2>Fiverr<\/h2>\n<p>Founded in 2010, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr<\/a> quickly became a well-known destination for freelancers of all types, connecting anyone with access to service providers on their platform.

What this means to you is that no matter what kind of help you need, and no matter what your price point, you should be able to find it here.<\/p>\n<h2>Upwork<\/h2>\n<p>Formerly, ElanceoDesk, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/\">Upwork<\/a> bills itself as the world\u2019s largest online workplace. It claims to provide $1 billion of work annually among 4 million clients, of whom more than 90% rehire.

You can even interview your favorite candidates right online.<\/p>\n<h2>Craigslist<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/craigslist.org\">Craigslist<\/a> still looks and feels extremely basic, but don&#8217;t be fooled.

An ad on this site will generate so many emailed resumes that you might need to hire someone else just to handle the incoming traffic.<\/p>\n<p>The downside to the ease and popularity of this site is that candidates aren\u2019t vetted and anyone can post, so you might have to sift through a lot of noise in order to find what you need.<\/p>\n<h2>Guru<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.guru.com\/\">Guru<\/a> boasts that you can use their platform to view more than 3.4 million services by category.
