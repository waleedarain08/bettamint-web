But in the early days of building a business, time and money are often in short supply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why you might consider <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/tips-for-partnering-with-another-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forming a strategic partnership<\/a> with another business. A strategic partnership is one of the best ways to combine your resources for future growth. It can help you reach a wider audience and access tools and resources you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what is a strategic partnership, and how can forming one help your business grow? That\u2019s exactly what this article will set out to explain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a strategic business partnership?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a strategic partnership, two businesses agree to share their resources to achieve further growth and mutual success. For instance, you might partner with another company in your industry to reach a new target market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategic partnerships are beneficial for companies of all sizes, but they can be extremely helpful for small businesses. That\u2019s because a strategic partnership can be a key growth strategy that allows you to compete with larger businesses.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the three types of strategic partnerships?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Joint venture:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In a joint venture, two companies combine their resources to accomplish a specific objective. Each company is responsible for the costs and profits that come from the venture. However, they remain two separate business entities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equity strategic alliance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In an equity strategic alliance, one company purchases equity in another company. Or sometimes, both companies will buy equity in the other company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Non-equity strategic alliance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a non-equity strategic alliance, two or more companies sign a contract to combine their resources. But they don\u2019t create a separate entity or share any equity.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes a good strategic partnership?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like you spent time thinking about your ideal customer, it\u2019s also a good idea to spend some time thinking about your ideal business partnership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most important things to look for is that both companies can offer something of unique value to the other. If the relationship is too one-sided, it\u2019s unlikely to work long-term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, it\u2019s a good idea to partner with companies that aren\u2019t your direct competitors. A good strategic partner will add value to your customers without directly competing with your products or services.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And both companies need to be excited about the partnership. Again, if one business receives significantly more value than the other, the partnership will most likely fall apart.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you create a strategic partnership?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/8-questions-to-ask-before-entering-into-a-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategic partnership<\/a> is a great way to expand your customer base, leverage additional resources, and grow your revenue. But you want to make sure you go about it in the right way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t rush the process<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anytime you\u2019re entering into a new strategic partnership, it\u2019s essential to set a strong foundation. This is especially important when each company has a significant <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-split-profits-in-a-small-business-partnership\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">financial stake in the partnership<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take some time to discuss your company culture, communication style, and expectations. Don\u2019t just assume that everyone involved is on the same page &#8212; take the time to think through how you\u2019ll interact and collaborate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing this will give your partnership the best chance of being successful. It can help to create a written vision for how you\u2019ll work together and what you plan to accomplish.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain strong communication<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the strongest business relationship can erode due to poor communication. One of the best ways to avoid this is by scheduling regular meetings to talk about the business. Not only will this give your partnership the best chance of success, but it will also help you build trust on both sides.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And each business will bring different skill sets and resources to the table. So if possible, try to let both sides focus on what they do best. For instance, one company may excel at sales marketing while the other may be better at forecasting and budgeting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And finally, invest in the tools and processes that will help both businesses work together effectively. The right resources can help you bridge the occasional communication gap.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take time to reassess<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relationships change and evolve, and strategic business partnerships are no different. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to regularly reassess where you\u2019re at and if the partnership is still beneficial for both sides.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are your priorities still aligned, and are both companies still focused on the end goal? These kinds of conversations can be uncomfortable, but they will help you avoid bigger problems in the long run. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a small business owner, you want to do everything you can to help your business be successful.
