You get a successful business model with name recognition and the freedom to run it much as your own. The flip side is that it comes with many expenses unique to franchises, including some fixed fees. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you want to add a new franchise location or expand or support your existing one, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">credit from Fundbox<\/a> can help with many of these common expenditures and potential cash flow issues.

Unlike royalties, you may be responsible for these payments regardless of how much revenue you take in. These costs vary by business, industry, and state but should be detailed in your franchise disclosure document (FDD) or other contract. Such fees typically include:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Franchise and licensing fees <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be between $20,000 and $50,000 to start, and some require annual renewals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Travel fees <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for airfare and living expenses may be needed periodically for training your team at franchise headquarters or for annual meetings.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Co-marketing fees<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may be required on a monthly or yearly basis to support your franchisor\u2019s expenses for national advertising services they provide, like television and magazine ads.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Inventory and supplies <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may be required by your franchise contract to be stocked at minimum levels.

Saying yes to more new business<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the key risks of growing a business\u2014especially in materials and labor-intensive industries like construction and maintenance\u2014is fronting the costs required to take on new jobs. After you secure supplies and hire the help, you have to wait until the job is done to bill the client, and wait another 30 days (or more) for them to pay. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Late payments are a common problem for businesses like yours. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/fundbox-study-reveals-crippling-effects-of-late-or-unpaid-invoices-300424576.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 64% of SMBs get paid late, and as a result, 23% can&#8217;t invest in new equipment or hire new employees, and 17% can\u2019t build up inventory.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>&#8220;When we are not paid on time or slowly, we cannot obtain big customers because big customer accounts require more capital to service.&#8221; <\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jose Ramirez, owner, Supreme Maintenance Solutions<\/span><\/i><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One\u00a0 alternative to growth is turning away potential business that could very well go to your competitors. By smoothing out the bumps caused by monthly income variations, or by injecting a needed boost in capital, a line of credit can help you ramp up for new business, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Bringing on new people<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, by hiring the internal talent or short-term contract labor<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Paying for materials in bulk <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so they&#8217;re on-hand to start projects, and some suppliers require cash for bulk purchases<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Maintaining uninterrupted supplies<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> during spikes in business\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Investing in faster equipment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, upgrading computers, software, or even cutting-edge tools like laser die-making machines, digital presses, or 3D printers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>3. Stocking up for your seasons<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is affected by cyclical demand, such as in construction, HVAC, or tourism-related maintenance, a line of credit can do much more than tide you over during leaner months. It can prepare for the next big season and meet future customer demand by investing in supplies, equipment, or inventory in advance. Tapping into your line of credit lets you:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Save money<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by resupplying or buying off-season, when prices are lowest.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reduce downtime<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by performing deferred or preventive maintenance on your vehicles or machinery.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Add new capabilities<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through modernized equipment, new software, or new skills.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Improve relationships<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with suppliers and key partners by making larger deals.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Diversify your offerings<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by adding alternate services for all seasons. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>4. Expanding your current location<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many business owners might first consider traditional construction loans for building, repairing, or expanding their commercial structure. However, such loans usually require additional costs and red tape, including a down payment, appraisal fees, excellent personal credit, financial documentation, and more. A business line of credit may be faster and much easier to secure and help cover short-term costs like:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Remodeling<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or repairing your existing facility<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Growing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your existing square footage<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Branching<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out with a satellite office<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Updating <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your company branding, signage, and decor<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Complying<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with mandated fire codes, ADA standards, zoning, or other laws<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><b>\u201cOur partnership with Fundbox has allowed us to start and grow this division.
