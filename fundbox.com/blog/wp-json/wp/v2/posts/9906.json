However, getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE) can help you overcome some of these challenges by giving you access to programs that provide professional connections and resources that can help strengthen your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a certified MBE, you\u2019ll have more opportunities to bid for both corporate and federal business contracts. You can also be eligible for funding, such as grants, and participate in business development training. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the different avenues for certification and how they can benefit your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Minority Business Enterprise?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Minority Business Enterprise is most commonly defined as a company that is at least 51 percent owned and operated by an individual who is a U.S. citizen and is at least 25 percent African American, Asian American, Pacific Islander, Latinx or Hispanic, or Native American descent. If the company is publicly traded, there can be requirements that enforce shareholder and employee diversity, as well. Oftentimes, a publicly traded company must be at least 51 percent minority-owned, and the core management and operations of the company must be controlled by team members who are part of these minority groups. The business must also <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be a for-profit enterprise and physically located in the U.S. or its trust territories.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of getting certified as a Minority Business Enterprise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting an MBE certification can support your business strategy by opening up additional opportunities for you to secure funding and drive revenue.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few of the major advantages to getting your business certified as an MBE:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Network expansion: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connect with other MBEs for potential joint-venture and partnership opportunities.

Certification means you can compete for these contracts and connect with advisors who can help you navigate the process. This can open up your business to new opportunities and important relationships you might not have found otherwise.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Access to funding: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are programs available across the country to help minority-owned businesses receive access to capital they might not otherwise be able to generate from their own networks. These programs provide grants and loans that can help you reach your business goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Incentivizes investment and partnership:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Both state and federal tax benefits are available to other businesses that engage with MBE-certified organizations.
