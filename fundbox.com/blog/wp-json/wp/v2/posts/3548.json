SBA loans are also experiencing an <a href=\"https:\/\/colemanreport.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upward trend<\/a> with YTD lending volumes exceeding last year.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re back to pre-recession levels yet. Large banks are only approving 20% of small business loans, up 9% from three years ago (before the recession the New York Times reports that levels were at 36%).<\/p>\n<p>That being said, the emerging powerhouses of small business lending are smaller banks. These are currently approving more than half the loan applications that cross their desks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take Advantage of Year-End Deals<\/strong><br \/>\nWhile the lending market is slowly getting its health back, it\u2019s not there yet, and banks know it. This is where business borrowers have the advantage. Banks are in business too and like all sales organizations want to close the year strong. This means there may be some sweet deals out there before the end of the year for small businesses looking to fund growth in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Consider shopping around for low rates \u2013 talk to banks big and small and weigh up your priorities. Big banks may offer lower rates, but they can be bureaucratic. Smaller community banks are geared towards understanding and supporting the neighborhoods in which they\u2019re located, and might be able to offer a relationship that\u2019s more mutually beneficial.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Interest Rates are Still Low \u2013 For Now<\/strong><br \/>\nInterest rates have been kept low to boost the economy, will this continue into 2016? If inflation rises, then interest rates may follow. Now might be the time to take advantage of current interest rates, before they expire.<\/p>\n<p>If you find that you don\u2019t qualify for a traditional bank loan, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sba.gov\/loanprograms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SBA loan programs<\/a> offer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sba.gov\/content\/7a-loan-amounts-fees-interest-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lower interest rates<\/a> and guarantees (which alleviate the peril to lenders of taking on higher risk borrowers). Interest rates on SBA-backed loans are negotiated between the lender and you. However, the SBA does apply maximums to these, plus 2.25% for a loan that matures in less than seven years (2.75% beyond that). The SBA doesn\u2019t fund the loan, the bank does, so talk to your branch first, they can help you select the right loan and assist with the application process.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t Forget to Have a Financial Contingency Plan<\/strong><br \/>\nYear-end planning aside, the absolute best time to borrow money is before your need it!<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, you have a business plan that accounts for any major financial scenarios on the horizon, but businesses also need to plan for the unexpected such as a sudden need for additional inventory or potential cash flow issues. Take steps now to ensure you can cover these costs, before it\u2019s too late and you\u2019re forced into a hasty, high-interest loan. You can take advantage of cash flow management services from <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_medium=content&amp;utm_source=blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a>.
