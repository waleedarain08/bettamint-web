Fundamentally, accounting comes down to a simple equation. Assets = Liabilities + Equity. It seems simple enough but let\u2019s really break it down. What do these terms mean in relation to your business and how can they help you make sense of the books?<\/p>\n<h2>Assets<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever heard the phrase \u201cTom is an asset to the company\u201d? The meaning is clear. Tom is a good worker that brings value to the organization. In accounting terms, an asset is any item of value to the company: tangible (property, inventory, equipment) or intangible (patents, trademarks, copyrights, accounts receivable and even reputation).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here\u2019s how to calculate total assets:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider what assets you have, including any current, fixed, and even <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">intangible<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> resources that could be of financial value to your business. For example:<\/span>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current assets (assets that can be converted into cash within one year or less) such as cash, outstanding invoices owed to you, and inventory that can be sold<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed assets (things of value that are harder to convert into cash) such as real estate, heavy machinery, furniture, vehicles, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-term investments, like stocks and bonds<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intangible assets that have value, such as your company\u2019s brand, reputation, social media following, and your company&#8217;s or employees\u2019 status as influencers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make a balance sheet\u2014a financial statement that shows a company\u2019s assets, liabilities and equity. (See \u201cAssets = Liabilities + Equity\u201d below.) To create this balance sheet, you can use a spreadsheet software like Excel, but you should <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/make-the-move-from-excel-to-accounting-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider using accounting software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for such important statements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Liabilities<\/h2>\n<p>Meet Michael. Tom&#8217;s friend. Unlike Tom, Michael is a liability to the company. Being an inherently negative term, Michael is not thrilled with this description.<\/p>\n<p>Under the umbrella of accounting, liabilities refer to a company\u2019s debts or financially-measurable obligations. Liability is also classified\u00a0as current or\u00a0long-term.<\/p>\n<p>Current liabilities are obligations that the company should settle one year or less. They consist, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predominantly<\/span>, of short-term debt repayments, payments to suppliers, and monthly operational costs (rent, electricity, <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/abcs-accounting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accruals<\/a>) that are known in advance. And finally, current liabilities are typically paid with Current assets.<\/p>\n<p>Long-term liabilities, on the other hand, include debt such as mortgages or loans used to purchase fixed assets. These are paid off over years instead of months.<\/p>\n<p>Why is all this important?<\/p>\n<p>Because a company\u2019s working capital is the difference between its current assets and liabilities. And that&#8217;s important!<\/p>\n<h2>Equity and the Owner\u2019s Equity Formula<\/h2>\n<p>Equity refers to the owner\u2019s value in an asset or group of assets. Just like homeowners accumulate equity value as they pay off their mortgage, Owner&#8217;s Equity is defined as the proportion of the total value of a company&#8217;s assets that can be claimed by its owners (whether a sole proprietorship or a partnership). Equity is also referred to as net worth or capital and shareholders equity.<\/p>\n<p>This equity becomes an asset as it is something that a homeowner can borrow against if need be. You can calculate it by deducting all liabilities from the total value of an asset: <strong>(Equity = Assets \u2013 Liabilities)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In accounting, the company&#8217;s total equity value is the sum of owners equity\u2014the value of the assets contributed by the owner(s)\u2014and the total income that the company earns and retains.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider a company whose total assets are valued at $1,000. With a debt of $900 (liabilities). In this example, the owner\u2019s value in the assets is $100, representing the company\u2019s equity.<\/p>\n<h2>Assets = Liabilities + Equity<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an understanding of each of these terms, let\u2019s take another look at the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/a\/accounting-equation.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounting equation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The basic accounting equation is fundamental to the double-entry accounting system common in bookkeeping wherein every financial transaction has equal and opposite effects in at least two different accounts. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This basic accounting equation \u201cbalances\u201d the company\u2019s balance sheet, showing that a company&#8217;s total assets are equal to the sum of its liabilities and shareholders&#8217; equity. This formula, also known as the balance sheet equation, shows that what a company owns (assets) is purchased by either what it owes (liabilities) or by what its owners invest (equity).<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a company wants to manufacture a car part, they will need to purchase machine X that costs $1000. It borrows $400 from the bank and spends another $600 in order to purchase the machine. Its assets are now worth $1000, which is the sum of its liabilities ($400) and equity ($600).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to pay close attention to the balance between liabilities and equity. A company&#8217;s financial risk increases when liabilities fund assets. This is sometimes referred to as the company&#8217;s leverage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Statement of Owner\u2019s Equity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Statement of Owner&#8217;s Equity (also known as a Statement of Changes in Owner&#8217;s Equity) provides an accounting of how a company\u2019s capital has changed during a specified period due to contributions, withdrawals, net income, or net loss. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net income is equal to income minus expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owner contributions and income result in an increase in capital, whereas withdrawals and expenses cause capital to decrease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Net Change Formula<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to calculate the change in the value of anything from its previous values\u2014such as equity, revenue, or even a stock <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">price<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over a given period of time\u2014the Net Change Formula makes it simple. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Net Change Formula = Current Period\u2019s Value \u2013 Previous Period\u2019s Value<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also calculate this change in percentage terms using this formula:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Net Change (%) = [(Current Period\u2019s Value \u2013 Previous Period\u2019s Value) \/ Previous Period\u2019s Value] X 100<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this explanation of the ABCs of Accounting, we will discuss assets, liabilities, and equity, including the Owner&#8217;s Equity Formula, &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":57,"featured_media":919,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[232,11547],"yst_prominent_words":[2049,2656,2058,2050,2047,8082,2305,850,2048,2051,2055,2074],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-right-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"The Accounting Equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity | Fundbox","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Learn the ABCs of accounting.
