From tax preparation to expense reports, employees and owners alike spend hundreds of hours doing tasks they\u2019d rather not.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four tasks you should automate in 2016 so you can spend time running your business instead of babysitting your books.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Invoicing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to lose track of who\u2019s paid you and who hasn\u2019t. Oversights happen all the time. This can create bookkeeping headaches as well as serious cash flow problems that threaten a company&#8217;s credit and court the risk of bankruptcy. To alleviate this problem, QuickBooks accounting software lets you automatically generate invoices, which you can email or print.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, as you&#8217;re waiting for the payment to come in, <a href=\"https:\/\/appcenter.intuit.com\/fundbox?locale=en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a> provides an automated system for sustaining sufficient cash flow. Working in conjunction with QuickBooks, Fundbox lets you select an outstanding invoice and request corresponding funds to repay within 12 weeks. The money is deposited into your bank account automatically as early as the next day. You pay a small fee per invoice for borrowing the amount, and if you repay early, the remainder of the fee is waived.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Inventory<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Taking inventory can consume days of labor from your workforce.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fishbowlinventory.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fishbowl<\/a> helps you cut back on this wasted time by automating your inventory management.
