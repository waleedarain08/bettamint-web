For some businesses, that means you\u2019re stuck in limbo, with not enough capital to grow, even though opportunity is there for the taking. For others, lack of financing can mean the end of their business, livelihood, and dream.<\/p>\n<p>The kicker? Many business owners never understand why they didn\u2019t get the loan. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/insights\/?utm_source=Fundbox&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=rejected_loan\">In a survey conducted by Nav<\/a><\/span>, nearly a quarter of business owners who were rejected for a loan never understood why.<\/p>\n<p>With consumer financing, lenders are required to explain why an applicant was rejected or given less-than-perfect terms, along with the credit score used in the decision. With business credit, lenders may not be required to provide the reason directly, to put the reason in writing or to furnish the score and report used in the application process. To put it simply, consumer financing applicants get a \u201cDear John\u201d letter, while business loan applicants could get \u201cghosted\u201d. (Important note: Not all lenders are equal. Some go above and beyond to help borrowers understand why they were rejected and how to improve their application so they can re-apply.)<\/p>\n<p>Here are some surprisingly common reasons your business financing application may be rejected, and what you can do before you reapply to increase your approval odds.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Your Industry Code Is Wrong<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never pulled your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/business-credit-scores\/?utm_source=Fundbox&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=rejected_loan\">business credit report<\/a><\/span>\u00a0before, you may not even be aware your business has an assigned code that tells lender, vendors and creditors what industry your company falls in. Some lenders consider entire industries too high risk for lending. Examples include weapons retailers, real estate agencies and \u201cadult\u201d content creators. Your NAICS or SIC code could be the culprit of your rejection.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">If it happens to you: <\/span>Your NAICS or SIC code was likely gathered by the lender via your business credit report. If you think your NAICS\/SIC code may be wrong, you can dispute the information with the commercial credit agency. Unfortunately, while you can dispute errors on your consumer credit reports for free, you will need to buy your full report from the business credit agency in order to dispute the items in question.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. You Don\u2019t Have a Business Credit Score<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are more than 44 different kinds of business financing out there\u2014some require a business credit score while others rely on personal credit, revenue, time in business, or a combination of these and other factors. Business owners who know and understand their business credit scores are 41% more likely to be approved.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">If it happens to you: <\/span>If you\u2019ve never checked your business credit profile, you can purchase a credit report from the three major commercial credit agencies\u2014Experian, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, or Equifax. Business credit agencies are not required to give free annual reports like consumer bureaus. If you have no credit profile, it\u2019s because vendors or lenders haven\u2019t reported any of your payment or account activity. You can call those partners and encourage them to report to the agencies, or open a tradeline or credit card with a vendor that does report.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. You Have Too Many UCC Filings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When you get approved for a secured business loan, the lender will often file a lien with your state\u2019s Secretary of State to protect their investment. This doesn\u2019t mean they are actively coming after the assets to recoup repayment, but it gives them the right to reclaim the assets if you default on the loan.<\/p>\n<p>In layman\u2019s terms\u2014it\u2019s like calling \u201cdibs\u201d on the collateral or assets so other lenders can\u2019t go after them if you default on multiple loans.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">If it happens to you: <\/span>Many high-profile lenders will not lend to a business unless they are the only lender with a UCC filing on it or they\u2019re in the \u201cfirst\u201d position. The problem can pop up from time to time when a lender on a loan that\u2019s paid in full forgets to remove the lien filing. It\u2019s surprisingly common and can impact a business\u2019s credit profile for years. Unfortunately, it can take some time (6 weeks or more) to have the UCC filing removed.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. You Don\u2019t Have a Separate Business Bank Account<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s such a simple part of starting a business, but many business owners don\u2019t have a separate business checking account. A business without a separate bank account struggles to get approved. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nav.com\/blog\/70-business-owners-without-business-bank-account-get-rejected-loans-28611\/?utm_source=Fundbox&amp;utm_medium=Content&amp;utm_campaign=rejected_loan\">A recent Nav survey<\/a><\/span>\u00a0found that 70% of business owners without a business bank account had been rejected for a loan in the past two years.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this such an essential for business lenders? Two reasons. First, it can be hard for a lender to judge monthly and annual revenues, cash flow and obligations from a personal checking account that contains business and personal expenses. Second, it can be the best way to judge how long a business has been in business, and \u201ctime in business\u201d is a common underwriting factor for business loans.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">If it happens to you: <\/span>It\u2019s a pretty simple solution: set one up! There are plenty of low-cost options out there and a business bank account will make your bookkeeping and taxes easier to manage as well.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Gg4arrdpv3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-hacks-building-business-credit\/\">6 Hacks for Building Your Business Credit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;6 Hacks for Building Your Business Credit&#8221; &#8212; Fundbox\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-hacks-building-business-credit\/embed\/#?secret=Gg4arrdpv3\" data-secret=\"Gg4arrdpv3\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><i><small>Disclaimer: Fundbox and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice.
