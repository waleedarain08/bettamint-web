If you\u2019re like a lot of small businesses in 2016, you\u2019re no doubt hopeful and perhaps optimistic about growth. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usbankconnect.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2015 U.S. Bank Annual Small Business Survey<\/a>, small business owners are more confident about the future of their businesses now than at any time in the past six years.<\/p>\n<p>This is all great, but how\u2019s your cash flow? Did you run into any issues in 2015? Did you have to forego a large purchase, chase non-paying clients or even delay your accounts payable to overcome a lack of cash? If you plan any growth or even just hope to remain stable in 2016, you need to ensure that your cash flow remains positive throughout the year.<\/p>\n<p>To help you out, here are five cash flow resolutions that can help you plan for and mitigate any cash flow problems in 2016.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Build a Cash Flow Forecast<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Cash flow problems often come as a surprise, so the best way to avoid them is to spot them and mitigate the impact ahead of time. You\u2019ll need to create, maintain, and constantly revisit your <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow forecast<\/a>. This exercise will help you build an operational picture of when cash is due to come in, when it\u2019s due out, and what money you anticipate will be left over. It can account for seasonality, peak-expense periods, and so on. You can also factor in those pesky late-paying clients and how that impacts your cash situation. Check out my tips for <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-create-and-analyze-your-cash-flow-forecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creating your cash flow forecast<\/a> and analyzing your findings.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t stop there. Learn why a <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-small-business-needs-a-cash-flow-statement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cash flow statement<\/a> (which is different to a forecast) can also benefit your business in 2016.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Wave Goodbye to Spreadsheet Financials<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Still using Microsoft Excel for all things business accounting? Excel is fine for some of the basics, but as your business grows, Excel isn\u2019t designed to grow with you. Excel\u2019s limitations become even more apparent when you compare it to the alternative\u2014scalable and intuitive online accounting software with all the reports, dashboards, and tools you need built in. You\u2019ll not only save time, but you\u2019ll spot problems (cash flow issues, late-paying clients) and benefit from a synchronized view all your financial data, including banking, timesheets, invoices, P&amp;L statements, and more. Market leaders for small business in this space include <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FreshBooks<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quickbooks<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xero.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xero<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Read more in <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/manage-your-accounting-with-excel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Reasons Not to Manage Your Accounting with Excel<\/a>\u00a0and then check out <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/switching-to-online-accounting-software-why-and-how\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How You Can Make the Switch to Online Accounting Software<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Make Cash Flow a Priority Wherever You Are <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Another great benefit of making the move away from Excel is that because online accounting tools are cloud-based, you can access them from anywhere and on any device. Even\u00a0if you\u2019re on the road, you can keep an eye on the flow of cash, late payments, etc.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not all! There are a <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-apps-tools-manage-your-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">number of apps<\/a> that help you manage your finances on-the-go. Mobile business banking can help you manage cash flow by setting up alerts to notify you as critical activity occurs, so you don\u2019t have to keep checking your account for important transactions. Expense tracking apps also make it easier to capture your expenses and process them immediately. You can also use tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Square<\/a> to sell and make cash while you&#8217;re out and about.<\/p>\n<p>For more and links to tools that do all this, check out these\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-apps-tools-manage-your-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tools that can help you manage your cash flow on the road<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Manage Your Expenses Like a Pro<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Organizing your expenses is one of the best uses of any small business owners&#8217; time. Sounds like common sense, but I\u2019ve run into business owners who wait until tax time before they log their entire year\u2019s expenses, relying on memory alone!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re at all interested in maximizing your tax deductions, then you need to be all over your expenses as they happen. That starts with understanding what you can expense and what you can\u2019t. For example, did you know that you can deduct not only the cost of the printer ink that you buy at Staples, but the mileage that you incur to get there and back? Make sure\u00a0to separate your business and personal expenses (that means two bank accounts and two credit cards, if possible). Then, of course, there are a range of tools that you can use to track everything as you go.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about all of this, read my blog post: <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/small-business-expenses-to-improve-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Plan for Business Expenses (and Improve Cash Flow)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Shake Up Your Invoicing and Collections Process<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Another small business practice that surprises me is shoddy invoicing, whether it\u2019s only invoicing once a month (or even less), using paper invoices rather than electronic, not chasing late payments, or not having a process in place to deal with tardy clients. Getting paid on time is absolutely critical to small businesses&#8217; success, and this starts with invoicing correctly. It\u2019s something we often write about at Fundbox. Here are a couple of blogs that can help you perfect your invoicing process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-streamline-your-invoicing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">6 Ways to Streamline your Invoicing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/is-the-way-you-invoice-helping-or-hurting-cash-flow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Is the Way you Invoice Helping or Hurting Cash Flow?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If and\u00a0when that invoice isn\u2019t paid on time, here are <a href=\"http:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-direct-yet-diplomatic-ways-to-handle-a-slow-paying-client\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seven direct, yet diplomatic, ways to handle a slow-paying client<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s your new year resolution for your business?
