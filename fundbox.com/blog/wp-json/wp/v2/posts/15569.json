Competition is fierce, so sticking to basic marketing tactics isn\u2019t always enough. If the goal is to generate more B2B sales among new and existing clients, it may be time to harness some of that same creative energy you used to revolutionize your industry\u2019s offerings in the first place to take your small business\u2019s marketing strategy to the next level (thanks to the pandemic, you may be planning to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/update-your-digital-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">update your overall digital marketing strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> anyway\u2014so the time to do think specifically about B2B marketing has never been better).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are four innovative B2B marketing strategies your small business can use now to build client relationships, increase sales, and stand out in the crowd.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customize the client experience with augmented reality <\/span><b>\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, with a large portion of the workforce conducting business at home rather than in an office, it is harder and harder to get your products in front of would-be clients so they can actually see and experience the benefits firsthand before making a purchase. The antidote to this? It&#8217;s an interactive technology called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fi.edu\/what-is-augmented-reality\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">augmented reality<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike virtual reality, which places the user in a virtual environment, AR places a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> environment. This allows said user to visualize, in detail, how the product might appear\/function within their own workspace before they actually make the purchase. Picture a coffee shop owner, for example, \u201ctrying out\u201d a new espresso machine virtually as a way to determine whether it actually fits in the allotted space, or a business manager doing the same with a multifunction copy machine. If your business is one that offers product customization, AR allows you to customize virtually so clients can see what something might look like with these customizations before making a commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An almost <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/augmented-reality-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$18 billion (and growing) global industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, AR is conducted with a smartphone or tablet camera, in conjunction with a web browser and special AR software. The downside to AR? The cost to implement the technology varies significantly based on whether you build your AR tools in-house using a DIY app or hire a pro to design custom software\u2014so be aware that it may be cost-prohibitive for some small businesses, depending on needs and expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><i>AR is one of several<\/i> <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/ecommerce-marketing-strategies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">effective marketing tools for B2C ecommerce businesses<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well.

While this may have been true at one time, research actually indicates that long-form content <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/ebooks\/state-of-content-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gets shared three times more than short-form content<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/search-engine-ranking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more likely to earn a first-page ranking on Google<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might ask, what does this have to do with innovation? Despite these stats, long-form content hasn\u2019t really caught on yet in the B2B world.

You\u2019ll be ahead of the curve if you start incorporating long-form content into your content marketing plan now, before it becomes commonplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What type of content can be long-form?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-form content is characterized primarily by length. CMI defines it as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2020\/04\/long-form-content\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any piece of content in the 2-3K word range<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (anything above and beyond that is considered \u201cextra-long\u201d).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of long-form marketing content include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case studies<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White papers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-books<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guides\/tutorials<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pillar pages (in-depth and lengthy, with lots of links to related content)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equip your website with real-time personalization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200311005240\/en\/Folloze-Research-B2B-Marketing-Sales-Teams-Link\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2020 survey of B2B sales and marketing professionals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that more than half of respondents believe personalization in marketing leads to \u201chigher conversion rates.\u201d At the same time, a considerable portion of them (42%) reported struggling to incorporate personalization into their B2B marketing strategies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are in the struggling-to-incorporate camp, now may be the time to really dive into the process of figuring out how to use personalization in your B2B marketing strategy because, according to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a 2019 report by McKinsey and Company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is expected to be the \u201cprime deliverer of marketing success\u201d by 2024.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One innovative way to make this happen? Through the use of automated tools that customize your website content for each unique set of visitors, otherwise known as real-time personalization (this is just one of many types of personalization in B2B marketing).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, with real-time personalization, your website uses IP addresses, locations and domains to instinctively recognize where various visitors are coming from. Then, it shows these visitors text and images that are most relevant to their businesses (in the form of products, informational blog posts, event announcements, etc.) while simultaneously weeding out content that is less likely to pique their interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this may sound complicated and expensive, you\u2019re in luck\u2014it doesn\u2019t have to be.
