Late nights? No problem. Balancing multiple roles? On it. Working with an almost nonexistent budget? Sounds familiar. Small business owners who want to stretch their budget as far as it can go will appreciate learning about free small business resources. Here are links to some popular business, community, and educational resources that won\u2019t cost you a penny.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Lean on National Small Business Resources<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For expert business advice, you can always trust the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amcanchamber.org\/2017\/12\/22\/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Small Business Administration<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (SBA). Founded in 1953, the SBA provides free small business resources designed to help entrepreneurs pursue their business goals. This is the only cabinet-level federal agency that is entirely dedicated to providing resources for small businesses. Not only do they provide advice and insight on tricky business topics, but you can pursue counseling and capital opportunities through the SBA.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amcanchamber.org\/2017\/12\/22\/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Federation of Independent Businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (NFIB) is a nonprofit group that has great resources for small business owners. NFIB has legal resources and advocates on behalf of small and independent business owners in the U.S. that make a major impact for business owners as a whole nationwide. You won\u2019t want to miss their free webinars that break down complex topics like PPP Loan Forgiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also look for industry specific nationwide resources that touch on your businesses\u2019 more niche needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Look Into Community Resources<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While nationwide business resources are great and often really well produced, pursuing business resources closer to home has its perks. Your local <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amcanchamber.org\/2017\/12\/22\/what-does-a-chamber-of-commerce-do-exactly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chamber of Commerce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> likely provides amazing business resources and they\u2019re a great place to turn when you have location specific questions about things like ordinances and permits. Most communities have a Chamber of Commerce whose goal it is to help local businesses thrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may find that they host networking events with other business owners or plan community events designed to help spread awareness about small businesses in the area. They typically provide free marketing resources to make sure the community can learn more about your business. Not to mention, being a member of your local Chamber of Commerce can lend credibility to your business. Your Chamber of Commerce also likely lobbies local representatives when it comes to fighting for the interests of area business owners, so it can be very beneficial in the longterm to get involved and learn more about what they\u2019re working on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may also be local clubs or Facebook groups created by other entrepreneurs designed to help form connections between business owners that you can participate in. Join a few of these groups and get to know your fellow local entrepreneurs. You never know who may be able to connect you to your next big client or who may help you find the perfect supplier.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Take Free Online Courses<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you start your own business, there is a pretty steep learning curve. One day you\u2019ll get the hang of things, but all savvy entrepreneurs know to always keep learning. Enter: free online courses. E-learning is all the rage these days thanks to how convenient and accessible it is from anywhere in the world. Platforms like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udacity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Udacity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edx.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">edX<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all offer free business classes (note that not all classes on each platform are free) on topics ranging from strategy, to digital marketing, to bookkeeping. It\u2019s time to flex your mental muscles for free! If there is a business area you\u2019re lacking in, don\u2019t shy away from hitting the virtual books, you\u2019ll feel more empowered and have the knowledge you need to make strategic decisions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Have an Online Presence<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting digital doesn\u2019t have to cost a dime. Having a social media presence is free, unless you choose to invest money into advertisements on those platforms. You can also advertise your business on digital resources like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google My Business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/biz.yelp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yelp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> free of charge. These platforms allow you to share key details about your business such as hours of operation and contact info, as well as provide opportunities for your happy customers to leave glowing reviews. Think of customer reviews as word of mouth advertisements on a much larger scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some social media channels even provide free resources designed to help businesses succeed on their platform and to grow their business in general. For example, you can find Facebook business resources through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/resource\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FACEBOOK for Business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This platform offers free resources to help find success on Facebook and Instagram, but also provides more general and topical resources relating to business issues such as COVID-19 relief programs and grant opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Fundbox Small Business Resources<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of your go-to business service providers may offer free resources designed to help your small business get a leg up.
