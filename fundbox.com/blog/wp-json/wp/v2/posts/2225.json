Developing an email newsletter can yield big rewards in terms of branding your business, creating customer loyalty and, of course, sparking sales. Best of all, it\u2019s easier than you may think. Here\u2019s how to get started.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Decide what to include in your newsletter.<\/strong> Your email newsletter needs to provide something of value that your customers and prospects can benefit from\u2014not just advertise your business or offer discounts. You want customers to see your newsletter as \u201cnews,\u201d and open it with a sense of excitement and discovery that they\u2019re going to learn something new. That can include industry news, business news, interviews with you or your employees, product reviews, or even photos or videos of interest to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Primarily use your newsletter to share your expertise in your industry. For example, if you own an accounting firm, you could send a monthly newsletter that includes seasonally relevant tips. In December, you could offer \u201c10 Tips for Year-End Tax Planning\u201d; in May, you could offer advice on \u201cGetting a Jump on Next Year\u2019s Tax Savings.\u201d If you sell IT consulting services, your newsletter could review hot new software (like Windows 10).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Include a call to action.<\/strong> Of course, your newsletter needs to subtly market your business as well. For example, the accountant offering \u201c10 Tips for Year-end Tax Planning\u201d could include the call-to-action (CTA), \u201cMake an appointment today to discuss your 2016 taxes\u201d with a clickable link. Every email newsletter should include at least one CTA\u2014and, in most cases, more than one. Your goal is to get readers clicking through to your website and interacting with your business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get professional help. <\/strong>Don\u2019t have design expertise? No worries. Choose an email marketing service to help you create, design and send out your newsletter. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.constantcontact.com\" target=\"_blank\">Constant Contact<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mailchimp.com\" target=\"_blank\">MailChimp<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Campaign\u00a0Monitor<\/a> are popular services for small businesses.

Monthly is a good frequency for most companies, but if you want to start smaller, try beginning with a quarterly newsletter. However often you send your email newsletter; the key is to send it regularly, so customers come to expect it and so that it promotes an image of stability for your business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make sure you stay on the right side of the law.<\/strong> The FTC regulates email marketing very strictly, so make sure that your email newsletter doesn\u2019t violate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\" target=\"_blank\">anti-spam laws<\/a>.
