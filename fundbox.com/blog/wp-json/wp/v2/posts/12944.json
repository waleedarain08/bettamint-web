Not only does this cause unnecessary stress, she said, it can also hurt your business\u2019 finances. If you lose receipts or documents, you may not be able to claim certain tax deductions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of procrastinating your tax prep, get ahead. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/q2-planning-checklist-must-dos-tax-season-beyond\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Q2<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to review your business financials can help you save money, avoid audits, and set better financial goals. Follow these four steps for ultimate tax preparedness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Review your tax return with an accountant\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s critical to check your tax return for errors before filing, but it\u2019s just as important to review your return <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filing, too. You need to understand the struggles you or your accountant had preparing your tax return, Sjahli said, \u201cso you can improve the process within your business for next year.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the time to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/financial-indicators-review-accountant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ask questions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about your depreciating assets, deductions, refunds, or payments. You may notice differences in your taxable income and profit and loss statement, for example, and it\u2019s important to understand why, Sjahli said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use the review to reevaluate your business\u2019 admin processes or record-keeping methods. If you struggled to track all of your business expenses, for example, ask yourself why. \u201cDo you need to create a new expense category to make it easier for your tax accountant to identify <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tax deductions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?\u201d Sjahli said. Or, maybe you need to invest in book-keeping software.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more knowledgeable you are about your business taxes and financials, the easier it is to make smart financial decisions and identify areas for improvement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Organize and update financial documents\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-things-to-check-off-your-2018-tax-checklist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sorting your business\u2019 financial documents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> now doesn\u2019t just save you time next tax season, it also ensures next year\u2019s taxes are more accurate. \u201cSaving all <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/what-kind-of-records-should-i-keep\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">relevant documents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the freshly filed return is paramount,\u201d Pfaff said. That includes profit and loss statements, balance sheets, receipts, invoices, and canceled checks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you put papers away, revisit your filing system to make sure it\u2019s effective. You can go the chronological route and organize documents by year, quarter, and month, Pfaff said. Or, file them by client, project, or vendor, Sjahli said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you organize files, set aside any you need to update, like your balance sheet and profit and loss statement. It\u2019s helpful to update these to account for your tax refund or tax expenses, Sjahli said. Finally, make sure you store your files somewhere accessible but secure. \u201cSaving documents to a cloud storage drive is an excellent option in the case of loss or damage to onsite computer systems,\u201d Pfaff said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t already invested in accounting software, now\u2019s a good time. Platforms like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QuickBooks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you track your business financials and monitor accounts payable and receivable. Other apps like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.expensify.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expensify<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> let you scan and upload receipts, while <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/stride-mileage-tax-tracker\/id1041591359\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stride<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tracks your vehicle mileage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Schedule tax payments and check-ins<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning ahead can help you stay organized and prevent unwelcome financial surprises. Start by paying your tax bill on time, Pfaff said. \u201cMaking sure you pay or set up a payment plan with the IRS can save you a lot of money in penalties and interest.\u201d From there, he recommended scheduling your quarterly estimated payments to \u201creduce any potential underpayment penalties.\u201d Try adding reminders to your calendar or setting up automatic bank deposits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also a good idea to schedule regular check-ins with your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWhile outside help may seem like an unnecessary expense, a quality advisor is worth their weight in gold,\u201d said Pfaff. \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/find-right-accountant-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with an accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or tax preparer on a regular basis can also help you stay ahead of things that can pop up during the year.\u201d Think: estimating quarterly payments or\u00a0 evaluating short-term funding needs.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Create a financial plan\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work on developing or updating your business\u2019 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/7-ways-to-clean-up-your-financials-before-the-new-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWithout financial planning, your business can lose direction and miss executing strategically,\u201d Pfaff said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by creating an annual budget, then break it into quarterly, monthly, and weekly plans to stay on track, Sjahli said. Include the following in your plan:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Expenses:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Separate this section into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are payroll, rent, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-pay-off-your-business-debt\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan payments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, while variable costs include inventory, utilities, supplies, marketing and advertising, and office updates or maintenance. Make sure to also include one-time expenses, Sjahli said, like the cost of relocating.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Income statement:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Include your business\u2019 revenue, cost of goods sold, and expenses to show how much profit your business is earning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Balance sheet:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> List your business\u2019 assets, including cash, property, accounts receivable, and equipment, as well as your business\u2019 liabilities, which include loan payments, accounts payable, and income taxes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/looked-at-cash-flow-statement\/\"><b>Cash flow statement<\/b><\/a><b>:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Calculate the difference between your business\u2019 outgoing cash flow and cash flow revenue to see whether you have a positive or negative number.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Growth projects: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outline the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/5-ways-spend-tax-refund\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">growth projects<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you plan to do this year, along with their costs, Sjahli said. That might include a deposit for a new office space, upgraded machinery for a big project, or a bulk order of supplies for a new product.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get ahead of your taxes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparing for next year\u2019s taxes now can save you time, money, and sanity.
