Instead, they wait until new technology has been proven before investing in it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Is there a connection between business growth and early adoption of technology?\u00a0That depends.<\/p>\n<p>Companies categorized as fast- or hyper-growth are much more likely than businesses projecting slow or no growth to view technology as \u201cessential\u201d and to be aggressive tech adopters. In contrast, slow- or no-growth businesses are more likely to wait until a purchase is \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that rapid business growth requires greater tech adoption\u2014but it could also be that technology drives rapid growth.<\/p>\n<p>Younger business owners are more likely to be early adopters than older ones, as are owners of bigger businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the top reasons all SMBs purchase technology:<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/0bc9b0c0-5d25-4723-8d53-a8949e4e4264_image2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image Source: The Bredin Report<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The majority of reasons are reactive\u2014just 39% are proactively embracing technology to take advantage of an opportunity.
