It also highlights your commitment to equality and helps promote your business as a leader in the LGBTQIA+ community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we&#8217;ll walk you through the process of getting certified as an LGBTQIA+ owned business and how it can benefit your business moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is LGBTBE\u00ae certification?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTBE\u00ae certification<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is granted by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. The NGLCC is the exclusive, third-party certification body that verifies that eligible businesses are majority-owned by LGBTQIA+ individuals. It also subsequently grants the Certified LGBT Business Enterprise\u00ae (Certified LGBTBE\u00ae) designation to such businesses as part of its<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nglcc.org\/SDI-FAQ#1a\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBT Supplier Diversity Initiative<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This certification gives LGBTQIA+ business owners access to a number of benefits, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A powerful business network of over 200 corporate partners.

In addition, at least 51 percent of the management and daily operations of the company must be controlled by LGBTQIA+ individuals. The application process includes providing documentation to prove both ownership and citizenship.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the benefits of LGBTBE\u00ae certification?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LGBTQIA+ community is a thriving economic driver. In fact, data shows that there is over<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/334983\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3.7 trillion dollars in purchasing power<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the LGBTQIA+ community. In addition, research from the NGLCC found that LGBTQIA+ buyers are 75 percent more likely to change brands if they know they are inclusive of the LGBTQIA+ community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only does LGBTBE\u00ae certification connect you with like-minded business owners and corporate allies, but it also allows your company to tap into a whole host of exclusive opportunities. Some of these include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access to exclusive networking and business development opportunities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free or discounted rates for NGLCC events and webinars.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mentorship and educational programs through the NGLCC network.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discounts on products and services from NGLCC partners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scholarship opportunities through Tuck&#8217;s School of Business Executive Education Program at Dartmouth.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to showcase your commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) to consumers, employees, and partners.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, diversity and inclusion has become a top priority for many American businesses. Gaining LGBTBE\u00ae certification can help you stand out when competing for business opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;ll also serve as a role model for up-and-coming LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs and help pave the way for a more inclusive economy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get LGBTBE\u00ae certification<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applications for LGBTBE\u00ae certification are available online through the NGLCC. There is a four-step application process for businesses that wish to become certified. Application fees are typically waived for any business that is already a member of a local NGLCC-affiliated Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s how to get started.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Fill out the online application<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, create a business profile on<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/my.nglcc.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my.nglcc.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. At this stage, you need to provide documentation to prove that you meet the requirements for certification. The required paperwork must attest that each majority company owner is LGBTQIA+ and that they have control, manage, operate, and possess at least 51 percent of the firm. You can learn more about the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nglcc.org\/steps-lgbtbe-certification\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">specific documentation required for NGLCC certification<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on its website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please note there is a $400 fee (current to the time of this post\u2019s publication) to submit your application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Schedule an on-site visit<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All Certified LGBTBE\u00ae companies must provide site visits to the NGLCC&#8217;s regional certification committees. These visits serve two purposes: First, they provide an opportunity for the committee to become familiar with the business and its day-to-day operations. Second, these visits give committee members a chance to get to know you and your business goals better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site visits are generally 30 minutes long and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Your application will be reviewed<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After your visit, the National Certification Committee will determine your certification status. This process can take up to 90 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Get approved and onboarded<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your application is approved, you&#8217;ll be invited to participate in an orientation webinar. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the benefits of certification and how to make the most of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LGBTBE\u00ae certification for people of color<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intersectionality is a key value at NGLCC, which is why they&#8217;ve committed to promoting LGBTBE\u00ae certification for people of color through the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nglcc.org\/coci\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communities of Color Initiative (CoCI)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
