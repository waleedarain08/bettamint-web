You feel pulled in many different directions, unable to focus on any one thing at a time. You\u2019re anxious and bogged down with stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are you going to get through this while getting things done well and on time?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re interested in learning more about handling stress effectively, you\u2019ve come to the right place. This article provides several methods for dealing with stress\u2014and tips on handling stress when you\u2019re working from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Make a short list<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in handling stress at work is to put away the massive to-do list and focus on what is most important. If you\u2019re wondering how to relieve stress, you may find the answer you\u2019re looking for by simply trying to focus on fewer tasks at once.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try making your own list of three priorities, then focus only on the top item on your list until it\u2019s completed. If your high-priority items are too complex to complete in a day, then you probably need to break them down further into more manageable bite-size tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Call in reinforcements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overwhelming moments are the perfect time to lean on your support network. You may have a partner or team member who can take some work off of your plate, reducing the number of potential stressors in your day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For you, the best reinforcements might come in the form of people who can take on some of your non-work responsibilities (e.g., childcare, cleaning, and running errands). That way, you can focus on your work. In other cases, it might be telling your boss you need a mental health day and asking them to reassign work accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either way, the key is to ask for help when you need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Take a breather<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When things get especially tense\u2014like when you\u2019re putting the final touches on a presentation you have to give next week\u2014sometimes the best thing you can do is walk away.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best stress management techniques is simply giving yourself a 30-minute break (or longer, if needed) to reset your psyche and get yourself centered.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A break can do wonders for perspective, too. Maybe you\u2019re getting stressed out about things that aren\u2019t all that important.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a deep breath, relax, and when the time comes, you\u2019ll be able to deliver a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/how-to-deliver-stress-free-presentations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stress-free presentation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that lives up to the high bar you set for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Turn up the music<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/08\/12\/jobs\/how-music-can-improve-worker-productivity-workstation.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music can boost productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so pick some of your favorite tunes to play in the background while you focus on your three high-priority items.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your line of work, you may find that the louder the music, the more motivated you become. The \u201cpsyching up\u201d period usually happens in just a song or two, so you don\u2019t need to necessarily blast the tunes all day long (thankfully!).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Say \u2018no\u2019 to potential new stress sources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your stress is stemming from simply having too much to do, it may be time to start saying <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more often.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As much as you may want to do everything and be there for everyone, it\u2019s not always realistic. When you reach the critical point when something has to give, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ashiraprossack1\/2020\/10\/21\/how-to-say-no-to-at-work\/?sh=5243e8e04b19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saying <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the only option<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Go for a run<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good sweat can be the perfect way to reset your mood and get yourself motivated to work.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try going for a run, or a walk, or to the gym\u2014anything that gets your blood flowing and forces you to break a sweat.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That way, you can burn off some of the anxiety and come back to work calmer and more focused.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Wait until tomorrow<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all else fails, the answer may be in just leaving it all until tomorrow. This is especially true if you\u2019re <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/sbinformation.about.com\/od\/development\/tp\/avoid-burnout-in-your-small-business.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tired and burnt out<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you reach that point, sleep can help solve the problem. Get a good night\u2019s sleep and come back to your list in the morning when you\u2019re fresh and ready to go.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you recognize the signs of overwhelming stress approaching, any of these tips should help you rein it in and take back control. As you discover more tricks that work for you, create an emergency checklist to keep on your desk so you know exactly what to do next.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handling stress when working from home<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work has always been a major stressor for many of us. But the pandemic compounded this reality even further. As more and more people found themselves forced to work from home for months on end \u2014 in many cases stuck with their children, too\u2014<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/09\/03\/the-stress-of-working-from-home-is-getting-to-most-americans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work became even more stressful<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for many professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep reading to learn some tips and tricks about what you can do to manage stress effectively when you find yourself stuck at home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does working from home reduce stress?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the pandemic, research suggested that working from home could actually be a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.monster.com\/career-advice\/article\/the-benefits-of-working-from-home#:~:text=A%202011%20study%20from%20Staples,as%20well%20as%20eat%20healthier.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stress reliever<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

When you\u2019re working from home, you might struggle to manage your schedule and your time effectively.

Do I really need to take care of this project right now or can I play my guitar for 20 minutes instead? Because they\u2019re stuck at home and miss out on the social aspect of the office, some remote employees also suffer from social isolation. too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you handle stress when working from home?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that it\u2019s possible to manage stress effectively while working from home.
