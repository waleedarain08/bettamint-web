Owning your own company is certainly gratifying, but there are several things you need to be aware of when financing your own firm.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips you&#8217;ll appreciate before opening your own CPA practice.<\/p>\n<h2>4 Useful Tips for Starting Your Own Accounting Firm<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Assemble your own financial plan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;re used to offering financial advice to others, but now it&#8217;s your turn. Assess the costs of starting your own accounting firm and build a financial plan. Initial expenditures may include computers, accounting software, and malpractice insurance. Other expenses to consider are marketing costs, required credentials, and any other insurance you&#8217;ll need to cover your practice.<\/p>\n<p>The plan should also determine your target market and provide a comprehensive vision on how you will oversee the administrative and financial aspects of your firm. Don&#8217;t forget to account for the cash you&#8217;ll need to live on while you wait for invoices to start rolling in. Consider that there may be a few months where you are unable to draw a salary.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Ease into it<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Leaping into full-time entrepreneurship is a big risk. Hedge your bets by starting your accounting firm\u00a0with part-time clients. Start with low-maintenance customers and incrementally take on more work. At some point, you&#8217;ll have so many clients that you no longer have time for your regular 9\u20135.<\/p>\n<p>Another idea is to partner with an established accountant until you can get your own business up and running. Take the clients your partner no longer has time to handle. The benefits of working with an established partner include connections, capital, and new client relationships.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Formulate a hiring strategy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Starting out, be prepared to act as your company&#8217;s secretary, public relations manager, IT consultant and custodian\u2014in addition to its sole accountant. You&#8217;ll also be required to handle all financial aspects of your company from negotiations to contracts. You may work far more hours than you did at a larger firm, but remember you&#8217;re wearing many hats.<\/p>\n<p>Need the funds to hire great staffers?

Clients at larger firms are always looking for more personalized service. Scoop them up and give them the attention they&#8217;re looking for.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As an accountant, you&#8217;re good with numbers, but starting your own accounting firm\u00a0isn&#8217;t simply about being a financial wizard.
