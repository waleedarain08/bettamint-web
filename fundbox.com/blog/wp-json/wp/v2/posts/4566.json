Should you take the risk of fooling your followers with April Fool&#8217;s marketing or play the party pooper?<\/p>\n<p>A funny marketing campaign can build goodwill and deliver clicks to your website, but a digital prank gone wrong can draw groans at best or, at worst, will completely alienate your customers.<\/p>\n<p>This year, an April Fool\u2019s Day prank backfired on Google. The Mountain View-based company had to recall its \u201cMic-Drop\u201d prank on Gmail only a few hours after it launched. The feature allowed Gmail users to &#8220;send and mic drop&#8221; their emails, which automatically attached a GIF of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-pulls-mic-drop-minions-april-fools-joke-due-to-complaints-job-losses-2016-4?r=UK&amp;IR=T\" target=\"_blank\">a mic-dropping Minion<\/a>, an animated character seen in the animated feature film \u201cDespicable Me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the prank \u201csend button\u201d looked too much like the regular send button and many users unknowingly sent the nutty GIF attached to serious business emails to bosses and clients. Some users complained that it even cost them jobs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it looks like we pranked ourselves this year,\u201d Google <a href=\"https:\/\/gmail.googleblog.com\/2016\/03\/introducing-gmail-mic-drop.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a blog post<\/a>. \u201cDue to a bug, the Mic Drop feature inadvertently caused more headaches than laughs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So how do you join in the fun without the regret? Here are the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts involved in a prank-based marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Do: Make sure April Fool&#8217;s marketing humor fits with your brand<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Is your social media feed snarky? Do you post blogs with an attitude? Then you may be ready to build a prank into your marketing campaign. If you want to pull a prank on your customers, make sure the joke is a play on your brand and doesn\u2019t make fun of a competitor or come across as mean.<\/p>\n<p>Does your company have a serious purpose? Best to steer clear of pranks that could be deemed in bad taste.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Don\u2019t: Make a false promise<\/h2>\n<p>Claiming that your company will offer a product or service for free, no matter how outrageous, rarely ever works. Remember <a href=\"http:\/\/simpsons.wikia.com\/wiki\/Stampy\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d episode<\/a> where the radio DJs offer Bart a cash prize or an elephant? Guess which one Bart wanted?<\/p>\n<p>Offering something implausible may seem funny at the office, but when people find out the deal is a prank, it turns them off to your brand.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Do: Drive clicks to your website<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to do something clever, make sure it drives traffic to your website. But remember, if you send out a prank tweet, you\u2019re going to have to follow through with the joke on your website. Make sure you have the time and resources to dedicate to the marketing effort.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Don\u2019t: Take the joke too far<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Remember that April Fool\u2019s Day is funny for, well, a day. Don\u2019t commit to a marketing campaign that takes place for more than 24 hours. You don\u2019t want to answer emails about the prank weeks later.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Do: Keep the April Fool&#8217;s marketing jokes grounded<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The joke will be funnier if people believe it\u2019s true, even if it\u2019s just for a moment. If you offer a product, add a silly bell or whistle to it. Are you a consultant? Email your clients about a service that seems just a little off base. Run your prank idea by a few trusted associates to make sure it\u2019s actually funny.<\/p>\n<p>Happy pranking!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Online April Fool\u2019s Day pranks can be a boon for business or backfire completely.
