Figure out a business name<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first: Once you\u2019ve decided to start a dog-walking business, you need to come up with a name.

It was catchy, it gave her enough flexibility to add additional services in the future, and it was descriptive of the business she was trying to build.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI really wanted to make sure that it was an all-inclusive space where you can bring your pet, whatever their needs are,\u201d Katie says. \u201cThe name tells everything we do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Structure your small business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve got a name picked out, it\u2019s time to figure out how to set up your business. After reading articles and talking to her accountant, Katie decided to set up her business as an LLC.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to how to structure your business, there\u2019s no right or wrong answer.

Understand your market<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before launching your business, do your due diligence to figure out more about your market. Run a quick Google search to determine who your competitors are, what neighborhoods you might want to work in, and what your potential clients are like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this, consider searching for local dog-walking companies using <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/dog-walker-salary-SRCH_KO0,10.htm?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=33ca8e15ddbdefdfc8c7bebc773d61fa5b4dd3dd-1609788553-0-ASobATEezky8prW6UKWLGlaJJoEFXxXMLkHNVxtFgaN5eUUuecAhBXHtR5zE6ReePp4vSANy7F7rPtjrwRku7aAnct4ViNUWPW9rcaHu0X1LKzB9KH7nMZEmOJENGRq6a2RP8zHHCeEe52QhfKxPk7sfDU3rXVt3lVHaz2t2SnGs2s0N0bXG3qEk64XWjoayJjTBs1HwSPpw8FmXUW92QjBGnXntxC21AY6HxjuwwywaepJqtnPfLg6swXrKIRGqPx_P7JbZHBDm96snR7PrV9_wwvoIcCcF34kL05O0ux-4AxoEXQwbaDid4OHDNwVuGvNuxuZ4K08N0jV_P1N2nIwpNnlH6ZNG5lQQHzsBcn0Ge6RP63Om29nOplQ6D-4Xom-AHMbFKyqTInpVnm0YaOBH72ntPK7PjYJvNKfkp3iQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rover.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the nation\u2019s largest network of dog walkers. Head to nearby dog parks and try to chat with dog owners to see what their pain points are so you can begin trying to solve them. You might also consider talking to pet groomers and employees at local pet stores.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try all of these tactics, and you should have a pretty good idea of the market you\u2019re hoping to operate in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Price your services correctly<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After surveying the market, you should have a good idea as to the prices your competitors are charging. Use that information to determine how much you\u2019re going to sell your services for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie\u2019s prices are based on the way she runs her business. Whereas most pet care companies work between specific hours, Paw Inclusive is \u201cmore go with the flow,\u201d and willing to work around client\u2019s schedules. These approaches are not the same, and that\u2019s reflected in the pricing of the multiple packages she offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re just starting out, you need to figure out which kind of business you\u2019re going to be, and price your services accordingly,\u201d Katie says.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Promote yourself<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to succeed, you need to attract customers to your business. To do this, you can create a website to toot your own horn, post your business on online directories, and leverage the social media platforms that make the most sense for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie likes Instagram a lot, too. She recommends spending time searching hashtags (e.g., #newyorkdogs, if you\u2019re in New York), following different people who have pages set up for their pets, and otherwise doing whatever you can to build a trusting online community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, nothing beats word-of-mouth marketing. Katie does her best to give customers delightful experiences in each interaction so that they\u2019re most likely to recommend her business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s another tip: Don\u2019t forget about advertising in the real world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you might decide to invest in a magnetic car sign emblazoned with your company name and logo. You can put these giant magnets on both sides of your car and you\u2019ll become a moving advertisement. You might also want to put up flyers on community bulletin boards (e.g., at the grocery store, coffeeshop, and library).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Obtain dog walking insurance<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yep, you read that right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dog walking isn\u2019t all fun and games. Accidents happen, and dogs will occasionally damage property or even injure themselves or others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For these reasons, Katie says that it\u2019s important that you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Salaries\/dog-walker-salary-SRCH_KO0,10.htm?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=33ca8e15ddbdefdfc8c7bebc773d61fa5b4dd3dd-1609788553-0-ASobATEezky8prW6UKWLGlaJJoEFXxXMLkHNVxtFgaN5eUUuecAhBXHtR5zE6ReePp4vSANy7F7rPtjrwRku7aAnct4ViNUWPW9rcaHu0X1LKzB9KH7nMZEmOJENGRq6a2RP8zHHCeEe52QhfKxPk7sfDU3rXVt3lVHaz2t2SnGs2s0N0bXG3qEk64XWjoayJjTBs1HwSPpw8FmXUW92QjBGnXntxC21AY6HxjuwwywaepJqtnPfLg6swXrKIRGqPx_P7JbZHBDm96snR7PrV9_wwvoIcCcF34kL05O0ux-4AxoEXQwbaDid4OHDNwVuGvNuxuZ4K08N0jV_P1N2nIwpNnlH6ZNG5lQQHzsBcn0Ge6RP63Om29nOplQ6D-4Xom-AHMbFKyqTInpVnm0YaOBH72ntPK7PjYJvNKfkp3iQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">insure yourself and your business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Suffice it to say that well-run dog walking businesses can be quite lucrative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might have to fork over some additional expenses compared to a run-of-the-mill white-collar business\u2014like pet walking insurance and a pet first aid class\u2014the bulk of the expenses will be the same as if you started any business. For example, you\u2019ll have to pay for a business license and a website, and you\u2019ll have to pay to establish your LLC.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you need insurance to be a dog walker?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you might not be legally required to obtain insurance to operate a dog walking business depending on where you live, the fact of the matter is you\u2019d be foolish <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to get insurance. What would happen if a dog got injured or worse on a walk? What if one of the dogs you\u2019re walking bites someone in the park or destroys some property? Without insurance, your business can be crushed financially.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Murphy\u2019s law teaches us, anything that can go wrong will at some point. By getting dog walking insurance, you\u2019re protecting yourself against unforeseen events outside of your control.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I get more dog walking clients?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many different ways to land more dog walking clients. You might start off by asking your friends and family whether they need your services. You can also create a referral program that encourages clientele to refer <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">friends for some sort of incentive (e.g., 10% off their bill for six months). Of course, traditional marketing (e.g., flyers on a bulletin board) and content marketing (e.g., blogs on your website and posts on Instagram) can also be helpful.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re the kind of person who wants to own their own business\u2014and you love dogs\u2014a dog walking business could be the perfect match. Just remember that starting any business is not easy. Even when things are going smoothly, an unexpected event can take the winds out of your sails at any given moment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to protect yourself by forming an LLC, getting appropriate dog walking insurance, and having access to small business financing options that are there when you need them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s to building a dog walking business that serves your neighbors effectively and brings joy to your community!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to start a dog walking business Starting a business is not an easy walk in the park\u2014even when that &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":14,"featured_media":15308,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[326,11546],"yst_prominent_words":[723,7573,1620,1623,3691,8137,1628],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"circle","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Start a Dog Walking Business | Fundbox","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Starting a business is not an easy walk in the park\u2014even when that business sometimes involves actually walking in a park.
