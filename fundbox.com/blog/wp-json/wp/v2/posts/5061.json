That\u2019s great news! Starting a painting business can be a very rewarding venture. But before you pick up your paintbrush and dive straight into painting the best houses on the block, let\u2019s look at what it actually takes to start a painting business. From creating a solid business plan to getting the right team on your side, there are a lot of important steps to take before officially opening your painting business. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is starting a painting business a good idea?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be! If you have the skillset to get the job done right, offer good customer service, and are strategic, then starting a painting business can be a great investment in your future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, opening a painting business doesn\u2019t have too many overhead costs and isn\u2019t too expensive. Starting a painting business shouldn\u2019t cost more than $2,000 to get going. While that is a lot of money, startup costs can be much higher for other types of businesses. Because your startup costs won\u2019t be too high, you will be able to turn a profit fairly quickly once you book your first job.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where you live can play a big factor in how lucrative your painting business can be. If you live in an area with high housing prices and with residents that have extra money to invest in home repairs, then you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble finding work at fair rates. Homeowners associations often encourage and may even require homeowners to refresh the paint on the outside of their homes every few years. This means that if you keep your customers happy, they may keep coming back to you whenever they need a touch up. Drumming up new business is half the challenge, so if you can secure repeat customers, you\u2019ll be off to a great start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much do paint company owners make?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How much you\u2019ll make owning your own house painting business will depend a lot on how you choose to run your business. There\u2019s no one clear answer to the question of \u201chow much do paint company owners make\u201d, so consider asking yourself a few questions that will allow you to gauge your unique income potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you do all of the work yourself or will you hire workers to pick up some of the slack?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many jobs do you plan to take on? Will you be able to invest in advertising?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the demand like in your area?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do other house painters in your community charge?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve decided you want to move ahead and start your own painting business, there are a few things you\u2019ll want to keep in mind.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting Started with Your House Painting Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for the best way to start a business, getting organized is a great place to start. Let\u2019s look at some must-have steps you need to take to learn how to start a painting business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Create a business plan<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you dive into starting a painting business, you need to sit down and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/writing-business-plans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a solid business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can act as a roadmap to success. Having a well-thought out painting business plan can provide clarity and focus, while keeping you super organized. Every good business plan should contain:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Executive summary<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Company description<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Market analysis<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Description of offerings and value propositions<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Marketing and sales strategy<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial plan and profit potential<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Short-term and long-term business goals<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Appendix\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Make it legal<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve written a robust business plan, it\u2019s time to make things official. You\u2019ll want to make sure your entire business is run above board, so confer with your accountant for advice, which may require you to take the following steps to legitimacy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Register your company with your local and state government. Unlike corporations, LLCs or some other legal entities, sole proprietors and independent contractors do not have to register with your state\u2019s office of Secretary of State. However, some states require you to register your business name, such as a fictitious or assumed business name, with your county clerk, registrar or recorder.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Apply for an EIN. This is your business\u2019s \u201csocial security number\u201d and is necessary to file taxes and hire employees. If you\u2019re a sole proprietorship, you don\u2019t have to have an EIN, but you may find you want one. For example, you can use your EIN instead of your social security number as your taxpayer identification number, which can give you some much needed peace of mind if you work with a lot of clients that require you to provide one for tax purposes. Your accountant can point you in the right direction.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Apply for any business licenses or forms of insurance you\u2019ll need to operate your business legitimately and safely. These needs will vary on a state and more local level, so make sure you check in with your local chamber of commerce if you need help understanding what you have to register for. If you\u2019re hiring workers, having workers compensation insurance will be a must.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Find Funding<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can afford to self-fund your new painting business, then you can skip ahead to the next section. But if you need a little help in the financing department (which many people do), then you may want to consider taking out a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/small-business-loans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small business loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to cover your startup costs. Buying supplies, purchasing insurance, paying for advertisements, and hiring staff can all get pricey. Don\u2019t be afraid to look into your financing options to get the ball rolling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Hire staff or contract workers<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re not expecting to paint entire houses on your own, are you? Once you\u2019ve got your business set up, it\u2019s time to figure out whether you want to hire employees or use subcontractors instead. If you choose the former option, you\u2019ll have to buy equipment and supplies for your own workers to use\u2014but you\u2019ll retain control over your business. If you choose to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/paintingbusinesspro.com\/how-to-sub-contract\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">use subcontractors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who are essentially professional freelance painters, you won\u2019t have to buy materials\u2014but you\u2019ll lose some control over your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Find the right supplies<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve decided how you\u2019re going to staff your business, it\u2019s time to stock up on supplies. You\u2019ll need brushes, rollers, painter\u2019s tape, ladders, sanders, caulking tools, rags, cloths to avoid drips and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sherwin-williams.com\/home-builders\/products\/catalog\/categories\/equipment-supplies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You\u2019ll obviously need to buy paint too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Market your services<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You now have everything you need to start painting houses, so start marketing your business. Set up a Facebook page, talk to your friends and family members to see whether anyone they know needs work, and put up fliers around town advertising your business. Once a customer bites, you\u2019ll have to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/paintingbusinesspro.com\/how-to-estimate-exterior-paint-jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide an estimate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the work they need. Formalize an agreement, repeat the process and see how many houses you can paint.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash Flow<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s more to it than just painting houses. For example, like any other small business owner, those who own house painting companies aren\u2019t immune from cash flow problems. When the cash river of a painting business runs dry, you\u2019re unable to buy supplies, market your business and pay contractors and employees. You may have a hard time making insurance and tax payments too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow problems can materialize for a number of reasons, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jobs may take longer than expected. A job you think can be completed in five days might take eight days. This pushes back your other jobs, delaying those payments, too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers might not pay on time. Though in a perfect world, they\u2019d pay you right away, it might be weeks or even months before customers settle their bills.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equipment and supplies may be lost or damaged. A bunch of paint could get ruined or you could lose a box of brushes and other equipment, forcing you to repurchase supplies you hadn\u2019t budgeted for.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An accident could occur. One of your employees could accidentally break a window at a customer\u2019s house, causing you to incur unforeseen expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government regulations may hit your bottom line. There\u2019s a lot of talk these days about raising the minimum wage to $15\/hour. Maybe your business plan is built on the fact you can pay college kids $12\/hour to paint for you during the summer. Should the minimum wage rise to $15\/hour, you could be in a jam.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that you aren\u2019t completely powerless over your cash flow situation. In fact, by taking advantage of new financial tools, you\u2019re able to solve your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/pay-small-businesses-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash flow problems<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014before they start.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conquering Cash Flow and Growing Your House Painting Business<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of spending your time waiting for customers to pay their bills, you can use an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/what-is-invoice-financing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invoice financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> service like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundbox<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get the money you need to grow your business\u2014and fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you connect your accounting software to Fundbox, your business can be evaluated based on the data in your accounting software. If approved for credit, you can choose which invoices you want to clear (up to your credit limit). Fundbox can then transfer that amount into your account as soon as one business day. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You then have 12 or 24 weeks to repay,plus a small fee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most parts of the country, house painters have a short window to operate in: the summer! Given that, there\u2019s no sense in waiting around for checks to come in before you can move on to the next project. Thanks to Fundbox, you might not have to.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thinking about opening a house painting business? That\u2019s great news!
