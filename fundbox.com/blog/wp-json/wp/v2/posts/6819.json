Is it time for your company to take advantage of the trend?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works. Businesses sell outstanding invoices at a discount to a specialized finance company. The business receives a cash payment, while the specialized finance company assumes the risk on the receivables. Accounts receivable financing can help you meet immediate financial needs in addition to boosting your company&#8217;s financial profile and credit rating.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4 Pros to Using Accounts Receivable Financing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Fast Access<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Late payments and unexpected expenses can set your business back so suddenly that it can be hard to recover.

Venture backers require a substantial stake in your company in return for their investment.

Accounts receivable financing does not require equity in your company, so ownership remains 100 percent in your hands.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Small business-friendly<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To obtain a loan, traditional lenders require collateral, a solid credit score, and a capital need of more than $100,000. A bank can take weeks, even months, to verify if your company is creditworthy.<\/p>\n<p>Accounts receivable funding is a type of unsecured financing that doesn&#8217;t require collateral from personal or business assets. Approval only takes a few days, if not hours, and you can request as much or as little financing as you need. <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=business-benefits-accounts-receivable-financing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox&#8217;s<\/a> online application takes only minutes complete.
