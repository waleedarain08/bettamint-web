With all that on your plate, handling potential workers&#8217; compensation fraud\u00a0comes as an especially tough blow because it comes from someone on your own team.<\/p>\n<p>A recent poll from workers\u2019 compensation insurer Employers Holdings Inc. explained that 13 percent of small business owners are \u201cconcerned that one of their employees would commit workers\u2019 compensation fraud by faking an injury or illness in order to collect benefits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The phone survey collected data from a national sample of more than 500 small businesses, each employing fewer than 100 workers. It estimates that fraudulent claims account for at least 10 percent of all claims. It also reported that one in five business owners said they feel unprepared or uncertain of their ability to identify such fraud.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a list of nine warning signs the report recommends business owners should look for if they suspect a workers\u2019 compensation claim might be fraudulent.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. History<\/strong><strong> of possible compensation fraud<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The employee has a record of filing suspicious workers\u2019 compensation claims or a history of frequently changing physicians or jobs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">2. Questionable third parties<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The doctors and lawyers the employee uses have a history of handling fraudulent claims, a reputation for malfeasance, or have been in trouble with the ethical bodies which govern their respective professions.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">3. No witnesses<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The incident occurred off-camera with no witnesses, and the employee\u2019s description of the cause of injury sounds suspicious.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">4. Start-of-shift incident<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The alleged injury occurs either first thing on a Monday morning or late on a Friday afternoon but is not reported until the Monday after.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">5. Conflicting reports<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The claimant\u2019s account of the incident conflicts with the alleged injuries sustained or the medical report.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">6. Late reporting<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Rather than file immediately, the employee inexplicably delays reporting the claim.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">7. Treatment refusal<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The employee refuses a diagnosis to determine the nature or extent of the injury.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">8. Hard to reach<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The claimant does not respond to calls or other messaging attempts.<\/p>\n<h2><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">9. Changes in employment status<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The incident occurred at the end of seasonal employment or the conclusion of a large project, prior to or following a labor strike, or if layoffs are imminent or rumored.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these indicators do not necessarily indicate the situation is fraudulent, but they are red flags for business owners to watch for. The report notes there is no \u201csilver bullet\u201d when it comes to identifying claim-related workers\u2019 compensation insurance fraud. Instead, one should look for a \u201cpattern of events or multiple indicators\u201d before jumping to conclusions.<\/p>\n<p>If you suspect a worker might be filing a fraudulent claim, alert your concerns to the fraud unit or special investigations division of your insurance company\u2019s claims department. Following their investigation, the appropriate law enforcement authorities will be notified if the company deems the claim as suspicious.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running a small business is hard enough\u2014keeping customers happy, maintaining finances, staying one step ahead of the competition, and, all &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":15,"featured_media":4763,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[326],"yst_prominent_words":[723,719,6662,6658,6656,6653,4079,6657,6659,6655,3069,6660,6654,6661,1157,2941,712,6552,1528,6652],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":null,"preview_color":null,"bw_feature":null,"category_color":null},"yoast_title":"How to Catch Workers\u2019 Compensation Fraud | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"It can come as a shock, but business owners should be wary of possible workers&#039; compensation fraud.
