That\u2019s why you would never go a moment without ensuring you have adequate business insurance whether it\u2019s general liability insurance, property insurance, commercial insurance, worker compensation insurance or natural disaster insurances (fire, earthquakes, etc.).<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">According to a recent Forbes article, \u201c75 percent of small businesses don\u2019t have a disaster plan in place&#8230;52 percent of owners say it would take at least months to recover\u201d.\u00a0If you can&#8217;t afford those months to recover from a potential disaster, you may agree that\u00a0putting a\u00a0safety net in place is crucial and important for your business survival.<\/p>\n<h2>Are you Prepared For Unexpected Shortage In Working Capital?<\/h2>\n<p>Similarly, something that many\u00a0business owners don\u2019t think of is unexpected cash shortage that can occur due to seasonality, unexpected late or missed client payments, large influx of orders which cause cash flow issues, unexpected employee theft which require time consuming litigation, etc. All these factors can cause a disruption in your working capital &amp; cash on hand.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, you may not have enough working capital to cover payroll, cost of goods for new client orders, funds for new time sensitive equipment deals, or additional marketing that may help boost your business during peak seasons. One missed deal from a large client order, or the inability to make payroll could result in missed income or expensive lawsuits which could overall have a\u00a0serious impact on business.<\/p>\n<p>As an astute business owner, you&#8217;re already strategically planning ahead. The more risks you\u00a0remove from\u00a0your day to day operations, the higher the chance your business will survive and not become another statistic. Having a disaster plan in place is\u00a0a vital part of that planning.<\/p>\n<h2>A Business Line of Credit as a Safety Net<\/h2>\n<p>Opening\u00a0 a line of credit so you have access to emergency funding when you need it\u00a0is a\u00a0huge step toward de-risking your business activities. A line of credit allows you to access extra working capital in case\u00a0of an\u00a0emergency.<\/p>\n<div style=\"background: #2C3E50; border: 1px solid #fff; color: #fff; padding: 15px;\"><b>Did you know?<\/b>\u00a0Over 70,000 U.S. business owners\u00a0use Fundbox Business Line Of Credit.<br \/>\n<a style=\"color: #3cc5aa; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https:\/\/app.fundbox.com\/signup\">Sign Up Now<\/a> and if approved, draw funds to your bank account by tomorrow.<\/div>\n<h3 style=\"padding-top: 15px;\">What kind of negative situations can extra working capital prevent?<\/h3>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Costly lawsuits from missed employee payroll<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Loss of income from missing large client orders<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing out on great equipment &amp; transportation deals that could further your business<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Missing out on bargain advertising opportunity during high customer demand or peak season<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Think of it almost like free insurance against worse case scenarios that could be detrimental to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Why haven\u2019t you pursued a business line of credit as a safety net?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps you don\u2019t need it right now, or perhaps there\u2019s a lot of time involved in applying for one.
