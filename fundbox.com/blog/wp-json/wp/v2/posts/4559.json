This often makes the difference between dreaming of starting a business and making it a reality. But while there are a lot of perks that come with <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/working-from-home-will-save-you-time\/\">working from home<\/a>, it&#8217;s not without compromise. Working from home can be isolating; it can be boring and uninspiring to face the same four walls everyday; and it can be challenging to find work\/life balance when you live and work in the same environment.<\/p>\n<p>One way to make the most of a work-from-home arrangement is to look for coworking spaces you can use on a regular basis.

Having opportunities for some downtime and a connection to others can do wonders for your productivity and your psyche. Not to mention it can help you keep your <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/improve-people-skills-work-home\/\">people skills<\/a> sharp, even if you work alone.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Reduced Overhead Expenses <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The fees incurred for using a space in a coworking facility are more cost-efficient that what it would cost to rent an office space. In fact, in many cases, coworking can even keep your home office expenses to a minimum. It may be financially worth it to give your home office a break a few days a week.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the best benefits\u00a0of coworking spaces is that they merges together people from different companies with different background and experiences, all working on different projects. Having this vast breadth of experience lays the foundation for learning, growth and inspiration.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Networking Opportunities <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Coworking spaces are culturally collaborative, so even though you may not be there to share work with your office mates, there may be opportunities to create future projects. You may find that you can create networking opportunities with those you work with, resulting in referrals, customer leads, and even new job opportunities.<\/p>\n<h1><strong>Where to Find Coworking Spaces<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>The benefits of coworking sound\u00a0pretty good, don&#8217;t they?
