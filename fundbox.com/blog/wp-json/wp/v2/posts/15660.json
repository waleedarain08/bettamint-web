The costs you incur now can help you determine if you need to secure funding, at what point you\u2019ll break even, and where you can realize savings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the average cost of starting a business can run into tens of thousands of dollars, many small and microbusinesses \u2013 particularly home-based companies \u2013 can get started for much less.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a list of 25+ small business expenses (grouped by category), plus tips for tracking, managing, and reducing your costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Fixed business expenses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed business expenses are precisely that; they remain the same from month to month. These include the overhead of running a business, such as commercial lease payments, mortgage, property taxes, self-employment tax, salaries, loan payments, and business insurance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/fixed-expenses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculating your average fixed expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you understand how much it costs to operate your business and areas where you can save.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed expenses may be tax deductible. For example, you can generally deduct employee pay, insurance, taxes, interest payments, and rent expenses. In addition, if you have a home office that is used regularly and exclusively for business purposes (the dining room table doesn\u2019t count), you can also deduct the fixed expenses associated by claiming the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home office deduction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Be sure to consult IRS guidance on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/deducting-business-expenses\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deducting Business Expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or speak to a business tax advisor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Variable business expenses<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business has expenses that vary from month to month or activity to activity. Variable costs include marketing and advertising, inventory, labor, sales commissions, business mileage, meals and entertainment, gifts, raw materials, maintenance costs, utilities, seasonal hiring, and utilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you operate a restaurant, retail business, or niche business, your variable expenses may typically run higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Overlooked business expenses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always look for tax deductions. You might be surprised at which business expenses the IRS allows business owners to write off.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often overlooked expenses include fixed costs like health insurance premiums. If you pay for healthcare insurance entirely out of your pocket using after-tax dollars (no government subsidies or employer share) you should plan for these and may be able to claim a tax deduction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other costs that often fly under the radar and are tax deductible include mileage incurred driving to meetings or even to the store to buy office supplies (check the IRS website for the latest standard mileage rate, which changes each year).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Variable startup costs like business incorporation fees and the services of a registered agent also play into your budget and are deductible expenses. In addition, if you work with a third-party to help you with legal or accounting matters, you may also write off these expenses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your cell phone bill a startup expense? Yes, if you use it primarily and exclusively for business. However, if you use your cellphone for personal and business use, the IRS requires you to divide the cost and only claim the business use as a tax deduction.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to calculate startup costs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know the business expenses involved in starting a business. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers many <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/business-guide\/plan-your-business\/calculate-your-startup-costs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resources and tools<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can help with these tasks. These include a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/breakevenpointcalculator\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">profit analysis calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (to calculate your breakeven point), <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-08\/Startup%20Costs%20Worksheet-508.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business startup costs calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/tools\/local-assistance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free business counseling.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to track business expenses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking and managing your expenses will help you stay on top of your financial health and prepare for tax season. The first step to doing this is to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/dont-mix-business-personal-finances\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">separate your personal and business finances<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Having a designated business bank account and credit card makes it much easier to record and track your expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracking expenses by spreadsheet is ok, but this method can be hard to scale and maintain accuracy. On the other hand, investing in accounting software and the services of an accountant can help ensure accurate tracking, proper categorization for tax purposes, and report generation.

For instance, you may be able to reduce inventory costs by setting up automatic re-orders when inventory gets instead of keeping excess inventory in stock. Also, talk to your cellphone carrier to see if they can offer a cheaper plan based on usage and your number of employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the biggest expenses for a small business? In most cases, these will be labor, benefits, and taxes. Addressing these costs requires a more aggressive approach. But before you reduce headcount, talk to your tax advisor to find out if you\u2019re overpaying on taxes. You could also consult an employee benefits broker to help develop a custom benefits plan that meets your workforce\u2019s needs while staying within your budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue to make cuts until you\u2019ve reached your target budget.
