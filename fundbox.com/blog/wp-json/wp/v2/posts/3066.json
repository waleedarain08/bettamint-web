Here are five ways to make sure you\u2019re getting the best results for your efforts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do your homework.<\/strong> Start at the source and find out what features and tips LinkedIn offers to help <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.linkedin.com\/\">small businesses grow<\/a>. LinkedIn\u2019s small business experts offer ways to brand, connect, market, sell, build your reputation and more. Plus, you can download free ebooks with detailed information on improving your LinkedIn results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Look like you mean business.<\/strong> The first thing users will see on your Company Page is your logo, header image and \u201cabout\u201d information. If your logo is complicated, it might be time to do a redesign. It\u2019s best to use a high-res, simple and recognizable logo, as the logo will appear next to all your posts. Make sure your \u201cAbout\u201d information is updated regularly. Likewise, make it a point to change your header image periodically to keep your page dynamic. Social media users love images, so use something eye-catching from a recent event or marketing campaign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Go the extra step<\/strong>. <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/company-pages\/showcase-pages\">Showcase Pages<\/a> are extensions of your\u00a0Company Page where you can highlight a new product line or service. You can also use Showcase to create targeted pages for specific clients or customers. But don\u2019t waste your time\u2014Showcase Pages don\u2019t make sense for businesses with only one product or service.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Posts with the most.<\/strong> Yes, it is possible to write a non-boring SEO-friendly headline. Think informative and engaging. Then, post often about your company\u2019s news or trends going on in your industry. Welcome a new hire or a new client and always try to include a call to action\u2014even if it\u2019s just to learn more by directing readers to your website. Better yet, ask a question that\u2019s a conversation starter or take a poll. Look for relevant videos to post to attract our YouTube-crazy culture.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Spend and test.<\/strong> Linked in offers several paid options to enhance your LinkedIn reach. With each solution come analytics to help you determine which method or methods work best for your business.\n<ul>\n<li>Sponsored Posts get more traction by appearing in all LinkedIn feeds, not just those following your company page.<\/li>\n<li>Ad opportunities exist as either straight ads designed and targeted by you and will appear on prominent pages that fall within the parameters of your target audience. These ads are paid on a CPC or CPM basis. You can also use LinkedIn\u2019s Marketing Solutions Display Ads; these guarantee inventory and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a new CRM feature to help businesses find and organize prospects.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is LinkedIn the forgotten stepchild of your digital marketing strategy?
