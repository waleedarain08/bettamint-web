Small business loan alternatives can take <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/your-guide-to-business-financing-options?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=scared-small-business-loan-alternatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your business to the next level<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional lenders make <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/resources\/guides\/funding\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=understanding-your-cash-flow-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business loans<\/a> a scary proposition for small business owners. Banks require collateral, but many young companies don&#8217;t hold much value or have a long financial history. Other reasons small businesses get turned down for loans include a low credit score (under 630 FICO), less than 3 years in business, or a capital need of less than $100,000. Taking all that into account, you may not have a ghost of a chance at securing a traditional loan.<\/p>\n<p>But before you could say &#8220;pumpkin spice latte&#8221; three times fast, alternative lenders have stepped in to fill the void. These new loans don&#8217;t require collateral and are easier for small business owners to obtain.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3 Reasons <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/?s=loan+alternatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Small Business Loan Alternatives<\/a>\u00a0are a Better Fit for Your Company<\/strong><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Flexibility<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Alternative lenders are flexible on loan length, interest rates, and repayment terms. You can find lenders who grant short and long-term loans and some lenders who allow borrowers to repay based on percentage of sales.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to read the fine print. Some online lenders have low interest rates to lure you in, but add on hidden fees or put you on a strict repayment schedule. Other online lenders require daily repayments, and failure to do so can result in higher rates.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Online Access<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your business is thriving in the digital age, but banks still handle business like it&#8217;s 1995. Many traditional lenders still require you to print out applications and supporting documents and fax them over. If you just asked yourself &#8220;what&#8217;s a fax,&#8221; you might be interested in alternative lenders, which allow you to apply online.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=scared-small-business-loan-alternatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundbox<\/a>, the online application takes about twenty seconds to complete.
