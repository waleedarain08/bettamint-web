Given that so many of your fellow entrepreneurs have had some surprising negative experiences, the Alignable survey is a good reminder to do your due diligence when choosing any type of business service partner.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to reading online review and ratings sites to see what others have to say, reach out to other small business owners in your area or industry.<\/p>\n<p>One way to do this is to talk to other entrepreneurs in online communities like Alignable, LinkedIn, and any other social networking groups where you are active. Ask other business owners to share their experiences. Which companies do they rely on, and which do they regret working with?<\/p>\n<p>By asking other business owners in your industry about their personal experiences, you\u2019ll have a good chance of sparking some great network connections while you learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Networking has always been a key way for small businesses to get new customers&#8211;and today, technology has supercharged our ability &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":8888,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[21],"tags":[10147],"yst_prominent_words":[8278,723,719,1132,8276,1976,8279,8281,808,5282,8277,1157,712,709,1126,8275,8274,5217,4486,8280],"post-meta-fields":{"stripe_selected":"bottom-left-curve","preview_color":"yellow","bw_feature":"no","category_color":null},"yoast_title":"Survey: Who do small business owners trust? | Fundbox Blog","yoast_meta":[{"name":"description","content":"Networking has always been a key way for small businesses to get new customers--and today, technology has supercharged our ability to network with others to find trustworthy partners, vendors and suppliers.
