And also common pitfalls to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>Accountant, author, and keynote speaker Geni Whitehouse says the biggest missteps are procrastination and inattention. A large percentage of small businesses, in her estimation, only consider and tackle taxes once a year, in largely reactive fashion. Being more proactive and diligent can uncover additional ways to maximize deductions and minimize tax liability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEvery business decision, from purchasing new equipment to hiring part-time help, can have tax implications,\u201d says Whitehouse, one of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/hypercache.h5i.s3.amazonaws.com\/clients\/1149\/filemanager\/Complete_2011_Accounting_Today_Top100People.pdf\">100 Most Influential People<\/a><\/span>\u00a0according to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Accounting Today<\/span>. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to work with a tax specialist on a continual basis and not just once a year. You need to strategize and adjust as things happen, not after the fact.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Organization and visibility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Good recordkeeping\u2014and the visibility that comes with it\u2014is the key. But many small companies are\u00a0haphazard with their financials, says Jan Haugo, accountant, small business owner, and former CEO of the Institute of Certified Bookkeepers in the United States. In her experience, it\u2019s not uncommon to find receipts in a shoebox, bills scattered across desks, and electronic documents stored in email folders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany are still using Excel, which is fine when you\u2019re getting a company off the ground, but extremely limiting once the company starts to grow,\u201d says Haugo, one of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpapracticeadvisor.com\/note\/12269222\/jan-haugo-2016-most-powerful-women-in-accounting\">Most Powerful Women in Accounting<\/a><\/span>\u00a0according to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">CPA Practice Advisor<\/span>. \u201cEvery business needs full visibility of their financials, and it has to be up to date and all in one place. It\u2019s the only way to make sound tax and cash decisions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Poor bookkeeping can lead to additional mistakes, she adds. Like intermingling personal and business expenses. Or estimating work-related mileage and costs. Or mishandling cash and non-cash revenue.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss out on potential deductions and savings,\u201d says Haugo, \u201cor get flagged by the IRS and face penalties.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAudits are painful,\u201d Whitehouse concurs. \u201cSmall business owners need to think holistically about their tax liability and plan accordingly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Many fail to look beyond income tax, she says, which is another common pitfall. Sales and payroll tax should always be considered, especially when operating facilities, paying workers, or selling products in multiple states. Payroll tax can be particularly challenging, Whitehouse says, with different strategies and tax implications for companies that have employees (W-2 filers), independent contractors (1099 filers), or a mix of the two.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost don\u2019t realize that sales and payroll liability can influence income tax liability,\u201d she notes. \u201cThey can also trigger an audit if they\u2019re not handled correctly.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tools and guidance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>To avoid miscalculation and oversight, both Whitehouse and Haugo suggest a combination of software tools and professional guidance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot getting help is one of the biggest mistakes a small business owner can make,\u201d Haugo claims. \u201cMany think they can do it themselves, and just because they can doesn\u2019t mean they should. Estimating payments improperly, missing deductions, and reporting at the wrong time are all too common.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Platforms like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/\">Quickbooks<\/a><\/span>\u00a0and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">Freshbooks<\/a><\/span>\u00a0can help organize and track a company\u2019s financials, providing visibility across accounts payable and receivable, cash and non-cash revenue, and operational workflows. Whitehouse and Haugo also recommend apps (like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mileiq.com\/\">MileIQ<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for mileage tracking) and services (like <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/\">Fundbox<\/a><\/span>\u00a0for no-hassle lines of credit) that are tailored to small business needs.<\/p>\n<p>Once a company\u2019s financials are consolidated, organized, and up to date, tax advisors can help determine the strategies and tactics that will serve it best.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt some point, small companies need to act like a real business,\u201d says Haugo. \u201cThat means putting systems and processes in place to get a handle on the financials, and seeking help from a tax specialist or financial advisor on a regular basis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s time to reconsider the shoebox filing cabinet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">INFOGRAPHIC: 5 Small business tax mistakes and how to avoid them<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-8718\" src=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min.png\" alt=\"Fundbox 5 Common Tax Mistakes Infographic\" width=\"640\" height=\"829\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min.png 1700w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min-768x994.png 768w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min-1187x1536.png 1187w, https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Common-Tax-Mistakes-Infographic-min-1583x2048.png 1583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><strong><em>About Geni Whitehouse<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Geni Whitehouse, CPA, divides her time between working as a winery consultant at Brotemarkle, Davis &amp; Co in the Napa Valley and writing, speaking, tweeting, and posting at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.evenanerd.com\/\">EvenANerd.com<\/a><\/span>.
