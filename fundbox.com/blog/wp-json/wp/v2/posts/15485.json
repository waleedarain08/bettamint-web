As you pay for business expenses\u2014whether it\u2019s gas for your delivery vehicle or updated inventory management software\u2014take a few minutes to save and file your receipts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For paper receipts, try using a receipt scanning app to upload a digital copy to the cloud. For receipts that come via email, you can either screenshot the receipt or save a PDF copy of it. From there, make sure to label your receipts and file them in easy-to-find folders on a cloud-based drive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Create categories for your expenses.<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to categorize expenses for small business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> costs is crucial. When you organize your expenses into categories, it\u2019s easier to see patterns in your spending, identify unnecessary costs, and figure out how to adjust your cash flow.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by making a list of your various <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/fixed-expenses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fixed and variable business expenses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, then jot down a note or two to describe each one. As you go down the list, you\u2019ll start to see natural categories emerge. Here are just a few examples:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Office: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electricity bills, water bills, telephone costs, office supplies, and office equipment<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Marketing and advertising:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> software subscriptions, direct mailers, website hosting<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cost of goods sold: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">materials, inventory storage, packaging, labor<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 ways to track your business expenses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few methods you can use to categorize and record your business expenses:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1. Create and update a spreadsheet<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re well versed in Excel or if you don\u2019t have a lot of business expenses, you may want to use a spreadsheet to record your spending. You can either create your own tracking sheet or use one of Excel\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">small business expense tracking<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> templates. You may want to include columns that specify the following: type of business expense, amount paid, vendor or company paid, date, purpose for the cost, and any relevant notes or details.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that while tracking expenses via spreadsheet is an affordable, accessible option, it\u2019s not necessarily the most secure or accurate method. It\u2019s easy to make errors when manually inputting information; plus, if your spreadsheet doesn\u2019t automatically update to the cloud, you risk losing vital business information if your computer crashes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2. Hire an accountant<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to take a more hands-off approach to expense tracking, consider hiring a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business accountant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a full-time staff member or on-call consultant. You\u2019d still have to supply your accountant with information, invoices, and copies of your receipts, but the person you hire could\u00a0 take over the daily categorization and tracking, then generate monthly or quarterly reports for you to review.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. Invest in expense tracking or accounting software<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using accounting software, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budgeting apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or tracking systems is one of the simplest ways to ensure accurate expense tracking. Most software platforms integrate with your business bank account and automatically categorize and update your expenses, so you don\u2019t have to spend time inputting information.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but many <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">budget planners<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and accounting systems also generate a weekly, monthly, or quarterly <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expense report<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so you can see real-time data about your spending whenever you want.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To decide which software system will work best for your business, think about your budget, expense tracking needs, and short and long-term business goals.
