The IRS has extended the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/irs-extends-additional-tax-deadlines-for-individuals-to-may-17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">federal income tax filing deadline<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from April 15, 2021 to May 17, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This filing extension gives taxpayers a bit of extra time to file their taxes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The federal income tax extension aside, all other deadlines for filing small business taxes appear to be on schedule for this year. Of course, the kinds of taxes small business owners pay will vary depending on its entity formation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s examine what small business taxes may look like for a limited liability company (LLC). What kinds of taxes can an LLC expect to pay and what are some upcoming deadlines to be mindful of in Q2 and beyond?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>LLCs and \u201cpass-through\u201d tax treatment<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several benefits that come with forming an LLC. An LLC provides its owners with limited liability. This separates and protects personal assets belonging to the business owner in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. In addition, you may be able to build credibility with customers faster as an incorporated business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LLCs are what is referred to as a \u201cpass-through\u201d entity. This means that the profits of the business pass through to the owners (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/single-member-llc-member-managed-llc-whats-difference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also known as members<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). An LLC\u2019s members report profits and losses on their individual tax returns, and not at the business level. The flexibility of a pass-through entity ensures that the LLC is able to legally avoid double taxation. An LLC is taxed only once at the individual level, not twice as it might be under a different entity like a C Corporation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>LLCs and entity classification election<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that while an LLC is a pass-through entity, it may be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/limited-liability-company-llc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treated as a partnership<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the IRS. This is the entity\u2019s default federal tax classification. A single member LLC, for example, may also be treated by the IRS as a sole proprietorship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this does not mean an LLC may be taxed as a partnership or sole proprietorship. The entity must specify how it would like to be classified for federal income tax purposes. In order to make this specification, an LLC must file <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f8832.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 8832<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This allows the LLC to elect to be classified as an association taxable as a specific entity, like an S Corporation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>S Corporation tax election<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, many small business owners will choose to have their LLC taxed as an S Corporation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why elect this status and what kind of impact does an S Corp have on small business taxes? An S Corporation is also a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mycorporation.com\/2019\/10\/forming-s-corporation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pass-through entity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Income passes through to the individual level to avoid double taxation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, LLCs face eligibility requirements before it can set up as an S Corporation. The business must be able to meet certain ownership and stock criteria. Some examples include that the business may not have more than 100 shareholders, that the shareholders are all individual personas, and the business only has a single class of stock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now you have an understanding of an LLC as a pass-through entity, how to elect a different tax classification, and why S Corporations are the preferred tax election. Let\u2019s review some of the taxes an LLC needs to file and the suggested forms necessary for these filings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Small business taxes for Q2 (and beyond)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For small businesses, tax season is not limited to one day each year. Do not focus solely on federal and state income <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fundbox.com\/blog\/important-tax-deadlines-small-business-owners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tax deadlines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Otherwise, an LLC pays income taxes through its default federal tax classification.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Estimated taxes.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is for sole proprietors, S Corporation shareholders, and self-employed individuals that owe $1,000 or more in taxes. These taxes are paid through estimated tax payments. Typically, these payments are made four times throughout the year. The deadlines for the remaining 2021 quarters are April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 18, 2022.
