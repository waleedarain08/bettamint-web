In the meantime, let&#8217;s take a look at three facts showing how women are becoming increasingly powerful in the professional sphere.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><strong> Men still dominate CEO roles at major corporations, but women are increasingly landing powerful positions.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 is dominated by companies that have male CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>According to a list from earlier this year, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.catalyst.org\/knowledge\/women-ceos-sp-500\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only 22 of the 500 CEOs<\/a> in the S&amp;P 500 are women, representing a paltry 4.4%. Some on the list are people you have probably heard of, including Yahoo&#8217;s Marissa Mayer and HP&#8217;s Meg Whitman. But perhaps you didn&#8217;t know that Indra Nooyi heads Pepsi, Marillyn Hewson holds the reins at Lockheed Martin, and Mary Barra is in charge over at General Motors.<\/p>\n<p>While they are vastly underrepresented on that list, women are increasingly landing other top positions within major companies. For example, there were only <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/in_house\/2012\/09\/more-women-general-counsels-at-fortune-500-companies-than-ever-before.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">44 women serving as general counsel<\/a> at Fortune 500 companies in 1999. By 2011, <a href=\"http:\/\/abovethelaw.com\/2012\/08\/a-new-milestone-for-women-general-counsel\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that number had shot up to 108<\/a>, an increase of 245%.<\/p>\n<p>Without a doubt, there&#8217;s still a lot of work that needs to be done to improve these figures. But major corporations appear to at least be heading in the right direction.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong> Women continue to own more and more small businesses.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A recent survey by American Express revealed a ton of encouraging statistics about women-owned businesses in the United States. Here are some of them:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In 2014, there were 9.1 million businesses owned by women in the United States. Together, these companies generated upwards of $1.4 trillion in revenue and employed 7.9 million people.<\/li>\n<li>Women create nearly 1,300 businesses every day.<\/li>\n<li>While the number of businesses in the United States grew 47% between 1997 and 2014, the number of women-owned businesses grew 68% during that same time period.<\/li>\n<li>Between 2007 and 2014, employment at men-owned companies declined while women-owned businesses added 274,000 jobs.<\/li>\n<li>Altogether, women own 30% of all companies in the United States.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Census Bureau reports that <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/free_enterprise\/2012\/10\/women-owned-small-businesses-on-the-rise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">90% of the companies<\/a> owned by women are small businesses.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong> Minority women are becoming small business owners at a rapid clip.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>According to the <em>Atlantic<\/em>, business ownership for minority women <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2015\/04\/women-are-owning-more-and-more-small-businesses\/390642\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has shot up 265% since 1997<\/a>. Now, 32% of all women-owned businesses are owned by minority women. Together, these estimated 2.9 million firms employ 1.4 million people and <a href=\"https:\/\/nawbo.org\/resources\/women-business-owner-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generate $226 billion in annual revenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Are you a minority woman who&#8217;s looking to start a business?
