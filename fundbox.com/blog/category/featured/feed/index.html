In honor of Women’s History Month, we’re highlighting helpful lessons and tips from successful </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/3-ways-women-owned-small-businesses-can-get-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, executives, and entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Identify your purpose</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re running a business, you need to identify your “big why,” said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.christinasjahli.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Sjahli Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that offers virtual CFO services to mission-driven women entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finding your clear sense of purpose enables you to focus on what matters most to you and push forward in the challenging moments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t already identified your purpose, take some time to reflect. Do you want to build a product that makes people’s lives easier? Do you want to create jobs in your community? Maybe you want to offer a service that helps people achieve a specific goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you figure out what’s fueling you, not only are you less likely to suffer from imposter syndrome, Sjahli said, you’re also able to set better boundaries and goals. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to find your purpose:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about why you wanted to start a business. What gets you excited? Who is your business for? What are you trying to achieve? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrow your focus and define your mission.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Embrace the opportunity to grow </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned to always take on things I’d never done before. Growth and comfort do not coexist.” – Virginia (Ginni) Rometty, former CEO of IBM</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not be afraid to make decisions. Do not be afraid to make mistakes.” – Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a thriving business, you have to be willing to take risks and embrace challenges. Getting outside your comfort zone can help you gain new skills, solve problems more effectively, and achieve your goals faster. Depending on your business and background, a growth opportunity could be buying the building next door or figuring out how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitize your services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to embrace growth:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say yes to challenging projects and endeavors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be willing to try new things, whether that means developing a new product or targeting a different customer demographic. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carve out time and resources for one or two company growth projects a year, like launching a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or opening a second store. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Be tenacious</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are committed to creating value and if you aren’t afraid of hard times, obstacles become utterly unimportant. A nuisance perhaps, but with no real power. The world respects creation; people will get out of your way.” – Candice Carpenter Olson, former Co-CEO of Fullbridge</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, dealing with setbacks and hardships is inevitable. In order to overcome the obstacles you encounter—including the challenges unique to women, like gender biases and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/score-report-the-financial-state-of-women-owned-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay inequity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—tenacity is critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe women entrepreneurs must stay resilient and go into each room with confidence like they belong,” said Chynna Morgan, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="http://gifsoutloud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gifs Out Loud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that creates experiential marketing campaigns. Picking yourself up takes practice, but it’s the only way to make progress toward your goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned early that rejection is protection,” Morgan said, “and everything that I went through with my business happened for a reason.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for staying tenacious: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember your purpose and find motivation there. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think creatively about how to use the resources and tools at your disposal. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set boundaries so you have the energy and confidence to continue on during tough times. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Connect with others</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting with fellow entrepreneurs and professionals in your field can boost your business, leading to higher revenue and happier customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find one or two organizations that align with your purpose, join them, be an active member, and provide your own insights and values,” Sjahli said. “Over time, they can be your champions and bring in future leads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to team up with other businesses for product launches or mutually beneficial marketing campaigns. “Don’t underestimate the power of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and collaborations. They can take your company to the next level,” Morgan said. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips for connecting: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join a professional group in your industry. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give back to an organization related to your mission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/collaborate-community-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to other business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your area. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Adopt a learning attitude</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.” – Padmasree Warrior, Founder, President, and CO at Fable</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t succeed in business if you’re not willing to learn. Prioritizing </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-marketing-agency-blogs-follow-inspiration-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts you ahead of the curve. It keeps you humble and adaptable, introduces you to new ideas and perspectives, and helps you stay up to date on industry trends and shifting </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/know-your-customers-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a little bit of effort goes a long way. “Be one percent better every day,” said Sjahli. “Aim high and long-term, but take small steps forward every day.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips to prioritize learning: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get curious about the different aspects of running your business—from product development to customer service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep up with the news in your industry.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask to shadow your employees to learn what they do on a daily basis. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a course or seminar.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up for conferences and events in your field. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Ask for help </span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. Always be cultivating a support network so that when you stumble—and you will—they’ll be there to catch you.” – </span></i><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ladies-get-paid-founder-claire-wasserman-helps-women-entrepreneurs-thrive/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claire Wasserman</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO and Founder of Ladies Get Paid</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a business isn’t a one-person job. Even if you’re a sole proprietor, it’s still crucial to lean on other people for support and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-female-entrepreneurs-share-their-best-advice-for-new-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As business owners, sometimes we believe we’re supposed to have all the answers, but the truth is, asking for help is what makes you a great business owner,” Morgan said. “Knowing your strengths and bringing in people to help you with your weaknesses is vital in building a great company.”</span></p>
<p><b>Tips for asking for help: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask other successful business owners for advice. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-decide-what-type-of-employee-to-hire/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smart, capable team members. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsource work you don’t have the time or bandwidth to take on. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Invest in financial knowledge</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to run a sustainable, profitable business, you have to invest in your own financial knowledge. Understanding your business’s financials is the first step to pricing your offerings correctly, setting realistic revenue goals, planning for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and securing funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth requires you to know your company’s financial health and to have financial visibility of the future,” Sjahli said, “which means you must understand the story behind your balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow.” </span></p>
<p><b>Tips to improve your financial knowledge: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take an active interest in your company’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, revenue, and profit margin.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn how to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set goals with financial targets in mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire a business </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/i-dont-need-an-accountant-this-research-says-you-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building powerful businesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an aspiring entrepreneur or a successful business owner, there’s always room to learn and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Small business owners, on the other hand, eagerly await the Saturday in between those days.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows consumers to support small businesses during a time of year when many could benefit from a little extra support. Their deals may not be as flashy as your favorite big-box retailers, but shopping small can have a huge impact on a small business—especially amidst a pandemic.</span></p>
<h2>What is Small Business Saturday?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, during the Great Recession, American Express created a campaign designed to help support the small businesses that are such vital parts of our communities. The campaign created a movement called</span> <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/shop-small/about/?linknav=us-loy-shopsmall-footer-about"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the campaign encouraged consumers to focus on shopping small while checking off their holiday gift list. The cause was celebrated by shoppers and small business owners alike, and 12 years later, the movement is still going strong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, small business owners open their shops and drive traffic to their websites by offering deals on both products and services that make great holiday gifts. Some neighborhood small businesses band together to create events surrounding their sales, and others run online promotions so you can shop your favorite small businesses from the comfort of your home.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 40px;">Why Shop Small Business Saturday?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the internet, you can now shop with small businesses regardless of your location, but one of the main purposes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was to encourage consumers to shop with local businesses. When you shop locally, you help support both small business owners and your greater community as a whole. Your purchases can help create local employment opportunities, bring tax dollars to your neighborhood, and make it possible for those small businesses to give back to the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you purchase from a small business, you help provide job opportunities. For every 10 jobs that exist at a small business, another seven are supported within the same community. Small businesses also generate two out of every three net new jobs, so shopping locally with a small business can have a big impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every dollar spent at a local small business, roughly 67 cents stays within the community. These contributions go past tax dollars, as many small businesses support local events, sports teams, and charities. The ripple effect of shopping at small businesses goes so much farther than many people realize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you shop small, you’re helping a small business owner realize the rewards of their hard work and determination. You may be giving a parent flexibility while raising their children, or you might be supporting a lifelong passion for the business owner. </span></p>
<h2>Why is Small Business Saturday So Important This Year?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While shopping with local businesses is always important, it’s even more critical now, as many small businesses are still struggling to recover from a challenging couple of years due to the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coronavirus pandemic quickly impacted small businesses. A report from the </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/state-of-small-business-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook &amp; Small Business Roundtable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that within the first month of quarantine, approximately one-third of small businesses had temporarily stopped operating, and just one month later, more than half of small businesses were forced to lay off or furlough employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with brick-and-mortar businesses ready and eager to welcome in-person shoppers once again, a strong consumer showing this holiday season could be just the thing local small businesses need to get back on track. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2021/American-Express-Celebrates-the-12th-Annual-Small-Business-Saturday-Bringing-a-Digitally-Integrated-Holiday-Shopping-Experience-to-Communities-/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express Shop Small Impact survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of small businesses surveyed say this year’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Saturday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is their most critical one yet.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only do you need to figure out how to form your business as a legal entity, you also need to determine how you’re going to market your products and services effectively, who you’re going to hire, and what your ideal customer looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your business starts to grow, more questions come up. When is the right time to expand headcount? When, if ever, is the right time to look for investors or other forms of small business financing, like </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? When should you differentiate your product portfolio? When should you move into a new market? When should you rebrand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list goes on and on, and it never ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you’re not the first person to start and grow a successful business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of trying to figure out everything on your own—and letting the discouragement that comes with things not working out perfectly derail your vision and momentum—why not learn from folks who’ve been in your exact position before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to get some ideas about how to improve your small business, podcasts are the perfect place to find inspiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is our listing of some of the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/28-must-hear-podcasts-business-owners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best small business podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today and why you might want to start thinking about launching your own podcast at some point in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What podcasts do entrepreneurs listen to?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in checking out some of the best business podcasts, you’ve come to the right place. Without further ado, here are 10 of the best podcasts for entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. The Leslie Samuel Show</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a business that depends on digital? Subscribe to </span><a href="https://iamlesliesamuel.com/bloggingwithleslie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Leslie Samuel Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses on how to build resilient online businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie started his career as a high school science and math teacher. He always wanted to teach at the collegiate level, but he didn’t want to get a PhD. So, he created biology videos, posted them on YouTube, and built a devout following—which, ironically, ultimately landed him a professorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward to today, and Leslie’s left the classroom, building an online business to spend more time with his family. The Leslie Samuel Show, which has nearly 400 episodes, can teach you how to do the same. Recent episodes explore how to build sales funnels, how to overcome common entrepreneurial struggles, and how to build a successful digital agency.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Online Marketing Made Easy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Porterfield started out working a 9 to 5 just like most of us. Now, she’s the CEO of a multi-million business. Luckily for you, she shares all of her secrets on her podcast, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/online-marketing-made-easy-with-amy-porterfield/id594703545?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Marketing Made Easy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Amy’s released nearly 400 episodes of the podcast, which gives listeners step-by-step processes they can follow to build incredible online businesses. Tune in to learn more about topics like finding the sweet spot between free and paid content, how to create a high converting sales page, how to re-engage your email list, and whether it makes sense to move to a four-day workweek.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. My Wakeup Call</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Mark Goulston is a psychiatrist, executive coach, and best-selling author. He’s also the host of the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-wakeup-call-with-dr-mark-goulston/id1439752757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Wakeup Call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the name suggests, Dr. Goulston’s podcast highlights instances where people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">woke up </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after an unpleasant experience and improved their lives because of it. To date, he’s released more than 200 episodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent guests include Mike Garson, a Grammy-nominated composer who was David Bowie’s pianist; Lisa Tamati, an ultraendurance athlete and author; and Tim Ringgold, a music therapist and host of the Reduce Your Stress podcast.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beth Buelow is a professional coach, facilitator, mediator, author, and speaker. She’s the host of </span><a href="https://theintrovertentrepreneur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Introvert Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which—you guessed it—caters to folks who aren’t particularly outgoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoiler alert: Just because you’re not an extrovert doesn’t mean you can’t crush it as an entrepreneur. Don’t believe it? Ask </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/23-amazingly-successful-introverts-throughout-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">these famous introverts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Larry Page, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Beth’s aired nearly 175 episodes of her podcast. Recent episodes touch upon how to fully embrace your introverted nature, how to reveal your hidden brilliance, and how to discover your customer’s secret language.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. HBR IdeaCast</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HBR IdeaCast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast needs no introduction. Each week, the fine folks over at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">put out a new episode of the show, which features the best and brightest minds in the business world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, more than 750 episodes have aired. Recent shows focus on what people like David Bowie and Beyonce can teach us about innovation, why it’s time to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with folks instead of simply networking, and how hybrid work is here to stay—and what that means for businesses like yours.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.  The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Vaynerchuk is a CEO, investor, speaker, and vlogger who’s the host of </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GaryVee Audio Experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which has an impressive catalog of almost 2,000 episodes to date. (If you’ve never heard about Gary, take a few minutes to </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbr-ideacast/id152022135?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read about his background</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it’s worth it!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for an eclectic podcast hosted by someone who understands what it’s like to be you, this is a great place to start. Recent episodes focus on why it’s not worth wasting time for a bigger paycheck, why you should never fake who you are, and achieving the perfect blend of patience and tenacity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. How I Built This</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by Guy Raz, </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How I Built This</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an engaging podcast that explores the stories behind some of today’s most successful businesses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just make sure you have time to spare. This is a longer podcast, with episodes usually clocking in somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Masters of Scale</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid Hoffmann might know a thing or two about how to operate effectively at scale. After all, he co-founded LinkedIn, and he’s currently a partner at Greylock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, he’s also the host of the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masters of Scale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> podcast, which explores how businesses scale over 200-plus episodes and counting.

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. The Tim Ferriss Show</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might know him as the best-selling author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 4-Hour Workweek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools of Titans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribe of Mentors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2>Fundbox Forward Podcast</h2>
<p>Also, check out our own small business podcast, <a href="https://fundbox.buzzsprout.com/1030801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fundbox Forward</strong></a>, featuring interviews with small business experts and even Fundbox customers who share their insights on small business.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I start a business podcast?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, not every business needs a podcast. For example, if you own a local </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-i-built-this-with-guy-raz/id1150510297?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">house painting business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/start-food-truck-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food truck operation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your time might be better spent focusing on sales and customer success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, if you’re an expert at what you do and are interested in helping other people follow in your path, a podcast can be a great vehicle to make that happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue the above examples, why not launch a podcast teaching other people how to become expert house painters or food truck owners? You never know when such a podcast might take on a life of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many other kinds of businesses—including marketing agencies, software companies, and even local accounting firms—a podcast might even be a no-brainer. When you record content regularly, you end up with a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/podcasts-videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library of podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that serves as great marketing content your audience can discover at any time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I start a podcast for my business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite what you might think, starting a podcast doesn’t have to be a massive undertaking. All you need is a name, a theme, a good microphone, and a good script to get started. You’ll also need to determine a show format (e.g., will you interview guests or just tell stories?). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re up for the challenge, you should be able to produce your first episode on your own without too many headaches. A word to the wise: If you take this route, the quality might not be where you wished it were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re really committed to podcasting for your business, you might be best off outsourcing production to a company that specializes in podcasts. Record a show, pass it off to the pros for polishing, and get back to do what you do best: serving your customers to the best of your abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you decide, here’s to discovering podcasts that help you get to the next level in your entrepreneurial journey—and potentially launching your own show to inspire the next generation to do the same.</span></p>

Last summer, during a global pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-07b1c7b4-99d3-43b9-9759-a0c54919bdc2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a record number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans applied for new Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) or tax ID numbers, according to Axios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of startups has slowed some since then, there is still a lot of activity around startup businesses making 2021 an excellent time to start a business. And if you need some help regarding how to start your own business and which businesses you should start in 2021, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<h2>Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, you have a list of small business ideas that appeal to you. The idea is to identify those ideas that can become profitable small businesses. Often, startup entrepreneurs are advised to follow their passion. While that might work in some cases, the truth is just because you are passionate about something doesn’t mean consumers will care. The most successful businesses are the ones that offer products or services that consumers (whether B2B or B2C) want at a price they’re willing to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what do consumers want today? Here are a few small business ideas that may be worth pursuing.</span></p>
<h2>B2C Small Business Ideas</h2>
<h3><b>E-commerce</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRF (National Retail Federation) forecasts overall 2021 retail sales to grow between 10.5% to 13.5 %, to between $4.44 trillion-$4.56 trillion. But the more important news is non-store, and</span><a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/retail-sales-now-exceed-444-trillion-2021-nrf-revises-annual-forecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online sales will likely range from $1.09 trillion to $1.13 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an increase of 18% to 23%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Baby products</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The NPD Group, </span><a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/u_s_juvenile_products_industry_grows_6_5_in_2020_reports_the_npd_group/prweb17721091.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parents are buying a lot of products</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for their children. NPD says juvenile-products had revenues of $7.35 billion in 2020, up 6.5% in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular categories were:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety products, including health &amp; grooming products and baby gates. 2020 sales hit $587.5 million, up 35% from 2019.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture sales came in at $952.1 million, up 17% from 2019. Top sellers in this category included cribs, toddler beds, and children’s and baby furniture.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entertainment category, including activity seats/jumpers, and swings, rang up $963.6 million in sales.</span></li>

<h3><b>Toys</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.npd.com/news/press-releases/2021/the-npd-group-u-s-toy-industry-retail-sales-grew-16-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail sales of toys</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to boom, generating sales of $25.1 billion in 2020, up 16%, according to a report from The NPD Group. Many of these sales took place online, boasting an amazing revenue growth of 75% growth from 2019 to 2020. NPD recommends brick-and-mortar retailers continue to offer BOPIS (buy online, pickup in-store) or curbside pickup options since they provide convenience to busy parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion dolls and accessories (+56%), sports toys, including skates, skateboards, and scooters (+31%), games (+29%), building sets (+26%), and summer seasonal toys (+24%) were top sellers.</span></p>
<h3><b>New online customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to <a href="https://startup.unitelvoice.com/ecommerce-website-builders">open an online store</a>, your target market of customers has significantly grown. Running a business online is an excellent side business idea or home business idea. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports baby boom </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/road-to-recovery/2021/01/21/baby-boombers-online-shopping-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consumers over 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are now the fastest-growing category of e-commerce shoppers, joining millions of millennials and Gen Zers.</span></p>
<h3><b>Beauty</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the fastest-growing categories in the beauty industry is products targeting male customers. The personal care market for men “has grown exponentially over the past decade and should </span><a href="https://ablink.editorial.theguardian.com/mps2/c/FgE/AUR8AA/t.2za/-8XbAo24RCSITOSM5FTgAA/h2/L1yYvrz6w4NUEN7AAKQk9-2BZ8njnCJXt9u8lM8bgtmcjLwgTtVRzZ2a0nhAOYgYD0k3IGiAGeCnkfxA0oLPQWe9EJQifoMCnrRDq9YTXc7yPAQVBqC75GKCfsAwZgKvMBlm1tJZ62DKeWO-2FMtDE9i7SGspyppu4cXm3FnoksHT5-2FyIFePJhWtMk2jDOgEX7GH-2FypQoUIBRGyvyuCzIVJcdTsDw9eSCyEq-2Fm-2BMX24C65b2B3pF89enI0RevGBtMoZfGF5LuE8bMYBfiPTiqKegn3nqWLIQ9kXGz8Lhpzk7jRoPr-2B5Jw3QifODuh9Ev1GHQJHSHSs1k6lYg0TOM0S-2Bbzy4ZmDFIKbQaYMpYJojUu-2Bg-3D/7--V"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit $166 billion</span></a><a href="https://ablink.editorial.theguardian.com/mps2/c/FgE/AUR8AA/t.2za/-8XbAo24RCSITOSM5FTgAA/h3/L1yYvrz6w4NUEN7AAKQk9-2BZ8njnCJXt9u8lM8bgtmcjLwgTtVRzZ2a0nhAOYgYD0k3IGiAGeCnkfxA0oLPQWe9EJQifoMCnrRDq9YTXc7yPAQVBqC75GKCfsAwZgKvMBlm1tJZ62DKeWO-2FMtDE9i7SGspyppu4cXm3FnoksHT5-2FyIFePJhWtMk2jDOgEX7GH-2FypQoUIBRGyvyuCzIVJcdTsDw9eSCyEq-2Fm-2BMX24C65b2B3pF89enI0RevGBtMoZfGF5LuE8bMYBfiPTiqKegn3nqWLIQ9kXGz8Lhpzk7jRoPr-2B5Jw3QifODuh9Ev1GHQJHSHSs1k6lYg0TOM0S-2Bbzy4ZmDFIKbQaYMpYJojUu-2Bg-3D/CmnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” according to Allied Market Research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And per a report from CBS News, global research firm Mintel reports </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/male-makeup-is-catching-more-mens-eyes-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds of Gen Z males</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. are interested in gender-free beauty products, and not just products in traditional masculine packaging (dominated by deep red, green and black colors). According to Mintel, “9% of Gen Z males say they use some form of lighter, ‘no-makeup’ makeup, whether it’s tinted moisturizer, BB cream or CC (color correcting) cream.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, in the beauty industry, all the buzz is about clean beauty. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clean beauty market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to grow from revenues of $5.4 billion in 2020 to $11.6 billion in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean beauty means the products are safe and non-toxic.</span></p>
<h3><b>Home improvement</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likely due to the increased number of people working from home, many decided to </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spaces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to consumer research giant </span><a href="https://brandessenceresearch.com/consumer-goods/clean-beauty-market-size" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NPD Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020, consumers invested their home improvement dollars in their kitchens and baths (revenues were up 28%), while overall home improvement revenues rose 22%, and paint sales increased 16%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means there are opportunities for businesses that sell these home products. The outlook is also strong for contractors and remodelers. According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, which issues the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) report, forecasts remodeling industry revenues will reach </span><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/press-releases/home-remodeling-set-stronger-growth-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$352 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, since many of us will be working from home for the foreseeable future, entrepreneurs selling organizational products or services are in high demand.</span></p>
<h3><b>Food trucks/ghost kitchens</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve always wanted to be in the food business, but the startup costs are too high, consider starting a food truck business or launching a ghost kitchen. Ghost (or virtual) kitchens thrived during the pandemic. They offer take-out and/or food delivery only and often can operate in less costly parts of a city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=3slWLw94I3jq-2B-2FedjFNgZA6lfN8-2Fc97iz7gquTp96XxiM8zX5vuEoiqGxTGsZDA97Aqp-2Bcj6sJYbLXRmu8Nzm8LaOl1TJn1eLtcDYWIioTw-3Dnf5S_dS0-2BUOGLGfm-2FZwhlLNY0jNAYK679fWlON-2B9lmycs5T3BmSbOZokpdb6MQmJSTy3kn2N1cnBHp06IaXmeVL-2B80ti4seJnL9YytXN7-2FgHMfSZJmJLGt-2FrTlRs-2BJBbnGoeZDWAYJd0fn2FXatGGHVLMTZU8fOGicWR3sPO50KgQ0u1ktTkARwGlEiDiFjZ75yEvUwEfvVX-2BBcvLtGpR3Fsbo7jQ21pu8mkK9f4BWauv3zQjFmnItmamZKX1fd7wmwRLTvbfufQvZ8V1sSXnoQ8BvkmFnjJOS-2FqTXVp7OtRxeYhMrf21vyAGnC2J4iG0DDWwC4KOlpt-2FiYpqQQRohCb8oQ-3D-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from industry insider, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">QSR Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said this about quick-service restaurant operators (QSRs): “You can see the appeal. Virtual kitchens are stripped-down commercial cooking spaces with no dine-in option. Functioning as hubs for online delivery and catering orders, they circumvent the need for costly buildouts in premium locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less prime real estate also means more space to accommodate delivery and catering vehicles that would otherwise jockey with customers for parking space.</span></p>
<h3><b>Tutoring</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tutors are in great demand today, and starting a tutoring service is a great side business idea. </span><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Private-Tutor-Salary-per-Hour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ZipRecruiter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports private tutors are averaging sales of nearly $45,000 a year.</span></p>
<h2>B2B Small Business Ideas</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All those new startups are going to need help launching and growing their businesses. This means there’s a lot of opportunities for businesses that serve other businesses (B2B). Business services in demand include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountants and bookkeepers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic designers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business plan writers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translation services</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media consultants</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual assistant</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Business formation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you decide on what type of business you want to start, you need to take care of the details. Of prime importance is </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/sole-proprietor-or-incorporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choosing the business formation structure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s right for you. If you don’t want to incorporate, the simplest and least costly option is to operate as a sole proprietor. If you don’t </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/register-business-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register a separate name for your business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in your state, your first and last name will become, by default, your company’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you run a sole proprietorship, there is no legal shield between you and the business. That means you can be personally sued by unhappy clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many business owners are starting an LLC (limited liability companies), which are considered a separate legal entity from its owner/s, which means they’re protected from personal liability for any debts and claims on the business. If you own an LLC, you are required to keep your</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-expenses-taxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">business’s finances and expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> separate from yours or other members of the LLC.</span></p>
<h2>Which is right for you?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each business structure has its pros, cons, and tax consequences, so before choosing the one that’s best for your company, consult with your accountant and attorney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your small business will eventually provide working capital solutions to your customers, learn how to become a Fundbox partner to utilize our </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/partners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform for embedded finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

You also need to</span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-retain-millennial-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">retain these employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you fail to keep them around, you might find yourself in a vicious cycle of hire-train-repeat (an endeavor that can be costly, time-consuming and aggravating).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things you, as a small business owner, can do to avoid this vicious cycle is to help your employees stay motivated. Not only are motivated employees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happier</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees, they are also less likely to say “I quit” in response to on-the-job challenges and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likely to consistently produce high-quality work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, exactly, does it take to motivate? It really all comes down to a few enduring motivational techniques. Here are five reliable ways to motivate the people who work for your small business so that they, in turn, will give your business the best that they’ve got.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Provide freedom and flexibility to your team members</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether your team is remote or working on site, the level of motivation among individual employees is bound to be higher if they don’t feel trapped by a micromanaging boss who demands a detailed account of how they spend their time each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than concerning yourself with how many hours people are spending in front of their computers, allow them to structure their workweeks as they see fit. Does someone need to leave at 3pm to take a child to soccer practice, or put in a few extra hours on Wednesday and Thursday so they can take Friday afternoon off to tend to a personal matter (the scenarios are endless, but you catch the drift)? No problem, so long as they are holding up their end of the bargain (i.e. getting all of their work done on time). They’ll appreciate the autonomy and, in return, are that much more likely to spend their working hours in a state of focus rather than a state of clock watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service-oriented businesses may find this concept less feasible, considering you can’t exactly allow retail employees or receptionists to come and go as they please. However, that does not make this motivational technique null and void for such businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider letting employees request the days and hours they want to work rather than simply assigning shifts and time slots. Let them choose when they take their breaks. Be gracious if they need to make changes (even if those changes are sometimes last minute, because emergencies happen) and make sure they know whom to notify or talk to about needs related to their scheduled work hours.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Trust your employees to do their jobs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the same lines as providing freedom and flexibility, trusting them to do their jobs is a key piece of the motivational puzzle. Assuming you made great hires, they probably don’t need an overseer keeping tabs on them or telling them how to complete their work. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t provide tools and training when tools and training are needed (you should!). It simply means your employees will feel more motivated to do great work if they believe that their boss considers them capable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practically speaking, one way to let your employees know that you trust them is to avoid looking over their shoulders all the time, demanding that they follow your processes and methodologies. Instead, concern yourself with the final product,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">assuming that whatever processes and methodologies they choose (within reason, of course) will lead to the results you want. As long as expectations are clearly communicated, a positive outcome is probable.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Show appreciation and recognize achievements</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By showing appreciation, we are not referring to a quick ‘thx’ text message sent in response to “the report will be delivered by 5pm.” We’re talking about those small but tangible things you can do to truly make your employees feel valued, like treating them to coffee, offering an extra personal day, sending flowers on their birthday, or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating employee appreciation day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The options are endless and they don’t have to be grandiose. All they have to be is genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you’re at it, take note of the fact that employees are also highly motivated by receiving recognition for a job well done. Did someone knock that presentation out of the park? Win over a tough-as-nails client? Solve a stubborn technology problem? Let them know you noticed. Whether that involves something as basic walking over to their desk and telling them you how much you appreciate their hard work or something as major as giving them a promotion and a raise is up to you, but the fact of the matter is you are more likely to see results like this again and again when their achievements are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledged</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> again and again.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Give employees jobs that matches their interests and skills</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you hire a new employee and they inadvertently wind up doing tasks that aren’t listed in their official job description (which they may or may not appreciate). Sometimes, time reveals that your sales assistant’s skills are more on par with a sales </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manager</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> role or that your customer relations coordinator, despite a rock-solid work ethic, isn’t a good fit for a job that involves direct communication with customers. Regardless of the specifics, keeping someone in a job that doesn’t suit them, or one they have outgrown, is a surefire way to destroy motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remedy? Make sure all of your employees are in the right roles. Promote when the time is right, reassign people to other jobs when necessary and listen to what your employees are saying about their ideas and work-related goals. The other option, letting people languish in positions that aren&#8217;t right for them, is pretty much a guarantee that you’ll either lose good employers to other jobs or have a team full of discontented folks who are constantly counting down the minutes to the weekend.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Compensate your employees fairly</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Seattle business owner made headlines several years ago when he decided to phase in a $70K per year minimum wage for all employees, something that led to a significant salary increase for many of them (he cut his own salary from $1.1 million </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $70K to help fund the new pay scale). Evidently, this action resulted in higher levels of productivity and job satisfaction, across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, of course, is an extreme case (few small business owners have the budget to establish this sort of compensation program). However, the reported success of this program makes the point that employees are often more motivated to do good work if they feel they are being paid fairly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make this a reality among your employees by staying on top of your industry’s salary trends and making sure the compensation you offer is in range (because underpaid employees are bound to lose motivation, sooner rather than later).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge? Competition is fierce, so sticking to basic marketing tactics isn’t always enough. If the goal is to generate more B2B sales among new and existing clients, it may be time to harness some of that same creative energy you used to revolutionize your industry’s offerings in the first place to take your small business’s marketing strategy to the next level (thanks to the pandemic, you may be planning to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update your overall digital marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anyway—so the time to do think specifically about B2B marketing has never been better).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are four innovative B2B marketing strategies your small business can use now to build client relationships, increase sales, and stand out in the crowd. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customize the client experience with augmented reality </span><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, with a large portion of the workforce conducting business at home rather than in an office, it is harder and harder to get your products in front of would-be clients so they can actually see and experience the benefits firsthand before making a purchase. The antidote to this? It&#8217;s an interactive technology called </span><a href="https://www.fi.edu/what-is-augmented-reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">augmented reality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike virtual reality, which places the user in a virtual environment, AR places a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">user’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environment. This allows said user to visualize, in detail, how the product might appear/function within their own workspace before they actually make the purchase. Picture a coffee shop owner, for example, “trying out” a new espresso machine virtually as a way to determine whether it actually fits in the allotted space, or a business manager doing the same with a multifunction copy machine. If your business is one that offers product customization, AR allows you to customize virtually so clients can see what something might look like with these customizations before making a commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An almost </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/augmented-reality-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 billion (and growing) global industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AR is conducted with a smartphone or tablet camera, in conjunction with a web browser and special AR software. The downside to AR? The cost to implement the technology varies significantly based on whether you build your AR tools in-house using a DIY app or hire a pro to design custom software—so be aware that it may be cost-prohibitive for some small businesses, depending on needs and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>AR is one of several</i> </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">effective marketing tools for B2C ecommerce businesses</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. If you’ve ever shopped for a car online or visited a virtual dressing room to try on jeans, you’ve probably seen it.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiment with long-form content</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you’ve heard that blog content is supposed to be short, punchy and straight to the point. While this may have been true at one time, research actually indicates that long-form content </span><a href="https://www.semrush.com/ebooks/state-of-content-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gets shared three times more than short-form content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to earn a first-page ranking on Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask, what does this have to do with innovation? Despite these stats, long-form content hasn’t really caught on yet in the B2B world. As of 2020, only </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38% of marketers in the B2B space were using it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Content Marketing Institute. You’ll be ahead of the curve if you start incorporating long-form content into your content marketing plan now, before it becomes commonplace.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of content can be long-form?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-form content is characterized primarily by length. CMI defines it as </span><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2020/04/long-form-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any piece of content in the 2-3K word range</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (anything above and beyond that is considered “extra-long”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of long-form marketing content include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case studies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White papers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-books</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guides/tutorials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillar pages (in-depth and lengthy, with lots of links to related content) </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equip your website with real-time personalization</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200311005240/en/Folloze-Research-B2B-Marketing-Sales-Teams-Link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 survey of B2B sales and marketing professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that more than half of respondents believe personalization in marketing leads to “higher conversion rates.” At the same time, a considerable portion of them (42%) reported struggling to incorporate personalization into their B2B marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are in the struggling-to-incorporate camp, now may be the time to really dive into the process of figuring out how to use personalization in your B2B marketing strategy because, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2019 report by McKinsey and Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is expected to be the “prime deliverer of marketing success” by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One innovative way to make this happen? Through the use of automated tools that customize your website content for each unique set of visitors, otherwise known as real-time personalization (this is just one of many types of personalization in B2B marketing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, with real-time personalization, your website uses IP addresses, locations and domains to instinctively recognize where various visitors are coming from. Then, it shows these visitors text and images that are most relevant to their businesses (in the form of products, informational blog posts, event announcements, etc.) while simultaneously weeding out content that is less likely to pique their interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may sound complicated and expensive, you’re in luck—it doesn’t have to be. Many automated personalization tools, such as</span><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize-360/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Optimize 360</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are competitively priced or, in some cases, even free. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a podcast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week, </span><a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68 million Americans listen to podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While comedy is the most popular genre (no surprise there), plenty of people are interested in listening to informative business and educational podcasts, hosted and/or created by leaders in their respective fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this adds up to an enormous and potentially game-changing opportunity for you as a small business owner. For one thing, while podcasts are certainly growing in popularity, the market is nowhere near saturated—especially in niche areas like B2B (</span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/why-podcasting-matters-to-marketing-infographic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to one source, collectively a mere 3% of marketing pros were podcasting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of March 2020).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasting is also:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple to navigate, with fewer constraints on access compared to some other media channels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable (you can create a podcast without a large financial investment)  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to establish credibility as a subject matter expert in your field</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450637/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful for branding and relationship-building purposes</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A way to generate ad revenue</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to discuss on a B2B podcast? Keep in mind that podcasting is really just an extension of your existing content marketing efforts, so refer to your existing content for inspiration. You can also interview important figures in your field, share company news, discuss the history of your business&#8217;s niche, really anything at all that your clients (and potential clients) might enjoy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="young woman entrepreneur stands smiling in front of her desk" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/shutterstock_1571215153.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How, exactly, does someone become an entrepreneur? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some individuals instinctively know that they want their careers to follow an entrepreneurial path. They may go to school for an MBA or find that they have a knack for starting businesses as early in life as a childhood lemonade stand. Others find opportunities in entrepreneurship out of necessity. During lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals started small businesses. This allowed them to pursue their passions and earn a profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, others discover entrepreneurship with a “Eureka!” moment for a new product or offering. Take the example of businesswoman Sara Blakely. Years ago, Blakely </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sara-blakely/how-sara-blakley-started-spanx.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut the feet out of her control top pantyhose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to wear under a pair of pants to a party. Voila—the pants had no visible lines underneath. This remixed take on a traditional shaper allowed Blakely to create the patent for the shapewear we now know as Spanx. Today, Blakely is one of the world’s most famous entrepreneurs!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does someone reach that point and decide that they are ready to become an entrepreneur? The best way to get started answering this question is to discover your why.</span></p>
<h2>Discover your why</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you want to become an entrepreneur? Your “why” is the reason you want to start a business. One of these reasons below could be your “why” as an entrepreneur. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to make a difference in your community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You dream of turning your passion into your life’s work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have an idea for a new offering or service that you know will change people’s lives.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You enjoy learning by doing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re ready for a challenge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re passionate about finding your purpose.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as you know why, you’ll be ready to start setting short- and long-term goals for your startup.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need to start a business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting a small business is no easy undertaking. There are plenty of challenges presented to those that commit to becoming an entrepreneur. However, if you know what to expect ahead of time you will be prepared to address each one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the most common challenges facing entrepreneurs in 2021 and suggested solutions for overcoming these issues.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes you qualified to start a business? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have several years of existing experience in the field. If you don’t have enough experience, or what is considered the right experience, consider upskilling. You can do this by enrolling in relevant online courses, watching webinars, and listening to podcasts to learn from experienced individuals. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner or solo?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you start the business on your own or would you like to go into business with a partner? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that being in a partnership requires both partners to work equally together. Having a </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2021/05/business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written partnership agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be a big help in smoothly running the company.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you wear many hats?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur, particularly in the early days in your startup’s lifecycle, means you will be doing the work of several people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it can be difficult to manage this much work especially if it is outside of your skill set. If hiring full-time isn’t a feasible option right now, consider outsourcing work to contractors or freelancers that have the skills to complete it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you acquire customers?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business idea should be viable and for an offering or service that customers actually want (and will pay for!). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start conducting market research to determine your target audience and establish buyer personas to better understand your demographics. You may also collect customer feedback through focus groups and surveys conducted via social media and in e-newsletters.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will the business receive funding?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fund the business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are planning to quit your job to start a business, you’ll need a significant financial cushion to become an entrepreneur and attend to your finances and expenses. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/the-best-loans-and-resources-for-veteran-entrepreneurs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may include financing from investors, taking out a business loan, applying for grants, using crowdfunding platforms, or attracting the interest of an angel investor or venture capitalist.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does work/life balance look like?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is true that becoming an entrepreneur means putting plenty of energy, time, and commitment into the business and its idea, the end result should not be one where you feel completely overwhelmed or burned out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider starting your small business as a side hustle before making the plunge to take it full-time. Use this time to grow the business and observe how you are able to maintain work-life balance. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a scaling strategy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As sales rise and your business enjoys a steady influx of cash flow, consider putting  together a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-entrepreneurs-reveal-how-they-scaled-their-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This may help  ensure your business keeps growing its revenue through its business model and may allow you to expand into new markets over time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful tools for entrepreneurs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur requires having an entrepreneurial toolkit. Here are some of the most critical components to include in your toolkit for success.</span></p>
<h3>Create a business plan</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/create-a-business-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will act as the foundation for which you can build your business. Think of it as a roadmap to becoming an entrepreneur. You may use a business plan to set goals (both short- and long-term) for your business to reach and set timelines to get to these goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business plan allows you to detail more about who you are and what the business does. You may use this space to analyze your competition through an industry analysis and your customers through a market analysis. A business plan allows you to share the financial projections of your company and outline a funding request from potential investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that a business plan may be revised over time. Take note as you reach certain goals—and begin planning for how to reach your future goals.</span></p>
<h3>Incorporate or form an LLC</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating or </span><a href="https://blog.mycorporation.com/2020/08/sole-proprietors-form-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forming an LLC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business is one of the best tools an entrepreneur has in their business toolkit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating as a business entity, like a limited liability company (LLC) or corporation, provides your business with limited liability protection. This creates a separation between your personal and professional assets. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, your personal belongings will not be impacted or used as collateral. Additionally, incorporating a business can provide tax benefits and allow you to establish credibility faster with consumers.</span></p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurship is not meant to be done alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need a network of the best and brightest in your corner. Some of these people may include mentors, close family members and friends, and other entrepreneurs that you admire—and that admire you in return! Remember to build your network as much as you continue to network and grow the business.</span></p>
<h3>Act with confidence</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur is hard work, but it is also rewarding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are doing it! You are working to create an offering or service that will change the lives of others for the better by bringing  this idea to life.

Examining your business’s numbers and measuring your performance is key to solving problems, making more informed decisions, and setting yourself up for steady </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-barriers-to-small-business-growth-and-how-to-break-through-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does data matter? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you regularly gather and evaluate company data, you gain greater insight into how your business functions on both a big-picture </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granular level. More information at your fingertips means you can be more strategic and proactive as a business owner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewing data makes it easier to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify your business’s patterns and blind spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out your company’s strengths and weaknesses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve revenue/sales</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage with customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop more effective </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain cash flow </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set realistic goals</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 types of business data to pay attention to</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless metrics you can measure as a business owner, but most of them fall into four key areas: marketing, finances, customer experience, and sales. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Marketing data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without consistent, strategic marketing, your business’s growth can stall. That’s why it’s crucial to regularly review your marketing metrics to see what you’re doing right—and what you can improve upon. Here are three areas to focus on: </span></p>
<p><b>Website analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business website is full of valuable information about your marketing tactics. When you look at the analytics, pay attention to the total number of visits per month, the amount of pages visited, and the website bounce rate, which indicates how quickly visitors leave your site. It’s also smart to analyze your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-ways-boost-blog-traffic-budget-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources—like email, organic search, and social channels—so you can see which distribution channels are bringing in the most traffic. </span></p>
<p><b>Social media analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying active on social media is a good way to brand your business and attract new customers. On each of your business accounts, make sure you record the number of followers you have, as well as the amount of likes, comments, clicks, and shares your content gets on each platform. The more engagement your content has, the better your visibility and post reach.</span></p>
<p><b>Email analytics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating tailored email marketing campaigns is one of the most effective ways to get in front of current and potential customers. Whether your business sends out email newsletters, promotions, or transactional messages (or all three), it’s important to track your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/8-ways-boost-email-open-conversion-rates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Knowing how often subscribers open your messages is the first step to figuring out how to tweak your emails for better engagement. You should also look at your email list growth rate and click-through rate, which show how often new people subscribe and click the links in your emails. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Financial data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your finances are the foundation of your entire operation. Getting familiar with your financial data doesn’t just give you a better idea of your company’s overall profitability, it can also make it easier to budget properly, maintain healthy cash flow, and hit your sales and revenue targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your business accountant should carve out time each month to look at your income statement, balance sheet, and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s also worth tracking the following: </span></p>
<p><b>Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business expenses can reveal a lot about your company’s operational efficiency and cash flow. </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/fixed-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which include costs like rent, employee salaries, and insurance, stay the same from month to month, while variable expenses fluctuate. Examples of variable costs include inventory, utilities, and marketing and advertising. Tallying up your fixed and variable expenses will tell you how much it costs to run your business. </span></p>
<p><b>Net profit margin: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your net profit margin shows how much of your business’s revenue translates to profit. To calculate it, start by figuring out your net income using this formula: </span><b>Net income = Sales/Revenue &#8211; Cost of goods sold &#8211; Expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From there, you can calculate your net profit margin percentage: </span><b>Net profit margin = (Net income / Total sales) x 100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your net profit margin is low, you may want to consider  increasing  your revenue by selling more, raising your prices, or cutting expenses. </span></p>
<p><b>Revenue growth: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue growth is a good indicator of how steadily your business is growing. Looking at how your revenue changes from month to month or quarter to quarter can help you make more accurate sales forecasts. To calculate your revenue growth, use this formula: </span><b>Revenue growth percentage = (Current period’s revenue &#8211; Last period’s revenue) / (Last period’s revenue x 100)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Customer experience data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying competitive comes down to improving your business’s customer experience. Analyzing customer experience data is key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/innovative-ways-attract-new-customers-keep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawing new customers in</span></a> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> satisfying the ones you already have. Here are a few metrics to consider:</span></p>
<p><b>Customer retention rates: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retention rates show you how many customers you’re maintaining, while churn rates show you how many customers you’re losing. Rather than looking at your retention and churn rates in isolation, consider what’s normal for your industry, then look at how your rates change over a period of time. If you’re consistently losing customers, you may need to examine your products, adjust your pricing, or evaluate your customer service. </span></p>
<p><b>Customer reviews:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Customer reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide valuable qualitative data about your customers’ likes and dislikes. Pay attention to your total customer reviews, your average rating, and the amount of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment in the feedback you get. </span></p>
<p><b>Net promoter scores: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A net promoter score (NPS) is a simple, effective way to measure your customers’ satisfaction with your business. You can send out email surveys to figure out your company’s NPS or install a website pop-up asking customers to rank their experience on a scale of one to 10. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Sales data </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to understand your sales metrics and results in order to refine your sales strategies and reach your quotas. Start by looking at the following: </span></p>
<p><b>Qualified leads: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualified leads are the people most likely to become your customers. Tracking the number of qualified leads your business has is a good way to determine whether or not you’re targeting the right markets. You can assess qualified leads by counting the number of people who visited your website, added a product to their cart, or clicked a link in one of your emails. </span></p>
<p><b>Lead to conversion rate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead to conversion rate, which shows how often </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/turn-warm-prospects-hot-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">qualified leads turn into paying customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can tell you how effective your sales strategies are. You can calculate the conversion rate using this formula: </span><b>Conversion rate = (Total number of new customers / Total number of leads) x 100</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From there, you can work on improving conversion by retraining your sales team or adjusting your sales funnel. </span></p>
<p><b>Yearly sales growth rate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Looking at your annual sales growth rate gives you a better idea of how your business is progressing from year to year—and what you can do to improve. The formula is: </span><b>Yearly sales growth rate = (Current year’s sales &#8211; Last year’s sales) / (Last year’s sales x 100)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ahead with data</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluating data is a powerful way to see into your business’s future, but you need the right </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do it. Website analytics platforms, customer relationship management software, and accounting software make it easy to track tons of different business metrics. Plus, certain platforms and tools generate weekly and monthly data reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which method you choose, though, it’s important to track a variety of metrics over a significant period of time. One data point doesn’t tell much of a story, but data from a handful of different areas can paint a more complete picture of your business’s health and growth potential. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics indicate that business owners are taking advantage of Instagram’s clout—</span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of businesses use Instagram to at least some degree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Perhaps more importantly, </span><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% of Instagram </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">users</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning consumers with personal Instagram accounts) turn to the platform for information on products and services before making a purchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes everything from doing research on products and services to getting the particulars on promotions and sales to finding links to websites and contact information. All add up to a potential goldmine for small business owners interested in </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updating their digital marketing campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ecommerce-marketing-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proven e-commerce strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply being on Instagram (e.g. signing up for an </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram business account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) isn’t going to get you very far, though. You need to actually use it in a way that will pay off. How can you do this? Multiple factors are involved, but one of the most important factors involves your followers. Not only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is following you (although that can be important, too), but how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are following you as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does it matter? That’s because followers beget </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">followers, along with more shares, more visibility and ultimately (hopefully!) more sales. Learning how to gather followers isn’t necessarily instinctive, but once you know the ropes it will feel like second nature. Do you have just a handful of followers, or are you working with a sizable list of actively engaged folks who regularly view your posts?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it is the former, here are four actions you can take now to increase the number of your small business’s Instagram followers:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Use hashtags strategically and effectively</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hashtag may appear to be nothing other than a random word or phrase with a pound sign in front of it. In reality, hashtags are your business’s best friend—at least in terms of getting an influx of Instagram followers. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the purpose of hashtags?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashtags provide a chance to connect your business to a cause relevant to your brand, a promotional opportunity or a trending topic by catapulting a post into the search results related to said hashtags so your business is easier to find (the sheer volume of content on Instagram means a lot of great posts get buried without them). When an Instagram user enters a search term preceded by a hashtag into the search field, posts that include that hashtag will appear (coffee connoisseurs may search for #espresso, whereas someone planning a vacation may search for #travel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you can research hashtags that apply to your business and include them in your Instagram posts to increase the potential for views, likes and additional followers (examples include hashtags like #nationalsmallbusinessweek or #smallbusiness). You can also create custom hashtags for special events (like a seasonal sale), and advise customers to search for and follow those hashtags on Instagram.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many hashtags should you use?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of hashtags you use in a post is all up to you, and that decision will depend greatly on the hashtag protocols in your industry. Instagram’s hashtag limit is 30 per post. You certainly don’t need to take it that far if you don’t want to, but you may want to consider using at least one—</span><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/instagram-stats-every-marketer-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data supports the idea that posts with hashtags receive more consumer engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than those without. The sweet spot? Around five hashtags per post.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: To help establish brand recognition, create a hashtag specific to your business name and/or brand and encourage followers to use it when mentioning your business in posts.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Invest in Instagram ads</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve never considered capitalizing on the power of </span><a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram advertising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now may be the time to give it a try if one of your objectives is to gain more followers. Often more affordable than traditional forms of advertising, like radio or print, Instagram offers a lot of flexibility in terms of how you format your ad. You can take an existing post and morph it into an ad, you can produce ads in Instagram Stories, you can create shoppable posts and so on. </span><a href="https://www.webfx.com/how-much-does-social-media-advertising-cost.html#instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost to you, as the advertiser, is click- or impression-based and varies a lot depending on several factors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do ads help increase your follower count? Instagram uses algorithms and data to target folks who show interest in products or services like yours, even if they aren’t already following you. As they scroll, your ad appears. Not all will follow you but, thanks to targeting, some probably will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Tip: Another advertising option?</i> </span><a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-sponsored-posts/#:~:text=An%20Instagram%20sponsored%20post%20is,account%20for%20a%20lucrative%20career." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsored posts</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This involves partnering with (i.e. paying) an influencer to promote your products or services in their own posts or stories. Because their followers presumably consider them a credible source, their endorsement may result in more followers for you.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Host contests and giveaways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram users love contests and giveaways and, as a small business with an Instagram business account, it may be worth your time to sponsor one. Why? Because a contest/giveaway provides an opportunity to quickly and easily gain followers. Contests and giveaways also allow you to engage with your current followers in a way that encourages them to help you spread the word about your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting one up isn’t hard. It all starts with determining what it is you want to give away and setting contest parameters (be aware that </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/179379842258600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram has several rules about contests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you’ll need to adhere to). Since your goal is to gain followers, however, you’ll want to make sure that those parameters help get you there.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few ideas:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage followers to tag a friend for an additional contest entry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the contest open to followers only.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborate on the contest with another business or influence (cross promotion for the win). </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Engage with followers (and potential followers)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you do this yourself, maybe you hire a social media manager to do it or maybe you assign the task to an employee. In any case, one of the best ways to increase your Instagram following is to actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram as the communication tool that it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This starts, of course, with posting regularly, but it doesn’t end there. You also need to make sure your followers know you actually see and hear them. How?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reply to their comments, questions and concerns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone tags your business in a post, thank them in the comments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow them back—especially those that like and/or comment on your posts regularly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comment on other users’ posts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regram” (i.e. share) posts that you think may interest your followers (unlike Facebook and other social media apps, Instagram doesn’t make this easy—</span><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/how-to-repost-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll need to use a third-party app or take a screenshot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you want to share another account’s post).</span></li>
