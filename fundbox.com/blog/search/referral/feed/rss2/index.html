The value a good accountant can offer your business cannot be overstated. It’s one of the most important decisions you can make for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A qualified and reliable accountant can help you handle dynamic and ever-evolving tax laws and navigate circumstances that could help you to scale your business in the most optimal, efficient, and economical ways. Choosing the right accountant can help you take your business to the next level; choosing the wrong accountant can be counterproductive to your business’s health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s vital that you know what to look for in a business accountant and put in the research to ensure you choose a professional who is the right fit for your business. Here are five tips to help you choose the best accountant for your small business.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand your needs </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hire an accountant, you should first have a basic understanding of what you want the accountant to do for you. Do you need someone to handle bookkeeping and financial statements? Or an accountant to help you prepare and file your taxes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bookkeeper or non-certified accountant can help with day-to-day accounting; however, if you require someone to provide strategic tax advice, file your taxes, or assist with an audit, you might be best off choosing a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Understanding the responsibilities and work you need help with, and how often, is an important step toward finding an accountant. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seek referrals and reviews</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you friends with other entrepreneurs or part of a small business association or network in your community? One way to discover a dependable accountant for your business is to ask for recommendations from your peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, you might also conduct a Google search to find accountants in your area. You can also seek out online reviews and use them to compare and evaluate prospects. LinkedIn, Yelp, or other online communities like Reddit and Facebook may also be helpful resources for referrals and reviews that could inform your decision.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate their qualifications and experience </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reputable accountant should have the qualifications and experience to support their knowledge and expertise. It may be in your best interest to look for an accountant who has experience working with other businesses in the same industry as you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be beneficial because they are likely to be familiar with the needs, challenges, and tax laws specific to your business type or industry. Training and formal qualifications will determine the type of accountant you can hire and the services they can provide. Here are some qualifications to look for in an accountant: </span></p>
<h3><b>CPA certification</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certified public accountant, or CPA, is an accounting professional who has passed the CPA exam and maintains the necessary qualifications to be a licensed CPA. All 50 states have different CPA licenses, and requirements for certification vary by state. In addition to the exam, applicants often need to have a bachelor’s degree and two years of experience in accounting. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has a </span><a href="https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic/findacpa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can use to find CPAs, accounting companies, and local accounting organizations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Certified Management Accountant (CMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMA is an accounting designation that signifies expertise in financial accounting and </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strategic-management.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The certification is sponsored by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA). Candidates must have a bachelor&#8217;s degree and two consecutive years in management accounting or financial management. </span></p>
<h3><b>Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CGMA is a global certification issued by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) for CPAs who work in business and government. This certification distinguishes professionals who have advanced proficiency in finance, operations, strategy, and management.</span></p>
<h3><b>Enrolled Agent (EA)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EA credential recognizes professionals, including CPAs, licensed by the government to represent taxpayers. They advise clients, prepare personal and business taxes, and deal with the Internal Revenue Service on matters related to business or personal tax audits. The certification is awarded by the </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/enrolled-agents/enrolled-agent-information#:~:text=An%20enrolled%20agent%20is%20a,as%20a%20former%20IRS%20employee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Other certifications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many additional accounting certifications that recognize specific skills. These include Accredited Payables Manager (APM), Accredited Payables Specialist (APS), Accredited Receivables Specialists (ARS), and Certified Payroll Professional (CPP).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet with prospective candidates and ask questions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve conducted your initial research and compiled a list of a few prospects, it’s time to conduct a series of meetings or interviews with them. This is your opportunity to ask questions and gain a better understanding of how they work. Of course, you might find the answers to some of these questions with a little online research, but it’s still a good idea to spend a few minutes with a prospective accountant to get a better idea of whether they might be the right fit for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few questions you might ask prospective accountants: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What accounting qualifications and training do you have?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of accounting services do you offer?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your fees and how do you charge? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What types of clients do you work with? Do you have experience with other clients in my industry? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What technology or software do you use? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you support my goals? What additional value could you offer my business? </span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider how they’ll help your business grow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to weigh your options and carefully consider if the accountant you’re considering will be the professional whose financial advice will help you make successful long-range decisions for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some accountants will simply focus on completing the task at hand. They will fill out tax returns and manage your accounts, while others will be more proactive in handling your finances. When you are choosing a business accountant, you should always ask what recommendations they have for saving your company money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business succeed. Before you choose your small business accountant, you should consider how this professional relationship will ultimately help contribute to, support, and guide your business growth. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to look at an accountant as an integral member of your team. After all, they can play a pivotal role in the success of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best accountants will be able to share thoughts about processes that could be put into place to help your business thrive. On the flip side, an inexperienced or otherwise unqualified accountant can be extremely counterproductive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure you </span><a href="https://1800accountant.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose the accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is the best fit for your business, be selective and take your time with the decision. Ultimately, you want to choose an accountant who is within your budget, reliable, reputable, dedicated to supporting your goals, and committed to helping you scale your business (if that’s part of your business plan) and save money. </span></p>

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 million job openings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country this summer, marking the highest number ever on record. With more jobs available than people searching for them—and with </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of Americans quitting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—small businesses are struggling to find and hire new employees.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To capture the attention of job seekers in the current climate, business owners need to stand out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer the right incentives. Here are four smart ways to attract qualified candidates (beyond just posting a job ad):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Expand your online presence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business’s online presence takes upfront work and consistent effort, but it’s an effective way to draw potential employees in. These four strategies can help your business become more visible and memorable. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Post frequently on LinkedIn: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn is the platform for job hunting and referrals, so it’s a good place for employees to learn about your business. In addition to posting job ads and industry updates, you may want to spotlight employees, feature positive customer reviews, and share your business’s accomplishments or achievements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tap into social media: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-tips-planning-social-media-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the easiest ways to get in front of prospective employees. When you’re brainstorming post ideas, think of how you can get job candidates excited while staying authentic to your brand and style. If you run a bakery, for example, you could share a behind-the-scenes video of how you make your croissants. If you operate a dental office, you could make an infographic that breaks down your employee benefits and workplace perks. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Improve your website:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your business’s website is usually the first place job candidates visit when researching an open role, so it’s crucial to make a positive impact. Start by revamping your landing page so it’s visually intriguing, scannable, and informative. Next, update your “careers” page with more information about your business, workplace culture, and employee benefits. You may also want to update your business’s “about” section or include relevant keywords throughout your site to improve SEO.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Alert the presses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive press can pique the interest of job seekers. Consider writing a press release to announce good business news, like an expansion or new product launch. You could also reach out to local news outlets to pitch a story about your business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Share job ads with niche communities </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posting a job ad on a job search website is like shouting into the void; your post can get buried under thousands of other similar ads. Instead of relying solely on job search sites, make an effort to show up in the places where prospective employees spend their time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by listing out the skills, qualifications, and experience level necessary for the roles you’re hiring for. From there, research activities, communities, and groups that line up with the skills and qualifications you outlined. For example, if you need hard-working summer staff for your beach cafe, you could post a flyer at a nearby high school. If you’re looking for employees with basic medical knowledge to work at your orthopedic practice, you could share your job ad in the local university newsletter or campus pre-med Facebook community.   </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Lead with your values and workplace culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees today have higher expectations for the businesses they work at. The </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">majority of employees want three things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a 2021 McKinsey report: a better work-life balance, more flexibility, and more emphasis on well-being at work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To attract job candidates, it’s important to explain </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/employee-appreciation-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what you can offer employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beyond a paycheck. On your business website, in your job ads, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your online platforms, work on the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Share your business’s values: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees want to work for companies that align with their beliefs and support causes they care about. By openly discussing your business’s values and bigger purpose—whether it’s to expand education or support your local community—you can attract job candidates who will be excited and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motivated to work for you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Highlight your workplace culture: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describe your unique workplace culture on your website and in your social media posts and job ads. Maybe you give employees flexible arrival and departure times, for example. Or maybe you encourage everyone to share ideas in company meetings or take a certain amount of time off every quarter. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Revisit your compensation structure and benefits package </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter how often you post on social media or how widely you distribute your job ads—if you don’t offer competitive compensation and attractive benefits, you’ll have a difficult time filling open positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restructuring your compensation and benefits offerings may require you to drastically change your budget and company policies, but taking action now can pay dividends in the long term. Here are three tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consult your accountant: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To figure out what you can realistically offer current and potential employees, start by examining your finances. Meet with your </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/accountant-can-business-cant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ask what’s feasible. Can you bump up the base salary for certain positions, for example, or give quarterly bonuses to employees who reach specific sales targets? It’s also important to look at industry standards and check out what your competitors are currently doing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/equal-pay-employer/"><b>Ensure pay equity</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider hiring an outside expert to review your compensation plan for equity and inclusivity. An expert can assess whether there are any pay gaps, then give you practical recommendations for resolving them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Reevaluate your benefits:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to a 2020 study from MetLife, a comprehensive benefits package is the </span><a href="https://www.metlife.com/content/dam/metlifecom/us/ebts/pdf/MetLife-Employee-Benefit-Trends-Study-2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">number three driver of employee well-being</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To reevaluate your offerings, do some industry research or survey your employees to ask about their needs. Then consider what you can offer in addition to health insurance. The possibilities are endless. Think: extended disability leave, stipends for mental health services, reimbursements for fitness subscriptions, paid lunches, and additional vacation time.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining employees </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding qualified employees to fill the gaps in your business can be tricky—which is why it’s critical to put just as much effort toward </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-ways-to-increase-employee-retention-in-your-small-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as you do recruiting. Once you hire your employees, aim to do the following: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest time in proper onboarding and training, so employees understand their roles and responsibilities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly check in with employees to find out what they need. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give employees opportunities to grow professionally and personally. </span></li>
</ul>

If you’re not prepared for downtime, you can lose cash flow, customers, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> momentum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are practical ways to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/6-important-steps-to-running-a-successful-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set your business up for success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here are six steps to take to prepare for your slow season: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Organize your finances</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding your business’s financial situation is key to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/9-ways-to-manage-cash-flow-in-a-seasonal-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeping your operation alive when cash is tight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you have a clear picture of your cash flow, annual sales forecast, and expenses, you can create a more realistic budget and allocate your spending to the right expenditures. It’s a good idea to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/find-right-accountant-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet with your business accountant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to go over the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cash flow: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a cash flow forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to figure out how much money you have to work with during your slow season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list of your </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;oq=fundbox+blog+fixed+expenses&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i299.3165j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fixed expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and variable expenses to see what you need to save—and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-cut-expenses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where you could potentially cut costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You want to ensure you have enough cash to cover your rent, business website, debt obligations, payroll, and equipment maintenance. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sales or revenue forecast: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on your data from last year, estimate how much revenue you can generate during the slow period. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Financing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider whether or not you need financing. You might need a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/line-of-credit-vs-credit-card/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help cover ongoing operating expenses, for example, or a term loan to buy inventory in bulk before your busy season ramps up again. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Get rid of extra inventory</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inventory you carry during your business’s high season can quickly become a burden come the slow season. Depending on the products or services you offer, excess inventory either means wasted revenue potential or extra storage costs—and sometimes both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offloading extra inventory gives you the chance to earn money on slow-moving stock, make the most of products with a short lifespan, and save on storage fees and future marketing expenses. Here are a few ways to get rid of inventory ahead of a slow period:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create promotions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling items for a discount or limited time only can help you reduce inventory fast. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Bundle products: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair slower-moving stock with one or two customer favorites, and sell the package for a slightly higher price. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Re-market inventory:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> See if you can alter your products slightly, or market them to a different group of customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Return inventory to a supplier: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to your supplier to ask if they’ll let you exchange or return unsold inventory. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sell inventory to another business: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the type of inventory you carry, you may be able to sell extra materials, parts, or products to another business at a discounted rate. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Donate your inventory: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the value of giving away your inventory versus paying to store it. You could donate products or supplies to a nonprofit organization, a local school or shelter, or a small business that needs a boost. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Brainstorm off-season revenue streams</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can find a way to keep the cash coming in when demand is lower, you might save yourself stress during the slow season. First, consider your business model, financial goals, and bandwidth. If you have the time and resources to add another revenue stream to your business, then you can start brainstorming possibilities. Here are just a few options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Turn your service into a product: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting out a valuable product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help satisfy customers and net you a bit of extra cash. If you run a business that provides ski lessons, for example, you could create and sell an online workout guide with videos and tips to keep skiers in shape during the off-season. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Experiment with a subscription model: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can bring in extra cash by giving your customers the option to sign up for a subscription. Customers could pay a monthly fee to get access to your services year-round, for example, or pay monthly in order to score discounted rates on services. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Partner with other businesses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to local businesses or complementary online companies to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/leveraging-strategic-partnerships/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do cross-promotions or strategic partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Sublet your business space: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t need your building, storefront, or office for a few months, try subletting it out to another business. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Check in with your customers</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to maintain your business—especially before a slow period—is to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-enhance-customer-experience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focus on customer retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After all, it’s generally easier and more affordable to keep the customers you already have than it is to find new ones. Instead of letting your customers fade into the background during your slow months, find ways to stay connected. Here are some ideas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Make a call: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you offer a seasonal service like yard maintenance or holiday light installation, reach out to your customers during the off-season to check in. You can ask if they need any help, or give them a discount code to use on their next service.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Keep customers in the loop: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your business’s name top of mind by sending out regular emails with promotion opportunities, industry news, or important business announcements. If you shut down your business for a certain period of time every year, make sure your customers know when you’re opening your doors again. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a loyalty program: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show customers you value their business by offering rewards and perks. You can offer discounts for referrals, or create a system where people get additional points with each purchase or service. </span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Make a marketing plan</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not need to allocate as much money to marketing if your business has a true off-season, but it’s still smart to have a game plan for the slower months. Consistent marketing is critical to drawing in new customers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping current ones engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To come up with an effective plan, start by laying out your budget for marketing and advertising during peak season. From there, you can work backward and see what’s realistic for the slower season. Here are just a handful of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/b2b-marketing-strategies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may want to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/grow-businesss-instagram"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-down on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to connect with customers and promote your offerings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put out content (like email newsletters, blog posts, videos, and guides) that help generate brand awareness. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in a few low-cost, high-impact ad placements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend in-person events and online conferences to network and keep your business’s name out there.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1></h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Invest in business improvements </span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slow periods are the perfect time to invest back into your business. Even a few simple improvements can help you increase revenue, attract more customers during the busy season, and increase operational efficiency. Before you start making changes, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/evaluating-business-goals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the next busy season and beyond. Depending on what you want to achieve, you may decide to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Streamline administrative processes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assess your internal processes and systems for efficiency and ease. To fix inconveniences or problems, you may need to organize your digital files, invest in customer relationship management software, or change payroll providers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Train your workforce: </b><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/how-to-motivate-employees"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train your employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on proper customer service and job techniques, so you can hit the ground running come busy season. You can also use this time to search for new job candidates.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your equipment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule maintenance checks for big-ticket items, like point-of-sale systems, computers, machinery, and vehicles. You may want to replace old models or research new technology and equipment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Network: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an effort to connect with business owners in your community and attend virtual or in-person industry conferences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Update your website: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give your site a refresh: fix any bugs, update old content and information, and give your landing page a makeover. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a seasonal operation can be challenging, but with a little planning and preparation, you can thrive all year long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need working capital to get through a slow period or take advantage of a busy one, </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/get-credit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out Fundbox’s line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

You’re not alone, especially after the curveball we faced in 2020. Where should you start? While there are a variety of ways to cut expenses, you’ll need to find the right places to make cuts for your unique business. Here’s a guide to help you learn more about your options and how to get started.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to cut expenses?</h2>
<p>When you want to cut business expenses, it means you want to reduce the amount of money you are spending. For example, if you make $15,000 per month but spend $5,000, you may want to reduce the $5,000 in expenses so you can increase your profit margin. You can do so by completely cutting out something you regularly purchase or by reducing the amount you pay for it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Learn more about how cutting costs and other steps can help you <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grow your business on a budget</a>. </em></strong></p>
<h2>How to know where to cut expenses when needed</h2>
<p>If your business is struggling to stay afloat, or if you would just like to maximize your profit margin, it’s probably a good idea to audit your expenses. Here’s how to start.</p>
<h3>Prioritize expenses</h3>
<p>First, you’ll need to take inventory of all of your expenses. Ask your accountant to send you an expense report for the past 90 days (or pull it up in your reporting system). Organize your expenses by type (travel, inventory, payroll, bills, etc.). Then, identify which expenses are critical, helpful but not required, and nice but not necessary.</p>
<h3>Identify negotiables</h3>
<p>From there, identify which of the expenses are negotiable. For example, if you have a business phone plan that you need for your employees, you could contact the service provider and ask if there are any promotional plan offerings. You likely have more negotiable expenses than you think such as rent, internet services, merchant account provider fees, vendor prices, insurance premiums, and more.</p>
<h3>Make cuts accordingly</h3>
<p>Negotiate down all of the expenses you can. Then, go through and analyze which of the non-critical expenses you can cut out or reduce. Continue to make cuts until you reach your target expense amount.

<h2>Where can I cut costs for my business?</h2>
<p>Below you’ll find some of the top ways to cut expenses for your business along with money-saving tips.</p>
<h3>Hiring</h3>
<p>Finding new employees and onboarding them can be a time-consuming and expensive process. When it comes time to audit costs, many look to hiring as an area to cut back. How can you save? Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Double down on an employee referral program</li>
<li aria-level="1">Conduct group virtual interviews to save time</li>
<li aria-level="1">Implement extensive phone screenings</li>
<li aria-level="1">Implement pre-qualifications assessments</li>
<li aria-level="1">Write compelling job postings</li>
<li aria-level="1">Brainstorm how to improve employee retention to reduce the need to hire</li>
<li aria-level="1">Streamline your hiring process with technology like an applicant tracking system</li>
<li aria-level="1">Post your jobs on free platforms like Indeed, Google for Jobs, Hubstaff Talent, and on social media platforms (particularly LinkedIn)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Temporarily pause hiring</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these can help you chip away at the potentially high costs of hiring.</p>
<h3>Marketing and advertising</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sba.gov/taxonomy/term/15051?page=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> recommends that you spend 7% to 8% of your budget on marketing if you have revenues of $5 million or less. You could split those expenses between raising brand awareness and promoting your business through advertising, events, or other marketing initiatives. While these expenses are often essential to the success of your business, audit your spending to see what’s working and where you can make cuts.</p>
<p>In crunch times, you’ll want to focus on the channels and strategies that are providing the best results while pulling away from those that aren’t. <em><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneur</a></em> suggests ideas such as improving your customer targeting, reducing your active channels, utilizing marketing automation tools, repurposing older content, and considering shifting to a remote team.</p>
<h3>Business travel</h3>
<p>While the pandemic likely helped to reduce this cost for many businesses, life is returning to normal, which means business travel will likely pick up again. Keeping tabs on these costs starts with adopting a cost-saving mindset. Ask if travel is really necessary or if it can be replaced with a virtual interaction. If travel is required, carefully plan a budget for each trip. Look for opportunities to save through business credit cards with travel perks, establishing relationships with preferred vendors, and consider placing strict limits on expenditures.</p>
<h3>Team perks</h3>
<p>When it comes to team perks, be careful not to damage team morale. Many employees would probably rather remain an employee with fewer perks than become an ex-employee that’s been laid off due to the company’s overspending. In tough times, review the perks you provide along with the costs and analyze which cuts would be most profitable to the bottom line while having the least negative impact on employees. You may want to ask the employees which perks are most beneficial to them and which they don’t value quite as much.</p>
<h3>Current staff and payroll</h3>
<p>Payroll is often the largest expense for a business so it’s important to consider it when you are looking to cut costs. While layoffs should be a last resort, you can consider other ways of reducing costs such as temporarily reducing hours, restricting overtime hours, cross-training employees, using payroll software to automate operations, and making adjustments to optimize benefits like retirement plans, health insurance, and flex spending accounts. You may even want to explore <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/small-business-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outsourcing tasks</a> versus hiring full-time employees (where applicable) and offering salary reductions in exchange for a commission-based payment structure.</p>
<h3>Tools and Services</h3>
<p>Many companies have a laundry list of tools that add to their yearly or monthly expenses. When cutting costs, you’ll want to review all the tools and services you currently use to analyze if they are providing the highest ROI possible. In some cases, you may be able to cancel the subscription to a tool that’s not providing value or replace it with one that’s more effective. For example, payroll automation software may help  businesses <a href="https://www.americanpayroll.org/">reduce payroll costs by up to 80%</a>, according to the American Payroll Association. Ensure you have the tools you need, and cancel the tools that are no longer serving you.</p>
<h2>What are the biggest costs for a business?</h2>
<p>In most cases, the biggest business costs come from payroll or human labor, which can account for as much as 70% <a href="https://www.paycor.com/resource-center/articles/the-biggest-cost-of-doing-business-a-closer-look-at-labor-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of business budgets</a>. Included in this category of costs are employee wages, payroll, benefits, and related taxes. Other leading costs for businesses come from overpaying for insurance, overpaying on taxes, and excessive advertising.</p>
<h3>How do you cut expenses drastically?</h3>
<p>To cut expenses drastically,  consider taking a more aggressive approach. This can include only spending money on the line items that are absolutely critical to the continuing operation of your business. Often this requires reducing the largest expenses, which could include payroll. You may need to reduce hours, benefit plans, salaries (including your own), and even, unfortunately, the size of your staff.</p>
<h3>Optimize your budget and grow your business</h3>
<p>The main concept to remember when trying to cut costs is the importance of auditing all of your expenses to ensure you are making the most of every penny you spend. If it’s not essential or not providing ROI, consider cutting it .

What’s more, one in four people are seeking help from a financial advisor for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many individuals want help assessing their investment portfolios and retirement funds, while many small businesses are seeking guidance on how to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/use-job-costing-to-manage-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut expenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, improve cash flow, or apply for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, many financial services businesses—including </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-ways-accounting-firm-can-bring-value-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting firms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CFPs, and CFO consultants—are seeing an influx of new clients this year. However, not every business will keep those clients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve your services </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i> <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/professional-services-challenges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce client turnover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you may need to change your approach. Consider the following three strategies:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Streamline your workflow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamlining your workflow can give you more time to dedicate to your clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take inventory of your processes and see if you can delegate or automate anything,” said Christina Sjahli, a CPA and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.christinasjahli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Sjahli Consulting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sjahli recommended using a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/why-every-business-needs-cash-flow-forecasting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow forecasting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software, which can help save time and eliminate manual calculation errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also delegates tedious tasks. “I look for repetition. If I delegate repeatable tasks to the bookkeepers, I can focus on analyzing and communicating the story behind the business’s financial numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a team to delegate to, consider outsourcing. “Hire the marketing company instead of learning to create a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Tremaine Wills, an investment advisor and the owner of </span><a href="https://www.mindovermoney.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mind Over Money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Whenever possible, save yourself time by doing what you do best, and pay everyone else to do the rest.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Improve your communication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to increase client satisfaction is to become a proficient, empathetic communicator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Communication will make or break your business,” Wills said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, 54% of financial professionals surveyed in the </span><a href="https://www.im.natixis.com/au/research/2020-financial-professionals-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Natixis Global Survey of Financial Professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said frequent client communication is a top factor for success. When asked why their past clients left, 60% of survey respondents said it was because they failed to listen to their clients’ needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every client will have different needs and preferences, so it’s a good idea to ask how often they want to hear from you, Wills said, whether it’s on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sjahli likes doing a weekly update with her business clients. She goes over critical points of discussion throughout the week; checks in on milestone progress; discusses next steps and goals; and asks her clients what type of support they need for the coming week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every call, email, or Zoom meeting with your clients, aim to listen intently, ask follow-up questions, and speak in a helpful, compassionate tone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try taking on the role of a teacher, Wills said; that means over-explaining tricky topics and operating on the assumption that your clients don’t know everything. Especially right now, “Our clients need reassurance that their plans make sense and that we’ll guide them through these trying times,” she said. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Offer services and solutions that address your clients’ fears </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving your services starts with figuring out what your clients need. Before you dive into their taxes or create a plan for their investments, take the time to sit down and discuss your clients’ goals and fears.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sjahli said many of her business clients are trying to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">close their cash flow gaps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shift money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their most profitable services or products right now. Others, however, are worried about raising capital or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/business-growth-on-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning for growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a recession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her clients, Wills said, “Many millennials are struggling with building wealth due to being crippled by student loan debt. And my clients who are parents fear their children may face the same financial obstacles they faced in their early adult years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand your clients’ greatest concerns, you can work on creating a plan or solution that helps address and mitigate their fears. Depending on your business services and clientele, that might mean presenting your client with different investment options every month, introducing them to business bookkeeping software, or generating personalized </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/7-free-small-business-budget-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly budget plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another tool to help prepare your clients for difficulty is to do scenario analyses, Sjahli said. That way, “Clients can be proactive instead of reactive when an unexpected event happens.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go above and beyond</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going the extra mile for your clients can result in lower client turnover and stronger </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/search/referral"><span style="font-weight: 400;">referrals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Consider what you can offer your clients beyond personalized services. Maybe you can provide on-demand help and guidance, for example, weekly one-on-one check-ins, or free access to budgeting or forecasting software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need financial help to hire extra hands or invest in new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, consider applying for a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="482" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_33331051-768x482.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Business people on starting line" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_33331051-768x482.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_33331051.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting ahead of the competition is critical to building a thriving business—and the key to staying competitive is innovating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers reward innovators,” said Dave Munson, the owner and CEO of </span><a href="https://saddlebackleather.com/?SID=a8d78bef759d908f0091c064ced905da" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saddleback Leather Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a store that sells high-quality leather goods and accessories. “They like companies that try to improve things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improvement, however, often requires financing. According to the </span><a href="https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/fedsmallbusiness/files/2019/sbcs-employer-firms-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Small Business Credit Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 56% of small businesses have sought financing to expand or pursue an opportunity. Extra cash can give you the freedom to generate ideas, experiment with marketing tactics, and take risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding and credit are essential to tapping growth opportunities,” said Ted Chan, the CEO of </span><a href="https://www.caredash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CareDash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online healthcare review directory. “Markets innovate very quickly now—whether it&#8217;s debt or equity, funding can launch a new product or service line to capture fast-moving opportunities.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are particularly flexible. Unlike a term loan, which gives you a lump sum of cash, a line of credit is revolving. You can tap into your funds on an ongoing basis and use them repeatedly as long as you bring your balance back down to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to step up your game? Here are five ways you can use funding to edge out your competition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Develop a new product or service</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a unique product or service can help you attract new customers and increase revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the best ways to stay competitive in any field is to stay on top of the trends and always put your customer&#8217;s needs and wants first,” said Lydia McConnell, the founder and creative director of </span><a href="https://www.lechicmiami.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Chic Miami</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a shop that sells handmade jewelry. “What would your customers benefit from the most? How can you make the best possible experience for them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For McConnell, that means gathering feedback from customers on their favorite jewelry styles, then experimenting with designs, colors, and concepts. For other businesses, catering to customers’ needs might require conducting market research, adding new features to current products, or investing in a unique platform or offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We used our line of credit to build out our core product, the CareDash healthcare directory,” said Chan. “Staying ahead of the curve on key trends like the consumerization of healthcare, telemedicine, and value-based care is essential to the growth of our business.” </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Improve production and increase output</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can’t compete with larger companies on price, try competing on output. Using </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/use-first-business-loan-effectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to streamline your production process can help you take on more work and grow your business quicker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When McConnell used a line of credit to purchase a laser cutting machine for her studio, she was able to process larger orders. “Before, when I was using a laser cutter at a local Makerspace I could only use their machine two hours a day.” Full-time access to such an efficient tool also helped McConnell improve the quality of her products. “It has really allowed me to create complex shapes and more intricate designs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider which areas of your business’s production process are slow or outdated. If, for example, you struggle with organizing inventory or boxing items quickly, you could use a line of credit to purchase inventory management software or buy packaging equipment. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Meet increased demand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not your business operates seasonally, there are certain times of the year when you need to respond to a surge in demand. “We always want to have our most popular things in stock during the big season,” Munson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/what-is-a-business-line-of-credit-and-how-does-this-popular-financing-option-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you cover upfront costs in raw materials, labor, production, and storage. Or, if you run a service-based business you could use a temporary cash infusion to hire seasonal employees or contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use our line of credit in August or September and start producing an extra 10-15% of product each month to prepare for the holidays,” Munson said. “We have to buy a lot of leather and pay for the labor without the sales, but once the sales come in they far outweigh the interest on the line of credit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to have enough resources to cater to customers when demand spikes; businesses that do are more likely to see repeat customers and benefit from referrals. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Invest in marketing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tempting to cut your business’s </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/design-your-2019-retail-marketing-growth-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when cash is tight, but consistent marketing can be critical to expanding your customer base. A line of credit can give you the financial cushion to adopt a new marketing strategy or try a different distribution method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your content marketing consists mostly of articles and blog posts, for example, you may want to explore videos and infographics. Or maybe you want to double-down on strategies with a proven ROI, like email campaigns and social media ads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding can also give you the freedom to rethink your approach to finding and retaining customers. Chan said his company employs judo strategy, which involves responding quickly to market changes and adding new features to their products before their competitors can. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then market these features aggressively as differentiating points.”  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Capitalize on growth opportunities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking advantage of growth opportunities can set you up for long-term success, but you need the funds to act fast. A line of credit can provide the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-positive-vs-profitability-whats-difference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> necessary to acquire a smaller competitor, relocate to a busier side of town, or bid on a large project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Munson, the opportunity came when his clients began asking him to manufacture for them. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had to hire people for a few months and pay for their salaries and their training, on top of trying to grow the company and continue with inventory,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the upfront expenses, the work came with long-term benefits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more I can grow the factory, the more it distributes the fixed costs of the factory and makes us more competitive in our pricing,” Munson said.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ahead of the game</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying ahead of the competition is essential to your business’s longevity and financial stability. To see if you can get the funding you need to help gain this competitive edge, apply for a </span><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundbox line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now. </span></p>

Janitorial businesses make a significant contribution to the U.S economy. <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry/default.aspx?indid=1496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> by IBIS World shows that the U.S. janitorial market amounts to more than 904,000+ businesses; 1,846,488 employees; and annual revenues of $53 billion, and that&#8217;s expected to dramatically increase in 2020.</p>
<p>While growth in this sector was only moderate at 1.6% annually, the <a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/covid-19-janitorial-demand-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demand for cleaning businesses</a> has exploded since the outbreak of COVID-19. Here are ten tips for getting a share of that pie and grow your janitorial business.</p>
<h2><strong>10 Ways to Grow Your Janitorial Business</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Start by Looking at Your Current Customer Base</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to grow your janitorial business, your current customer base can tell you a great deal about why your business is a success, where it needs to grow, and what goals and tactics you should spend your time on. This little bit of research is an essential first step to growth that will help you repeat your wins rather than adopt a scatter-gun approach to growth.</p>
<p>Think about where your current customers come from. What were the lead sources? Was it from referrals, word of mouth, advertisements? Which tactic worked best? Is it a model you can repeat?</p>
<h3><strong>2. Know What Your Customer is Looking For</strong></h3>
<p>Take your customer research to the next level by building a picture of their needs. Never assume that your growth plans align with what your customers want or you risk going after a market opportunity that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Get feedback from current and even prospective customers to see what they look for when selecting and retaining a janitorial service. It&#8217;s never always just about price. It could be reliability, quality of work, flexible schedules, employee conduct, and so on. The industry is increasingly moving towards green cleaning services (which IBIS states as a key opportunity for janitorial businesses)—is there a need in your market?</p>
<p>Then consider how your competition stacks up against these needs. How do they compare to your business? Is there a gap you can fill?</p>
<h3><strong>3. Stop and Think About Your Business Vision</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been in business for a while, there&#8217;s a good chance that the day to day &#8220;busyness&#8221; of running a business has taken your eye off your wider goals. As you think about growing your business, reflect on what you want that business to look like.</p>
<p>Do you want to take on larger clients? Or, perhaps, expand into other sites, campuses, or locations that your existing clients have? (This is low hanging fruit and could be a win-win if you can add some sort of incentive, such as a discount). Determine the types of businesses you want to go into.</p>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps you might see more success in diversifying your offerings? For example, could you add window cleaning or HVAC maintenance to your services? Your vision will help steer your growth strategies.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Plan Your Marketing in Chunks</strong></h3>
<p>When did you last see any marketing or branding excitement from a janitorial business? Not that often, right? Once you have a vision and a strategy, think about your marketing plan. This will give you a path to follow that can help you grow your janitorial business.</p>
<p>Your plan should be informed by your goals and your research, and it is best approached in chunks. If you are trying to reach customers who don&#8217;t know about your business, you&#8217;ll need some awareness tactics in there (advertising, PR, etc.). You&#8217;ll also need a plan for once they are engaged (i.e. they want to learn more about you)—this could include case studies, customer references, a short YouTube video explaining your core values and service offerings, etc. Finally, find a way to keep marketing through your happy customers using a referral program. For more tips, check out these tips from my fellow blogger, Rieva Lesonsky: Creating a Marketing Action Plan.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Create a Target Customer List</strong></h3>
<p>As you think about your marketing tactics, refer again to your vision. What defines growth for you? Are you hoping to expand your service delivery radius? What kinds of buildings are you looking to target (medical offices, day care facilities, auto dealerships, malls, corporate offices, etc.). This will help you determine who to target in your marketing.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Good Old Direct Mail Still Works</strong></h3>
<p>If you intend to run a direct mail campaign (always a good idea if you&#8217;re trying to reach a specific person), create a short list of target companies within your service area. Find out who the facility manager is and build a spreadsheet of all your target contacts. Plan around your budget, but be prepared to send 3–5 mail pieces and stagger your messages. Start by introducing yourself and your company, then send a brochure, follow it with a piece that links to success stories on your website, include a small giveaway like a fridge magnet with your contact info, then ask for a meeting, perhaps offer a free trial—think of it as a drip effect.</p>
<p>Keep at it. If you didn&#8217;t have much success, &#8220;rinse and repeat&#8221;. Come up with new marketing pieces, consider tweaking your message, and start the cycle again six months later.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Knock on Doors</strong></h3>
<p>Door-to-door sales can be an effective sales strategy for janitorial services, an industry which, as I mentioned earlier, often flies under the radar of traditional, big-splash marketing campaigns. Refer to your target contact list, perfect your pitch, and create a special offer to lock them in.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Get Out in the Community</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to grow your business, be more active in the community in order to build brand recognition. Find ways to participate at town fairs, festivals, and chamber of commerce and networking events. You might even consider sponsoring a fun run or charity event.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Have a Consistent, Defining Message</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, perhaps one of the most important things in marketing is having a consistent marketing message. You can&#8217;t be all things to all people, so carefully consider your differentiators and your target market as well was what you&#8217;ve already successfully done for other companies as you craft your message. Back it up with a story—explain what led you into this line of business, expand on why you&#8217;re different, and how this permeates your mission and what you do. The story is a useful starting point to crafting your sales and elevator pitch, website messaging, advertising, and other marketing tactics (brochures, flyers, social media) that you use to build awareness.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Get Quick Funds with a Line of Credit</strong></h3>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://app.fundbox.com/signup">business line of credit</a> </strong>can help you with payroll, supplies, and overhead expenses while you&#8217;re waiting to get paid. It can also arm you with the short-term capital you need to grow. You can use these funds to launch a marketing plan, hire new employees, expand or open a new location, or many of the other growth tactics mentioned above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img width="768" height="512" src="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1660490494-768x512.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Professional consultant smiling behind laptop" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1660490494-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fundbox.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock_1660490494.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has challenges, but many B2B companies struggle with similar issues due to the nature of their work. Professional services firms in particular routinely come up against </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/avoid-5-major-cash-flow-mistakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow constraints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hiring difficulties, and schedule setbacks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with business lagging due to COVID-19, many of the obstacles these companies face loom even larger right now. Fortunately, there are helpful solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a professional services company, here are the five most common challenges you might be facing—and what you can do to overcome them. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Maximizing billable hours </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a professional services firm, maximizing the number of billable hours per employee is critical to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/helpful-strategies-manage-next-cash-flow-crunch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and increasing profits. “Time is the inventory of service-run businesses, and it’s a perishable resource that goes bad by the second,” said Nick Bideshi, the CEO of </span><a href="https://wearebluemeta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Meta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital marketing agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our biggest challenge is missing out on billable hours because of the fast-paced working environment we have,” said Michael Hammelburger, the CEO of </span><a href="https://thebottomlinegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bottom Line Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that helps business owners reduce their business expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The time spent on calls and online messaging with clients outside of work,” he said, “or the time spent traveling for consultations are just some of the hours that get neglected when consultants forget to log them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neglecting to log billable hours can cost your company thousands of dollars in revenue, but it’s only part of the issue. The larger concern is making sure employees have enough billable work each week. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximizing your employees’ billable hours comes down to better organization and project management. Start by reviewing your record-keeping methods. “We have a dedicated team that administers a software tool that captures billable hours according to our billing guidelines,” Hammelburger said. “We’ve improved compliance and accuracy by 90% and avoided writing off billable hours just to fast-track payments from clients.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, consider your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project management techniques</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. How do you typically assign projects? Are some employees overworked while others sit idle? You may need to change your teams or distribution style to ensure everyone has enough billable work throughout the week. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Hiring and training </span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-hiring-challenges-and-solutions-for-small-business-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a professional services firm can be a catch-22. You likely need to hire to help offset your project load, but hiring also creates more work for you and your team in the short-term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to constantly balance hiring employees and onboarding clients,” said Bideshi. Not only do you have to find, vet, and interview candidates, you also have to train them, which requires a significant amount of non-billable time and resources. Plus, depending on your new hire’s experience level, it can take weeks or months for that person to become billable and start generating revenue for the company.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent lost revenue and job opportunities, it can be helpful to try to shorten your company’s time frame for hiring and training, while simultaneously increasing the checks and balances in the processes. Consider clarifying the scope of work in your job description, casting a wider net for candidates, or conducting more thorough interviews. These steps can help you find more experienced candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to training, the right </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/moving-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help speed up the process. “We’ve automated 90% of our onboard training for non-management employees by using software solutions to hold courses meant for internal purposes,” Bideshi said. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Acquiring new clients </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining your existing clientele while searching for new clients is a perpetual challenge. Even if you have ongoing client relationships, it’s still important to incorporate new clients to stay current, boost your revenue, and keep your team agile, said Sarah M. Williams, the founder and director of </span><a href="https://816nyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">816 New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a brand strategy and communications agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plus, you don’t want to be too reliant—especially now during COVID-19—on only a few relationships, since things are so much in flux.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting new clients doesn’t just happen with time and patience—it also requires resources. You may have to budget for </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new marketing initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spend money on advertising campaigns, and carve out time for consultations and proposals. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on revamping your marketing plan. “We have content marketing campaigns that run from our website that are meant to acquire leads, specifically those with communications strategy needs,” Williams said. Content marketing efforts, as well as online ads and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/earn-more-sales-with-email-marketing-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email nurture campaigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help bring more potential clients to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising any free services you offer is also a good idea. “We do a free 30-minute consultation,” Williams said, “which often turns into a proposal process if the lead seems strong enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also want to source potential clients from your network. Look into virtual conferences or discussion panels, or consider implementing a referral program to incentivize past and current clients to spread your name around. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Planning for ongoing demand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a professional services firm means balancing your time between working on current projects and planning for future work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A client’s budget can end, scale up, or start abruptly for various reasons,” said Bideshi. “In a post-COVID-19 world, these ups and downs seem more violent than they did prior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t plan for periods of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/10-ways-to-maximize-winter-downtime-in-your-construction-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downtime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or increased demand, certain areas of your business can suffer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a marketing agency, for example, “Demand for the design team could exceed its capacity, meanwhile the strategy or writing team doesn’t have enough work,” Bideshi said. This can throw off your project timelines and billable hours, both of which ultimately affect your profits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Demand issues arise from not having consistency in the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/creating-a-great-omnichannel-b2b-customer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sales funnel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Bideshi. “This can be due to overspecialization in the types of firms a company works with, or improper business development processes.”  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to draw consistent leads and generate steady demand is to improve your sales funnel, Bideshi said. “A key factor to consider is the monthly or yearly client churn based on revenue, not number of accounts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, try using data to determine the strongest and weakest points in your sales funnel. If, for example, you know most of your clients leave your website after visiting the </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/4-critical-ways-landing-pages-help-grow-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landing page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, work on brainstorming ways to increase engagement at that stage. That might involve adding a video to the page, tightening the copy, or directing potential clients to a free consultation or discount on their first service. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Waiting for client payments</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge I&#8217;ve always faced as a self-employed SEO and website designer is the amount of time it takes some companies to pay for the service they&#8217;ve requested,” said Jase Rodley, the founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://dialedlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dialed Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a website design and SEO agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many professional services firms end up waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for their client payments. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the issue. According to a recent report, </span><a href="https://group.atradius.com/publications/payment-practices-barometer/usmca-2020-late-payments-rise-as-recession-bites.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">late payments affect 43% of the total value of B2B invoices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued in North America this year. What’s more, the total value of payments overdue by more than 90 days has doubled to 13%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash flow thins out quickly when you’re waiting for receivables, making it tricky to cover operating expenses, let alone budget for growth initiatives like hiring or investing in new technology. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a handful of strategies you can use to keep </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/cash-flow-statement-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cash flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> steady. One option, Rodley said, is to charge a non-refundable deposit on your services. “It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives you some wiggle room for your bills without needing to be paid fully.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to set up a payment plan. “We auto-bill our ongoing clients and put our project work on an installment plan that’s also auto-billed, so we always get paid,” Williams said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also negotiate with your suppliers or vendors to extend the deadlines for your payables, Hammelburger suggested. Just make sure you have a good relationship with those vendors; otherwise, you might risk burning a bridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re having a difficult time trying to speed up your receivables or delay your payables, consider turning to an online lender. At Fundbox, we offer </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/resources/guides/lines-credit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business lines of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming your firm’s challenges comes down to implementing more efficient systems—for everything from sales to hiring. If you’re struggling with an area of your business, take some to regroup and </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/coronavirus-business-pivoting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategize for your success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And if you need help with cash flow, consider applying for a </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/#how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business line of credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

To reopen safely, welcome customers back, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rebuild the local economy, business owners should work together. Here are some examples and suggestions for collaborating during the new normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A sudden downturn in business takes a toll on a business owner,” said Traci Bisson, the owner and founder of </span><a href="https://ittakesavillagenh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Takes a Village Pet Care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Hampshire. “After taking time to adjust to your new circumstances, you realize the way you used to do business may no longer work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why it helps to “reach out, commiserate, and talk about what comes next” with other professionals in your industry, Bisson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://assets.alignable.com/member-resources/coronavirus-report-smb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May 2020 survey from Alignable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, small business owners said the best recovery resource—beyond </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/ppp-loan-forgiveness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—would be a discussion with business owners in their industries and communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s invaluable to have input from other business owners on how they’re opening after COVID-19, said Gabriella Braddock, co-owner of </span><a href="http://www.thevaultstudio973.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vault Music Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in New Jersey. “The ideas and gems that can be dropped during this conversation could be the difference between you being hesitant to open versus feeling empowered, educated, and confident.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’ve recently reopened or are in the process of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/plan-for-reopening-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating a plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, connecting with local and faraway business owners can help. Here are five easy ways to collaborate with and support other businesses. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Join industry organizations and groups </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can chat with business owners in your industry through online discussion forums, groups, and professional organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bisson founded the NH Pet Industry Professionals Group, where members “share ideas, tips, strategies, dreams, and goals for advancing the pet industry in New Hampshire as well as in their own businesses.” Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the group has held online meetings to network, discuss new protocol, and brainstorm ways to address customer concerns, Bisson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using Facebook Live and StreamYard has also been a great way for us to stay connected and offer expert advice to other group members,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not yet part of an industry organization, union, or group, consider joining one or creating your own. Having a space to discuss the future of your industry with other professionals—whether they’re experienced or new to the field—can give you the knowledge and motivation you need to pivot your business model or </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/update-your-digital-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upgrade your marketing plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon reopening.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Connect with local business owners </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to talking with people in your industry, it may be helpful to reach out to business owners in your community. Braddock recommended starting a Facebook page for all the businesses in your area. “Allow each business person to add their social media channels, their websites, specials, and promotions,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also use the page to host virtual events, coordinate Zoom meetings, post COVID-19 updates, and share suggestions for improving safety practices and increasing foot traffic, Braddock said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How quickly your business recovers after </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/improving-business-while-closed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reopening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depends on a number of factors, one of which is your community’s ability to come together and support small businesses. Reassuring the community starts with local businesses supporting one another and being transparent about their reopening procedures, Braddock said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Check in on each other, promote [each other] on social media, keep all communication channels clear, and hold weekly meetings to work together to ensure each business is fully covered,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to extend your reach, get in touch with your city’s business council organization, join a local </span><a href="https://www.score.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCORE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chapter, or look for the Small Business Administration’s closest </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/content/find-local-sba-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small Business Development Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These organizations offer resources like free business mentoring, workshops, newsletters, and networking events. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Partner with businesses for promotions and events</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/spring-cleaning-business-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with other businesses can help you boost your revenue and expand your customer base upon reopening. “You get double the brain power and double the network reach,” said Bisson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to other business owners in your area or industry to discuss the potential for collaboration. You could partner with another company to promote each other’s services or content in blog posts or email newsletters, Bisson said. “This also offers critical backlinks,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-promotions are also helpful. If you own a flower shop, for example, you could partner with the boutique gift shop across the street to give customers a 15% discount code. The key with referrals and discounts, Braddock said, is to “give your customer base an incentive to follow through on that other business’s offer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships can also take the form of </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-event-marketing-strategies-grow-business-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like teaming up with other local businesses to organize a monthly farmers market or artisan day. If you’ve never worked with another business before, now is a great time to consider a collaboration. Thoughtful partnerships can have short-term boosts </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long-term benefits for both businesses involved. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Get involved in your community </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cities and neighborhoods begin to reopen, it’s important to show your support. Getting involved in your community can help you bring in new business and rekindle relationships with previous customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that, Bisson founded the NH Dog Walking Club, a community outreach program dedicated to improving the lives of pets and pet owners in her area. “Quarterly, we partner with a New Hampshire-based pet charity to create awareness and raise funds for their mission,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also host live Q&amp;A sessions where pet owners can ask questions and engage with dog trainers, veterinarians, canine enrichment experts, animal communicators, pet first aid/CPR instructors, sustainable pet care experts, and more,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of ways to participate in your community’s reopening and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on what your community needs, you could consider donating a percentage of your profits to a local charity, hosting a community clean-up event, or offering to sponsor a community member doing valuable work in the area. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Embrace outsourcing and referrals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting other businesses shouldn’t be a short-term goal, but a lifelong commitment, Braddock said. “Whenever you are given the opportunity, outsource and refer to local small businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run an architecture firm, for example, you could use local restaurants for your team meals or outsource your marketing to local freelance designers and writers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a good idea to </span><a href="https://fundbox.com/blog/5-ways-improve-referral-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other businesses on your social media platforms, Braddock said. “Use your stories and, if comfortable, your posts to highlight [someone else’s] business and promote how it might apply to your client pool and follower base.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the time to advance other businesses sets a good example for business owners everywhere, and helps foster a culture of support and community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborating with other businesses isn’t just a nice gesture—it’s a good way to rebuild your operations after COVID-19 shutdowns. In addition to promoting other businesses, focus on forming meaningful partnerships and participating in community discussions.
