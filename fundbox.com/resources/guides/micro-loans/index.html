Consider a microloan for your small business</h2><p>There are many reasons to consider microloans as a funding solution for your business. Whether you’re facing an urgent cash flow gap or want to invest in marketing and expand your operation, a microloan can help. While traditional bank loans have higher borrowing limits and lower interest rates for business owners, they’re also harder to obtain, especially if your business is just starting out. If you don’t have a credit record or otherwise don’t qualify for a loan from a bank, a microloan could help you get the funds you need. </p><p>In this guide, we’ll discuss everything you need to know about microloans, including: </p><ul><li><p>What microlending is</p></li><li><p>How microloans work</p></li><li><p>Why your business may need a microloan</p></li><li><p>How to use a microloan</p></li><li><p>How to qualify for a microloan</p></li><li><p>The pros and cons of microloans</p></li><li><p>Where to find a certified microloan lender</p></li><li><p>How to apply for an SBA microloan</p></li><li><p>Alternative funding sources for your small business</p></li></ul><h2 id="h-what-is-microlending" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">What is microlending?</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="../../../blog/what-is-microlending/index.html">Microlending</a> is the practice of giving small loans to businesses in need. A subset of micro finance, microlending is designed to support business owners who either don’t have access to business funding or can’t get loans from traditional financial institutions because of their credit scores. </p><p>Microlending for small businesses has become popular thanks to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, dedicated micro finance institutions (MFIs), and local micro lenders.</p><h2 id="h-what-is-a-microloan" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">What is a microloan?</h2><p>Micro business loans, as the name suggests, are small term loans. Depending on where you live, a microloan can be as small as a few hundred dollars or as large as $50,000 (as in the US). Businesses can use microloans in their early stages to pay for inventory, machines, office and business supplies, equipment, and working capital. In the US, most microloans are low-interest, short-term loans provided by business-friendly lending organizations, such as small banks and credit unions that work with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sba.gov/">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> (SBA).</p><p>In 2009 under President Barack Obama’s administration, the SBA started a microloan program to <a target="_blank" href="../small-business-loans/index.html">help struggling small businesses get loans</a> up to $50,000 (with an average loan amount of $13,000). Designated lenders, like banks and other financial institutions, work with the SBA to offer microloans to businesses that need them. To date, the program has provided tens of thousands of loans to small business owners for the purposes of <a target="_blank" href="../../../blog/starting-a-new-business-here-are-5-tips-thatll-make-it-easier-3/index.html">starting a new business</a> or expanding an existing one.</p><p>However, though microloans are designed with small businesses in mind, they have certain restrictions and limitations. We’ll discuss the drawbacks of microloans—as well as the benefits—in the Pros and Cons section.</p><h2 id="h-why-might-your-business-need-a-microloan" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">Why might your business need a microloan?</h2><p>Getting approved for a traditional bank loan can be tough. Even if your business is booming, you may still be denied a loan. Here are a few reasons why:</p><ol><li><p><b>Not enough collateral: </b>In order to take a risk on your business, many banks require collateral in the form of assets or property. If you fail to pay back your loan, the bank will use your collateral to recoup their payment. However, if you’re just starting out and haven’t built up enough assets or revenue, you may not have the collateral necessary to get approved for a loan. </p></li><li><p><b>Not enough cash flow: </b>If your business doesn’t have enough revenue or cash flow to make your loan payments every month, banks will likely deny your loan application.</p></li><li><p><b>Credit history or credit score: </b>To qualify for a bank loan, you must have a good personal and <a target="_blank" href="../business-credit-score/index.html">business credit history and score</a>. Your credit history doesn’t just determine whether or not the bank will give you a loan—it also determines the interest rate you qualify for. If you just started your business, have missed vendor or loan payments in the past, or don’t have considerable cash flow, you may not have a strong enough personal or business credit profile to meet a bank’s requirements. </p></li><li><p><b>Small loan amounts: </b>Most small businesses aren’t looking for massive loans—they’re looking for small amounts of capital to tide them over for a short period of time. However, traditional banks are designed to serve bigger businesses that need significant capital injections, like a hundred thousand dollars to a million dollars. For that reason, many banks will deny your application for a smaller loan in favor of prioritizing customers who need larger amounts of money. Because the cost of underwriting is the same whether the loan is $5,000 or $500,000, small loans simply aren’t as profitable for banks as larger loans. </p></li><li><p><b>The risk is greater for banks: </b>Banks are extremely risk averse, especially since the recession in 2008. Banks are especially cautious when dealing with small businesses that may not grow or be able to make payments on time. To avoid losing money, traditional banks are more inclined to deny your small business a loan in economically unstable climates. </p></li></ol><p>When a traditional bank refuses your loan application for a small business loan, a microloan can be a great option. Unlike business loans from traditional financial institutions, there are few limitations for who can apply for microloans. Microloans are available to most small business owners, even those with low credit ratings or cash flow problems.</p><h2 id="h-how-can-you-use-a-microloan-for-your-business" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">How can you use a microloan for your business?</h2><p>There are a wide range of possibilities for how to use a microloan. You can use a microloan to fulfill basic operational requirements when setting up your new business or when growing your existing operation. Microloans offered by the SBA lending program are often used for the following:</p><ul><li><p>Working capital</p></li><li><p>Inventory </p></li><li><p>Supplies</p></li><li><p>Furniture or fixtures</p></li><li><p>Machinery or equipment</p></li><li><p>Start-up costs</p></li></ul><h2 id="h-how-can-you-qualify-for-a-microloan" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">How can you qualify for a microloan?</h2><p>MFIs and small business lenders offer microloans to qualified small businesses. Businesses looking for a microloan might be relatively young, have <a target="_blank" href="../../../blog/common-issues-affecting-cash-flow-statement/index.html">cash flow issues</a>, or be located in a low-income area. Depending on your business’s finances and credit score, it may be easier to get a <a target="_blank" href="../../../blog/invoice-funding-online-lenders/index.html">microloan from a lender than a term loan from a major bank</a>. Traditional term loans can be hard to qualify for without a stellar credit score, whereas the requirements for a microloan are more flexible. Keep in mind, however, that qualifications for microloans may vary depending on the lender’s requirements.</p><p>Here are the factors lenders consider when evaluating a microloan application:</p><ul><li><p>How long your business has been in operation</p></li><li><p>The amount of money you need</p></li><li><p>Your business’s location</p></li><li><p>Your financial track record</p></li><li><p>Your long-term goals</p></li></ul><p>The likelihood that you’ll be able to repay the loan within the given time frame</p><p>If you’re just starting your business, microloan lenders will generally require you to provide a <a target="_blank" href="../../../blog/writing-business-plans/index.html">comprehensive business plan</a>. This plan should indicate:</p><ul><li><p>How you plan to generate revenue</p></li><li><p>How well you understand your market</p></li><li><p>What you’ll use the microloan for </p></li><li><p>How the microloan will help grow your business</p></li></ul><p>Getting approved for a microloan has much more to do with your vision and story than with your creditworthiness. Microloan lenders analyze your business goals, background, and plans in order to assess your reliability as a business owner and determine how much potential your business has.</p><h2 id="h-pros-of-getting-a-microloan" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">Pros of getting a microloan</h2><ol><li><p><b>They cater to small businesses: </b>A microloan is a good option for a small business, especially if you don’t need a large amount of money and have never borrowed from a bank before.</p></li><li><p><b>They’re easier to obtain: </b>There are fewer requirements to qualify for a microloan than for a traditional term loan.

Microloan lenders who go through the SBA tend to focus on newer businesses or business owners who fall into certain minority groups. Microloan lenders don’t base their decision solely off of creditworthiness, but they do look for borrowers to have a certain minimum credit score. While not publicly posted on the SBA’s site, it appears the SBA microloan program requires a minimum credit score of 575. Above all, lenders want to know 1) that you can repay the loan and 2) that your business has the potential to grow. </p><p>To apply, you should have the following: </p><ul><li><p>A decent credit score</p></li><li><p>Collateral</p></li><li><p>Proof that your business is generating considerable revenue OR financial projections that look promising</p></li><li><p>Proof of steady cash flow </p></li><li><p>No criminal background</p></li><li><p>A comprehensive business plan that explains your business’s value proposition, growth potential, and target market </p></li><li><p>An explanation of how much money you need, what you plan to use it for, and how it will help grow your operation</p></li></ul><h2 id="h-other-sba-loans-for-small-businesses" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">Other SBA loans for small businesses</h2><p>The SBA has a <a target="_blank" href="../sba-loans/index.html">handful of loan programs</a> that cater to small business owners.
