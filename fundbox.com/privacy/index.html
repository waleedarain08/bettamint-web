("Fundbox", "we", "our" or "us"), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about you in connection with the use of: (i) the website fundbox.com, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its subdomains, content and services, a "Site"); and (ii) the Fundbox cash-flow optimization™, capital funding, invoice clearing™ and drawing services (each, a "Service"). The Site and any Service are individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Services".</p><h2 id="h-1-introduction" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">1. Introduction.</h2><p>We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. "Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.</p><p>All business loans and lines of credit issued by First Electronic Bank (“FEB”), a Utah chartered Industrial Bank are subject to FEB’s Privacy Policy, which FEB maintains and can be found <a href="https://www.firstelectronic.com/privacy-policy/">here</a>. Users that receive an FEB-issued loan or line of credit using the Services are also subject to the Privacy Policy and disclosures of FEB. Fundbox is not responsible for the privacy practices of FEB and does not exercise control over FEB’s sites.</p><p>Fundbox may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, elect to contract with one or more other bank(s) to underwrite loans. In such case, you will be notified of such bank(s) during the loan process.</p><h2 id="h-2-terms-of-use" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">2. Terms of Use.</h2><p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use which is available at <a href="../tou/index.html">https://fundbox.com/tou/</a> ("Terms"). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.</p><h2 id="h-3-consent-and-modification" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">3. Consent and Modification.</h2><p>By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.</p><h2 id="h-4-what-personal-information-we-collect-and-how-we-collect-it" class="font-bold text-2xl mt-6 md:mt-10 mb-5">4. What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.</h2><p>We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:</p><h3 id="h-41-account" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.1. Account. </h3><p>In order to participate in the Service, you are required to create an account ("Account"). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:</p><p>(a) Online Registration Form: You may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with a business email address, a password and certain other basic business details that you will use for your Account.</p><p>(b) Third Party Accounts: You may choose to create (or supplement) an Account by clicking on a 'connect' or 'sign on' button that we may display on the Site for a designated account that you have with a third party website or service (each a "Third Party Account"), such as Intuit's QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Xero, or another third party e-invoicing or accounting software product that is designated on our Site. Doing so will enable you to link your Fundbox Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then we will obtain certain information, including Personal Information, from your Third Party Account. The information that we obtain from your Third Party Account is information that you have chosen to make available to us as part of your use of your Third Party Account, and is typically identified in the privacy policy of your Third Party Account provider. You acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of the provider of your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.</p><p>Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address, or to the email address that you have designated in your Third Party Account, to instruct you how to confirm your registration.</p><h3 id="h-42-business-information" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.2. Business Information. </h3><p>If you wish to use a Service then you may be required to provide us with certain information about your business and business personnel ("Business Information"). Such information may include Personal Information about yourself or your business personnel. If you provide, or make available, any Personal Information about any business personnel you must first notify them and obtain their consent to disclose such information to us. Your participation in the Service is optional and you at all times have the choice of choosing whether to provide any Personal Information. Please be aware though that any failure to provide requested information may preclude your business from being approved to obtain funding from us. Fundbox currently uses Envestnet / Yodlee, Inc. (“Yodlee”) to gather data from financial institutions. By using our service, you grant Fundbox and Yodlee the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Yodlee in accordance with the Yodlee Privacy Policy.</p><h3 id="h-43-purchases" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.3. Purchases. </h3><p>The Service may include the option to purchase certain products or services from us (for example, to obtain funding). If you choose to make a purchase we (or one of our affiliated companies) will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service provider.</p><h3 id="h-44-contact-us-information" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.4. 'Contact Us' Information. </h3><p>If you send us a "Contact Us" request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available on the Site or by sending an email to an email address that we display on the Site, you may be required to provide us with certain information such as your name and email address.</p><h3 id="h-45-log-files" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.5. Log Files. </h3><p>We may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track user's movement around the Services, and gather demographic information.</p><h3 id="h-46-cookies-and-other-data-collection-technologies" class="font-semibold text-xl mt-4 md:mt-7 mb-4">4.6. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies. </h3><p>As is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers also collect information about your device, browsing actions and website usage patterns automatically when you visit or interact with our website, including log data (such as your internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL you entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of your visit, the time you spent on our services and any errors that may occur during your visit to our services), analytics data (such as the electronic path you take to our website, through our website and when exiting our website, as well as your usage and activity on our website) and location data (such as your general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect). We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on your computer and (ii) other, similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to automatically collect this personal information.</p><p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.  Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our website, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all. Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.
