For example, if you have $60,000 and you use only $20,000, you will only have to pay interest on the $20,000 used. This is in contrast to a term loan, where you are charged interest on the full lump sum. When it comes to fees, make sure you understand them upfront.

A business line of credit operates like a credit card as explained above, with a revolving balance, but they tend to offer lower interest rates, and there are no fixed payments.

If you can’t make your full payment, the interest compounds on the new principal amount. That means, one missed payment can lead to larger and larger payments in the future.
