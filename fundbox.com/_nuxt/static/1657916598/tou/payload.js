THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER FUNDBOX USERS.\n\nii. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single arbitrator administered by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at [http:\u002F\u002Fwww.adr.org](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.adr.org\u002F). Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Fundbox may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Fundbox subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and\u002For Fundbox, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Fundbox users. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Fundbox also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of Fundbox services.
